										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me say 3 things right off the bat. 1. This is a really really long article. 2. They only spend, like a paragraph on <em>Ideonella sakaiensis.</em> 3. They argue that enzyme recycling is feasible and I am not sure of that. About that single paragraph however, why don&#8217;t they let the little creatures eat the plastic and then do something with them? Is that too hard to grasp. I mean maybe they make good fertilizer? Anyway right now plastic is getting into everything including our bodies, so they better find something to do with it fast. Feeding it too microscopic organisms sound good to me.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="bolded">ince the first</span> factories began manufacturing polyester from petroleum in the 1950s, humans have produced an estimated 9.1 billion tons of plastic. Of the waste generated from that plastic, less than a tenth of that has been recycled, researchers <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700782">estimate</a>. About 12 percent has been incinerated, releasing dioxins and other carcinogens into the air. Most of the rest, a mass equivalent to about 35 million blue whales, has accumulated in landfills and in the natural environment. Plastic inhabits the oceans, building up in the guts of seagulls and great white sharks. It rains down, in tiny flecks, on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412019330351/">cities</a> and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaz5819">national parks</a>. According to some research, from production to disposal, it is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions <a href="https://theconversation.com/plastic-warms-the-planet-twice-as-much-as-aviation-heres-how-to-make-it-climate-friendly-116376">than the aviation industry</a>.</p>
<p>This pollution problem is made worse, experts say, by the fact that even the small share of plastic that does get recycled is destined to end up, sooner or later, in the trash heap. Conventional, thermomechanical recycling — in which old containers are ground into flakes, washed, melted down, and then reformed into new products — inevitably yields products that are more brittle, and less durable, than the starting material. At best, material from a plastic bottle might be recycled this way about three times before it becomes unusable. More likely, it will be “downcycled” into lower value materials like clothing and carpeting—materials that will eventually be disposed of in landfills.</p>

<p>“Thermomechanical recycling is not recycling,” said Alain Marty, chief science officer at Carbios, a French company that is developing alternatives to conventional recycling.</p>
<p>“At the end,” he added, “you have exactly the same quantity of plastic waste.”</p>
<p>Carbios is among a contingent of startups that are attempting to commercialize a type of <a href="https://cefic.org/a-solution-provider-for-sustainability/chemical-recycling-making-plastics-circular/">chemical recycling known as depolymerization,</a> which breaks down polymers — the chain-like molecules that make up a plastic — into their fundamental molecular building blocks, called monomers. Those monomers can then be reassembled into polymers that are, in terms of their physical properties, as good as new. In theory, proponents say, a single plastic bottle could be recycled this way until the end of time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mitigation efforts always sound sensible to sensible people. There are always people who have a knee jerk, industry involved NO WAY reaction. Just like with cigarettes: doesn&#8217;t cause it -you can&#8217;t prove it, to ok maybe it exists but there is nothing you can do about it, to those methods won&#8217;t work, to if you outlaw it you will put people out of work. But most people (as far as the carbon economy goes) Carbon Taxes, Carbon Trading and Carbon Reduction methods all seem OK. But how can you tell if they work, or in this case DON&#8217;T?</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">Beyond the crest of the Klamath Mountains, you descend into an evergreen medley of sugar pines, incense cedars and still more Douglas firs. As you continue into the Cascade Range, you pass through sparser forests dominated by Ponderosa pines. These tall, slender trees with prickly cones thrive in the hotter, drier conditions on the eastern side of the state.</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">All trees consume carbon dioxide, releasing the oxygen and storing the carbon in their trunks, branches and roots. Every ton of carbon sequestered in a living tree is a ton that isn’t contributing to climate change. And that thick coastal forest can easily store twice as much carbon per acre as the trees deeper inland.</p>

<p>From the air it looks like a huge lake, fed by many tributaries, but on the ground it turns out to be a murky expanse of water, in which no fish or algae can survive. The shore is coated with a black crust, so thick you can walk on it. Into this huge, 10 sq km tailings pond nearby factories discharge water loaded with chemicals used to process the 17 most sought after minerals in the world, collectively known as <a class="u-underline" title="" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/27/rare-minerals-global-renewables-industry" data-link-name="in body link">rare earths</a>.</p>
<p>The town of <a class="u-underline" title="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baotou" data-link-name="in body link">Baotou</a>, in Inner Mongolia, is the largest Chinese source of these strategic elements, essential to advanced technology, from smartphones to GPS receivers, but also to wind farms and, above all, electric cars. The minerals are mined at Bayan Obo, 120km farther north, then brought to Baotou for processing.</p>
<p>The concentration of rare earths in the ore is very low, so they must be separated and purified, using hydro-metallurgical techniques and acid baths. <a class="u-underline" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">China</a> accounts for 97% of global output of these precious substances, with two-thirds produced in Baotou.</p>
<p>The foul waters of the tailings pond contain all sorts of toxic chemicals, but also radioactive elements such as thorium which, if ingested, cause cancers of the pancreas and lungs, and leukaemia. “Before the factories were built, there were just fields here as far as the eye can see. In the place of this radioactive sludge, there were watermelons, aubergines and tomatoes,” says Li Guirong with a sigh.</p>

<h2 class="body title">1. The Animals of Chernobyl Survived Against All Odds</h2>
<p class="body">The effects of the radioactive explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on April 26, 1986 devastated the environment. Around the plant and in the nearby city of Pripyat in Ukraine, the Chernobyl disaster’s radiation caused the leaves of thousands of trees to turn a rust color, giving a new name to the surrounding woods—the <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/56235-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-33-years-later-wildlife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Forest</a>. Workers eventually bulldozed and buried the radioactive trees. Squads of Soviet conscripts also were ordered to <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-happened-to-the-dogs-of-chernobyl-the-harrowing-events-of-the-tv-series-are-sadly-true-17928470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoot</a> any stray animals within the 1000-square-mile Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Though experts today believe parts of the zone will remain unsafe for humans for another <a href="https://www.livescience.com/39961-chernobyl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20,000 years</a>, numerous animal and plant species not only survived, but thrived.</p>
<h2 class="body title">2. Bears and Wolves Outnumber Humans Around the Chernobyl Disaster Site</h2>
<p class="body">While humans are strictly prohibited from living in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, many other species have settled there. Brown bears, wolves, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/33677/canada-lynx-ghost-cat-north" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">lynx</a>, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59248/whats-difference-between-bison-and-buffalo" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">bison</a>, deer, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59461/10-gigantic-facts-about-moose" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">moose</a>, beavers, foxes, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64760/10-resourceful-facts-about-badgers" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">badgers</a>, wild boar, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/70797/12-surprising-facts-about-raccoon-dogs" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">raccoon dogs</a>, and more than 200 species of birds have formed their own ecosystem within the Chernobyl disaster area. Along with the larger animals, a variety of amphibians, fish, worms, and bacteria makes the unpopulated environment their home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is kinda funny because my blog is an accumulator blog and these guys are the maximum accumulators. Having lived in New Orleans for 12 years you can smell it, you can taste and there are days when you just should stay inside. Then there is the urban detritus, it rained 110 inches one year and the flooding was horrid. Walking through the water everyday I faced motor oil, gasoline and even used syringes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I should very quickly say &#8211; the way things are done now. The mining industry, as it functions in the past and now, destroys things no matter what it is extracting &#8211; gold, lead or lithium. So if we are going to have a real revolution we are going to have to change the entire extraction industry. This point is larger for me than this article implies because capitalism is the problem. We as a society can achieve a carbon negative atmosphere and humans will still threaten the planet because that it what capitalism does &#8211; destroys thing. Still you have to start somewhere.</p>

<p>Deep in the salt flats of Chile lies the extractive frontier of the renewable energy transition.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="article-content mb-5">
<p>Clean energy advocates envision an electrified home running on 100 percent renewable energy with a Tesla parked in its garage, solar shingles gleaming on its rooftop, and a smart meter dutifully collecting usage data and uploading it to the cloud. But swim upstream and eventually you arrive at the extractive frontiers of the renewable energy transition.</p>
<p>It was 8:45 am on the first day of the 11th Lithium Supply &amp; Markets Conference in the basement level of the W Hotel in Santiago, Chile. There was no way for me to blend in. “Providence College” on my name tag rendered me a curiosity. Still, I was glad I remembered to wear lipstick and that my backpack had straps that converted it into a tote.</p>
<p>I found an empty seat in the sea of suits, almost all men but of different ages. They hailed variously from China, Australia, Chile, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Argentina. They were market analysts and prospectors; equipment salesmen and regulators; executives, consultants, and peddlers of information in the notoriously opaque world of lithium, a “space,” in Silicon Valley talk, not quite meriting the word “market.”</p>
<p>As I slid into my seat, the chairman of one of the largest lithium companies in the world, with a sordid past in a corrupt privatization process under Augusto Pinochet’s brutal dictatorship, took to the stage. “Mining is the spine of Chile; mining runs through our veins.” I might have been the only person in the room who immediately thought of Eduardo Galeano’s anti-colonial page-turner, <i>Open Veins of Latin America</i>?—?incidentally penned the same year Pinochet came to power, brutally crushing the dream of democratic socialism in Chile. But I don’t think the chairman meant to call to mind the vampiric iconography of global capital. The dead sapping the living; the blood and sweat and tortured landscapes of extraction, especially in its colonial variant.</p>

<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="19">The lawsuit, filed in a Sacramento-based U.S. district court, argues the state stepped outside its proper constitutional lane by making a deal with the Canadian province on a cap-and-trade deal for limiting carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="20">The move is the latest in a series of actions the Trump administration has taken against California as it simultaneously challenges the state’s authority to set aggressive greenhouse gas emissions-cutting mandates on vehicles and complains the state has been too lax in confronting local pollution problems.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="21">The administration argues that the Constitution bars states from making treaties or compacts with foreign powers &#8212; like the regional cap-and-trade agreement California entered into with Quebec in 2013.</p>

<p>Unusually hot and dry conditions in parts of the northern hemisphere have been conducive to fires raging from the Mediterranean to – in particular – the Arctic. Climate change, with rising temperatures and shifts in precipitation patterns, is amplifying the risk of wildfires and prolonging the season.</p>
<p>WMO’s Global Atmosphere Watch Programme has released a <a href="http://https://youtu.be/ZfJsedQlio0">short animation</a> which highlights the risks and explains how advances in satellite technology make it possible to detect and monitor fire dangers. Improving forecasting systems is important for predictions and warnings around fire danger and related air pollution hazards.</p>
<p>In addition to the direct threat from burning, wildfires also release harmful pollutants including particulate matter and toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and non-methane organic compounds into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Particles and gases from burning biomass can be carried over long distances, affecting air quality in regions far away.</p>
