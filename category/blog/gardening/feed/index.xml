<p>As cities grow and incomes rise around the world, more and more people are leaving gardens and traditional diets behind and eating refined sugars, refined fats, oils and resource- and land-intense agricultural products like beef. This global dietary transition is harming the health of both people and the planet, says new research.</p>
<p>But the study also shows that shifting away from this trajectory and choosing healthier traditional Mediterranean, pescatarian or vegetarian diets could not only boost human lifespans and quality of life, but also slash emissions and save habitat for endangered species.</p>
<p>And we better hurry; the scientists project that if the trend continues, the situation will be worse yet with greenhouse gas emissions up by 80 percent by 2050.</p>
<p>Examining almost 50 years’ worth of data from the world’s 100 most populous countries, University of Minnesota Professor of Ecology G. David Tilman and graduate student Michael Clark illustrate how current diet trends are contributing to ever-rising agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and habitat degradation.</p>
<p>On top of that, they write: “These dietary shifts are greatly increasing the incidence of Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and other chronic non-communicable diseases that lower global life expectancies.”</p>

<p>Organic farming methods help take carbon dioxide from the air and lock it in the soil – a process known as carbon sequestration.</p>
<p>Our brainy friends at the Soil Association have <a href="https://www.soilassociation.org/better-food/our-campaigns/save-our-soils/research-references/" target="_blank">calculated</a> that if all UK farmland converted to organic farming, at least 3.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide would be taken up by the soil each year.</p>
<p>Organic farming and renewable energy go hand-in-hand, so we’re thrilled to be teaming up with the Soil Association to sponsor <a href="http://www.goodenergy.co.uk/organic-september" target="_blank">Organic September</a> for the fourth year running.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes I am a Headline Whore. But this is a very real nitty gritty get your hands dirty post. Most of the posts here are about environmental theories, or solar power writ large. But many environmental issues involve a compost pile and turning them, or washing off crud from recyclables. In this case if you have grass, and live in town you have to cut it. That means you have maintenance things to attend to. So here they are.</p>

</section>
<p>Following the <strong>lawn tractor maintenance</strong> advice in your tractor’s manual is the best way to keep it humming along smoothly. But owner’s manuals usually only tell you basically what to do and when to do it—they seldom include the tips and real-world wisdom gained through experience. So we asked veteran mechanics which steps are the most important and how to make <strong>lawn tractor maintenance and tubeless tire repair</strong> faster and easier.</p>
<p>You’ll save too. Dealers typically charge more than $200 for routine maintenance that includes an oil change and new spark plugs and filters. But you can do all these things—and more—in just a few hours. A <strong>lawn tractor maintenance</strong> kit from your dealer (less than $75) might cost a few bucks more than buying parts separately but ensures that you get all the right stuff. And new tubes for a <strong>tubeless tire</strong> repair cost from $5 &#8211; $15.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I found myself doing 2 big things today: saucing tomatoes and contemplating what to do with Paw Paws. On the same theme I was considering what to post today when the two lines ran together. Of course when you plant a trees (Paw Paws) you are fighting global warming. Harvesting your own food (Paw Paws and tomatoes) is both buying local and cutting transportation costs at the same time.</p>
<p>So this is the Arbor Day Foundations take.</p>

<h1>How Trees Fight Climate Change</h1>
<p class="intro">Whether you plant trees around your home and property, in your community, or in our national forests, they help fight climate change. Through the natural process of photosynthesis, trees absorb <span class="caps">CO<sup>2</sup></span> and other pollutant particulates, then store the carbon and emit pure oxygen.</p>
<p>See how planting trees helps fight climate change.</p>

<h1>Small Ozarks Farm Provides Innovative Example For Sustainable Living</h1>
<div> Article | <time datetime="2012-12-05" content="2012-12-05T17:14:31-06:00">December 5, 2012 &#8211; 5:14pm</time> | By <a href="http://ksmu.org/author/shane-franklin" rel="foaf:publications">Shane Franklin</a></div>
<p>One farm in the Ozarks is the location of a series of unique experiments in sustainable living.  If these experiments prove successful, it would greatly affect the future of sustainable technologies and how people think about building their homes. KSMU’s Shane Franklin had the opportunity to tour the farm, and has this story.</p>
<p>Rockspan Farm, the home of Dan and Margy Chiles, is unique in so many ways. They wanted to build a farm that could be an example to others, and a test lab for experimental technologies they’ve been personally developing over the years.</p>
<p>“We are trying a number of new technologies here to make houses more efficient and to make a livable space without having to burn a lot of coal.</p>

<p>RockSpan is the name for our 12 acre farm and house in western Greene County, Missouri.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project is the West end of Division street, 11 miles from Springfield, Missouri.   The colorful plan below shows the family farm: approximately 227 acres outlined in red with a possible land use plan.  Our 12 acres are inside the larger farm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting &#8220;laid to rest&#8221; is a two part process. There is preparing you and there is the ground you go into. Yesterday I covered the ground you go into part with Roselawn Cemetery which is a dated term I suppose but it is what I know. Today we take a look at the services that get you there. Jenn Bormann is with Butler Funeral Home and she was at Earth Awareness Fest with Clada Parker. They had with them a woven willow casket complete with a basket style top and an optional silk liner. Wow is all I can say. A casket you could leak out of, that is a very winning concept! Sorry I probably wasn&#8217;t supposed to say that but I am a loud mouth sometimes. Anyway I found this story about them in the SJR and I will put up their website as well. I did not want to just copy text from their website, because that is way to commercial for this nonprofit.</p>

<p>Not only is it possible to go green. Among the newer trends in the funeral home business is going out green.</p>
<p>BUTLER FUNERAL HOMES and ROSELAWN MEMORIAL PARK of Springfield have obtained certification from the national Green Burial Council for sustainable funeral and cemetery practices, eco-friendly products and even organic snacks at the wake.</p>
<p>Butler is getting in early on the green-certification trend as far as central Illinois goes, but president Chris Butler said he expects others to follow.</p>
<p>“Some of this includes elements people are already asking for. They just don’t call it ‘green,’” Butler said of practices that include non-toxic embalming fluids or no embalming at all, using only natural stone, limiting loss of natural habitat, biodegradable caskets, burial shrouds instead of caskets and use of renewable products.</p>
<p>Butler Funeral Homes Inc. is among the city’s older businesses. Forerunner funeral homes date to 1893.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.safelawns.org/blog/">http://www.safelawns.org/blog/</a></p>
<h2><a title="Permanent Link to PBS Program to Showcase Glenstone’s Organic Lawn" href="http://www.safelawns.org/blog/index.php/2012/04/pbs-show-to-showcase-glenstones-organic-lawn/" rel="bookmark">PBS Program to Showcase Glenstone’s Organic Lawn</a></h2>
<p>The natural lawn care movement in the United States will get a major boost in August when <a href="http://www.growingagreenerworld.com/">Growing A Greener World</a>, hosted by Joe Lamp’l, showcases the organic lawn renovation at <a href="http://www.safelawns.org/blog/index.php/2012/02/the-glenstone-model-a-landscape-plan-for-businesses-municipalities-everywhere/">Glenstone</a>, the modern art museum in Potomac, Md. The episode, estimated to be watched by nearly a million people nationwide in its first run, is scheduled to be aired in late August.</p>
<p>SafeLawns was on-hand, both to observe and to participate in the segment. We have been the lead consultants on the project since its inception in July of 2010 and the Growing a Greener World team is the first film crew to be allowed on the 160-acre Glenstone property, which has not had any synthetic chemicals used on its grounds since our arrival.</p>
<p>The two-day shooting session began in dreary, cold and wet conditions on Monday that ultimately led the crew indoors to the College Park laboratory of Dr. Mark Carroll and Dr. Thomas Turner, the two University of Maryland scientists who are working on an organic lawn research project with SafeLawns and Glenstone. The following day in Potomac, however, temperatures were in the 60s under brilliant blue skies.</p>
<p>“When you look at this place, the only thing you can say is ‘Wow,’” said Lamp’l, who is in his third season with this show.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technically they are called Reel Lawn Mowers. They are not easy to use. They push tough and you have to cut your grass alot because they do not handle high grass at all. For example our mower deck is set at 4 inches, so we cut grass at 6 inches. No way you can do that with a push mower. If you like short grass and you have a small yard, they are perfect. This article takes its own sweet time getting to the point.</p>

<h1>Mowing the Grass is Greener When You Don’t Use a Gas-Powered Mower</h1>
<h2>Lawn Mowers May Account for Five Percent of U.S. Air Pollution, EPA Says</h2>
<p id="by">From <a href="http://environment.about.com/od/environmentalorganizations/a/earthtalk-bio.htm" rel="author">Earth Talk</a></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Dear EarthTalk: I’ve heard that gas-powered lawn mowers, despite their small engine size, actually pollute as much as cars. If this is true, is there a greener way to cut my grass? </strong><br />
– <em>Jon Haufe, Seattle, WA</em></p>
<p>Reports about those noxious fumes emitted from gasoline lawn mowers are indeed true. A Swedish study conducted in 2001 concluded, “Air pollution from cutting grass for an hour with a gasoline powered lawn mower is about the same as that from a 100-mile automobile ride.” Meanwhile, the 54 million Americans mowing their lawns each weekend with gas-powered mowers may be contributing as much as five percent of the nation’s air pollution, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p>
<p><strong>Small Engines Lead to Big Pollution Problems</strong><br />
The problem is that small engines emit disproportionately large amounts of carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides that contribute to smog. The human health effects of smog-laden air are well known, and include inflammation and damage to lungs, increased risk of asthma attacks, and lowered levels of oxygen in the bloodstream, which can aggravate heart conditions.</p>
<p><strong>New Standards Expected to Reduce Mower Emissions</strong><br />
Fortunately, the EPA is now phasing in new emissions standards for gas mower engines that will result in a 32 percent smog reduction for all models made starting in 2007. And with even more stringent standards slated to go into effect soon in California, environmental leaders are hoping that the old adage for automobile trends (“as goes California, so goes the nation”) will soon apply to lawn mowers too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know lawn mowing seems trivial in some respects, but for this blog it is purposeful behavior. Behavior that can be modified. Mowers do not start themselves nor do they drive around by themselves. So for millions of us every time you start a mower think about it. Do you really need to do this and is this mower the right one for the job?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.peoplepoweredmachines.com/faq-environment.htm">http://www.peoplepoweredmachines.com/faq-environment.htm</a></p>
<h1>Cleaner Air : Gas Mower Pollution Facts</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.peoplepoweredmachines.com/mower_compare.htm">Push Mower Comparison Chart</a></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">EPA Statistics: Gas Mowers represent 5% of U.S. Air Pollution</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Each weekend, about 54 million Americans mow their lawns, using 800 million gallons of gas per year and producing tons of air pollutants. Garden equipment engines, which have had unregulated emissions until the late 1990&#8217;s, emit high levels of <a href="http://www.peoplepoweredmachines.com/faq-environment.htm#pollutants">carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides,</a> producing up to 5% of the nation&#8217;s air pollution and a good deal more in metropolitan areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a new gas powered lawn mower produces volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides emissions air pollution in in in one hour of operation as 11 new cars each being driven for one hour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Gardeners Spill More than the Exxon Valdez</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">And speaking of gas, the EPA estimates that over 17 million gallons of fuel, mostly gasoline, are spilled each year while refueling lawn equipment. That&#8217;s more than all the oil spilled by the Exxon Valdez, in the Gulf of Alaska. In addition to groundwater contamination, spilled fuel that evaporates into the air and volatile organic compounds spit out by small engines make smog-forming ozone when cooked by heat and sunlight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><a name="calculate"></a>Calculate Your Gas Mower&#8217;s Emissions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"> Until 1995, lawnmower emissions were unregulated. Older more powerful, less efficient two-cycle engines release 25-30% of their oil and gas unburned into the air. Gas mowers emit hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen (the principle ingredients of smog), particulate matter (damaging to the respiratory system), carbon monoxide (a poisonous gas) and carbon dioxide (contributing to global warming). The health toll includes cancer as well as damage to lungs, heart, and both the immune and detoxification systems. Plus smog inhibits plant growth. </span>Lawnmowers are currently subject to EPA’s Phase 2 regulations. These requirements have reduced volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides emissions by over 70 percent from unregulated levels.
