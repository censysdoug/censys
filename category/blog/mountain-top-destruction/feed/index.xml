										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I should very quickly say &#8211; the way things are done now. The mining industry, as it functions in the past and now, destroys things no matter what it is extracting &#8211; gold, lead or lithium. So if we are going to have a real revolution we are going to have to change the entire extraction industry. This point is larger for me than this article implies because capitalism is the problem. We as a society can achieve a carbon negative atmosphere and humans will still threaten the planet because that it what capitalism does &#8211; destroys thing. Still you have to start somewhere.</p>

<h1>What Green Costs</h1>

<div class="article-dek">
<p>Deep in the salt flats of Chile lies the extractive frontier of the renewable energy transition.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="article-content mb-5">
<p>Clean energy advocates envision an electrified home running on 100 percent renewable energy with a Tesla parked in its garage, solar shingles gleaming on its rooftop, and a smart meter dutifully collecting usage data and uploading it to the cloud. But swim upstream and eventually you arrive at the extractive frontiers of the renewable energy transition.</p>
<p>It was 8:45 am on the first day of the 11th Lithium Supply &amp; Markets Conference in the basement level of the W Hotel in Santiago, Chile. There was no way for me to blend in. “Providence College” on my name tag rendered me a curiosity. Still, I was glad I remembered to wear lipstick and that my backpack had straps that converted it into a tote.</p>
<p>I found an empty seat in the sea of suits, almost all men but of different ages. They hailed variously from China, Australia, Chile, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Argentina. They were market analysts and prospectors; equipment salesmen and regulators; executives, consultants, and peddlers of information in the notoriously opaque world of lithium, a “space,” in Silicon Valley talk, not quite meriting the word “market.”</p>
<p>As I slid into my seat, the chairman of one of the largest lithium companies in the world, with a sordid past in a corrupt privatization process under Augusto Pinochet’s brutal dictatorship, took to the stage. “Mining is the spine of Chile; mining runs through our veins.” I might have been the only person in the room who immediately thought of Eduardo Galeano’s anti-colonial page-turner, <i>Open Veins of Latin America</i>?—?incidentally penned the same year Pinochet came to power, brutally crushing the dream of democratic socialism in Chile. But I don’t think the chairman meant to call to mind the vampiric iconography of global capital. The dead sapping the living; the blood and sweat and tortured landscapes of extraction, especially in its colonial variant.</p>

<p class="speakable-p-1 p-text">The embers of the coal industry have been slowly fading in recent years, despite efforts by the Trump administration to reignite the flames.</p>
<p class="speakable-p-2 p-text">But an announcement this week from a northern Indiana utility — in the heart of a state that ranks in the top 10 for both coal production and consumption — suggests the end may be nearer than some expect.</p>
<p class="p-text">After having already announced plans to <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/environment/2018/09/20/move-over-coal-indiana-utility-switching-solar-and-wind/1369539002/" data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a">speed up the retirement of its coal power plants</a>, the Northern Indiana Public Service Company said this week that it will switch to renewable energy to make its electricity instead.</p>
<p class="p-text">Why? Because it&#8217;s cheaper. A lot cheaper, they said, to the tune of more than $4 billion over a few decades. Still, those long-term savings might come with a short-term price. The utility is asking for a raise in its rates to upgrade infrastructure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is true. He killed more people than Son of Sam and the Zodiac Killer and he got a year in jail. Why? Because he is a rich white and the death resulted from &#8220;mine safety violations&#8221;. So, you know, he never had a &#8220;direct hand&#8221; in their deaths. What a joke. He claims he lives in Las Vegas now, so I hope he wonders off in the desert and suffers a horrible death.</p>

<h1 class="title">US mine blast: Ex-coal CEO Blankenship at end of prison term</h1>
<p><strong>CHARLESTON, W.Va.</strong> &#8212; Former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship is finishing up a one-year federal prison sentence arising from the deadliest U.S. mine explosion in four decades.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons website, Blankenship was set to be released Wednesday from a halfway house in Phoenix, Arizona. He must serve one year of supervised release.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad he had time to reflect on the pain he caused,&#8221; former U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin, whose office in Charleston prosecuted the case, said in a text message to The Associated Press ahead of Blankenship&#8217;s release. &#8220;I hope he used it wisely and will come out of prison ready to make amends.&#8221;</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t immediately clear where Blankenship will serve his supervised release. After his indictment, federal prosecutors indicated Blankenship owned homes in several states, and Blankenship said he lived in Las Vegas. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office in Charleston referred questions to the federal Bureau of Prisons.</p>
<p>A bureau spokesman and Blankenship&#8217;s attorney, William Taylor, didn&#8217;t return requests for comment</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have a saying. If you can&#8217;t make it work under capitalism and socialism is already leaving you voluntarily then you are pretty much done for this world. It looks like coals time has come and gone and it is the same with nuclear power too. Thank the gods that be. Now the question is, is it too late? We are walking a tight rope on that one. If we can come up with some remediations we just might pull out of this very steep climate dive. It is going to be close.</p>

<h1>Flurry of Coal Power Plant Shutdowns Expected by 2016</h1>

<p class="article-byline-p"><a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/what-we-do/people/bobby-magill"><img decoding="async" alt="Bobby Magill" src="http://www.climatecentral.org/images/sized/images/sized/remote/assets-climatecentral-org-images-uploads-team-bobbyMagill-50x50.jpg" /></a> By <a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/what-we-do/people/bobby-magill" rel="author">Bobby Magill</a></p>
<p>A flurry of coal-fired power plants — major sources of climate change-fueling carbon dioxide emissions — could be closed by 2016, according to U.S. <a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=15031" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Energy Information Administration forecasts</a>.</p>
<p>New emissions regulations and low natural gas prices, partly because of the fracking boom throughout the U.S., are leading utilities to shut down coal-fired power plants and open new ones that burn natural gas. With new <a href="http://www.epa.gov/mats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Environmental Protection Agency emissions standards </a>limiting mercury, acid gases and toxic metals from coal-fired power plants taking effect in 2015, there is even more impetus for utilities to retire older coal plants, according to the EIA.</p>
<p>Because of those new standards, the EIA forecasts that 90 percent of the power plants expected to shut down by 2020 will actually be shut down by 2016. Those new standards include coal-fired power plants likely having to install flue gas desulfurization equipment, or “scrubbers,” which cost <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/business/205808551.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hundreds of millions of dollars each</a>, depending on the size of the plant.</p>
<p>Utilities may decide to shutter a coal-fired power plant if coal prices, wholesale electricity prices and the costs of installing scrubbers do not make economic sense, according to the EIA.</p>
<p>Coal-fired power plants are feeling the heat about carbon emissions, too. Concern about coal plants’ carbon emission contributing to climate change are driving the EPA to <a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/news/coal-industry-joins-long-line-in-bid-to-shape-epa-rules-16727" target="_blank" rel="noopener">write new carbon emissions rules</a> unrelated to the new mercury standards. The EPA has proposed new regulations <a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/news/new-epa-emissions-regs-pack-little-punch-on-climate-16531" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aiming to curb carbon emissions</a> from future coal-fired power plants and is in the process of proposing similar regulations governing existing coal power plants.</p>

Mainly because of integration and the regulation of tobacco (not to mention the moonshiners). This attack on all things paid for by taxes has continued unabated for the last 60 years. But really, 2 major rivers have suffer significant contamination in the past month and nothing has been done? Nothing. West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and now North Carolina and Virginia, and no legislation has been proposed. We do not even have testing to find out what these contaminates really are. And in the second case no studies into MGHM to say even what the chemical does. Really?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was going to start a meditation on Environmental and Energy Conservation websites today but then I got to this story in the Illinois Times. I am actually citing the one from the St. Louis Dispatch but you can find the Illinois Times one here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.illinoistimes.com/Springfield/article-10536-state-gives-ameren-a-pollution-pass.html">http://www.illinoistimes.com/Springfield/article-10536-state-gives-ameren-a-pollution-pass.html</a></p>
<p>So here is the piece from the SLD, mainly because I hardly ever link up with them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/state-and-regional/illinois/ill-regulators-delay-ameren-pollution-controls/article_123019f5-fe57-5971-9600-4f4c4d7281cb.html">http://www.stltoday.com/news/state-and-regional/illinois/ill-regulators-delay-ameren-pollution-controls/article_123019f5-fe57-5971-9600-4f4c4d7281cb.html</a></p>
<h1>Ill. regulators delay Ameren pollution controls</h1>
<p>State regulators have granted Ameren Corp. a five-year delay in the installation of pollution controls at a large coal-fired power plant in southeastern Illinois after the company threatened to close other plants and cut hundreds of jobs.</p>
<p>The Illinois Pollution Control Board granted the delay Thursday, giving the St. Louis-based company until 2020 to install equipment to control smog, which is linked to heart and lung problems. The company had initially agreed to do it by 2015.</p>
<p>Ameren had argued that because of the drop in electricity prices _ driven in part by competition from natural gas plants _ it could no longer afford to finish installing sulfur dioxide scrubbers at its Newton plant under the original timetable.</p>
<p>Environmental groups lambasted the regulators&#8217; decision, saying it undercuts the state&#8217;s pollution standards. Ameren said the move was necessary to save jobs.</p>

<h1>U.S. coal use falling fast as utilities switch to gas</h1>
<h3>By Jonathan Fahey, Associated Press</h3>
<p>NEW YORK – America is shoveling coal to the sidelines.</p>
<p>The fuel that powered the <a title="More news, photos about U.S." href="http://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/U.S">U.S.</a> from the industrial revolution into the iPhone era is being pushed  aside as utilities switch to cleaner and cheaper alternatives.</p>
<p>The  share of U.S. electricity that comes from coal is forecast to fall  below 40% for the year, its lowest level since World War II. Four years  ago, it was 50%. By the end of this decade, it is likely to be near 30%.</p>
<p>&#8220;The peak has passed,&#8221; says Jone-Lin Wang, head of Global Power for the energy research firm IHS CERA.</p>
<p>Utilities  are aggressively ditching coal in favor of natural gas, which has  become cheaper as supplies grow. Natural gas has other advantages over  coal: It produces far fewer emissions of toxic chemicals and gases that  contribute to climate change, key attributes as tougher environmental  rules go into effect.</p>

<p>The new EPA rulings will finally bring to fruition President Obama&#8217;s promise his policies will necessarily bankrupt the coal industry.</p>
<p>Four years ago, then-candidate Barack Obama explained his anti-coal energy policy in an editorial board meeting with the San Francisco Chronicle: &#8220;Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket. Even regardless of what I say about whether coal is good or bad.&#8221;  &#8220;So if somebody wants to build a coal plant, they can &#8211; it&#8217;s just that it will bankrupt them.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the 2010 elections saw a landslide defeat of those politicians in the house and senate who supported skyrocketing our utility rates through cap and trade and put an end to President Obama&#8217;s aspirations in a new energy tax.</p>
<p>But that didn&#8217;t put an end of efforts to kill the coal industry and the day after the landslide defeats of the 2010 elections, President Obama said  &#8220;Cap-and-trade was just one way of skinning the cat; it was not the only way. It was a means, not an end. I&#8217;m going to be looking for other means to address this problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that the EPA began to enact regulation by bureaucratic fiat rather than the legislative process.</p>
<p>Even staunch supporters in the labor unions are beginning to wake up to the fact that they are being regulated out of a job if the Obama administration has its way.  The Keystone Pipeline rejection already has hit the labor unions hard by halting the creation of 20K plus jobs in the construction industry.</p>
