Seriously does the world need a bigger excuse to intervene? Hell, we started a War in Vietnam over shots that WEREN&#8217;T fired. China has taken over countries just because a 1,000 ago they were part of China. But messing with multiple Nuclear Power Plants ain&#8217;t enough? Earth&#8217;s Countries are going to mess around here and have a real disaster on its hands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me very quickly say, that I wish no immediate harm to the simpering moron (sigh). I am not urging anybody anywhere to do any harm to the coal toad.  All I am say is that after he dies of Black Lung, I hope bad things happen to him.</p>
<p>He is not even a Democrat. He is a DINO: Democrat In Name Only. He knows the majority is thin and thus his power is great. So behind the flag of Fiscal Responsibility he argues for a smaller bill. A Bill that can &#8220;get paid for&#8221;. What gets dropped out of that smaller bill? Surprise! Surprise! The Climate Change program that his coal sucking buddies hate. I mean this is from Vanity Fair for God&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p class="has-dropcap">Although <strong>Joe Manchin</strong> has been holding up <strong>Joe Biden</strong>’s infrastructure plans for a while now over the price tag, the West Virginia senator has been somewhat cagey about his actual demands. Not as guarded, perhaps, as <strong>Kyrsten Sinema</strong>, his fellow Democratic holdout; where she has <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/09/what-exactly-does-kyrsten-sinema-want">refused</a> to state her terms to anyone outside the White House, Manchin at least engages with his colleagues and speaks publicly about his objections to the reconciliation bill. But he’s been difficult to pin down nonetheless, adding to the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/nancy-pelosi-democrats-infrastructure-deal">frustrations</a> of Democrats as they seek to deliver on the centerpiece of Biden’s domestic agenda.</p>
<p>Finally, while his terms are coming into clearer view, they’re only casting the future of the infrastructure bills in a thicker cloud of uncertainty. Now, the question isn’t only if the Biden bills will pass. It’s whether the bills will be recognizable if they do. Axios on Sunday <a class="external-link" href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-manchins-red-lines-f9f5f7f7-56d8-4bf6-8345-13abb75ef03f.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=editorial&amp;utm_content=politics-childtaxcredit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://www.axios.com/scoop-manchins-red-lines-f9f5f7f7-56d8-4bf6-8345-13abb75ef03f.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=editorial&amp;utm_content=politics-childtaxcredit" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.axios.com/scoop-manchins-red-lines-f9f5f7f7-56d8-4bf6-8345-13abb75ef03f.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=editorial&amp;utm_content=politics-childtaxcredit&quot;}">reported</a> that Manchin has given something of an ultimatum to the White House: He’ll support the child tax credit that would be one of the package’s biggest boosts to working families, but only if it&#8230;well, does less to help working families. Manchin is asking for the credit to include a work requirement and an income cap that would make families earning more than $60,000 ineligible for assistance—a demand that would weaken a key part of the spending bill. He is also, as Axios reported, continuing to rail against provisions of the reconciliation bill that are crucial to addressing climate change, <a class="external-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/climate/manchin-climate-biden.html?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20211017&amp;instance_id=43090&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;regi_id=56298477&amp;segment_id=71906&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=2abb12c11b787f32a2358bbfc4aeefd0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/climate/manchin-climate-biden.html?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20211017&amp;instance_id=43090&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;regi_id=56298477&amp;segment_id=71906&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=2abb12c11b787f32a2358bbfc4aeefd0" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/climate/manchin-climate-biden.html?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20211017&amp;instance_id=43090&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;regi_id=56298477&amp;segment_id=71906&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=2abb12c11b787f32a2358bbfc4aeefd0&quot;}">supposedly</a> because of concerns that the shift to clean energy the Biden plan would help usher in could cost jobs in the coal state of West Virginia.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nuclear Power was always too EXpensive to meter. But when the Nuclear Choo-Choo Train got going in the 60s everyone was in love with the new technology, the marvelous future, how many decades the plants could run and the massive power produced that the regulators publicly patted the Utility Guys on the back and quietly passed the costs on to ratepayers. This is what should have happened from the very beginning.</p>

<h1 data-test-locator="headline">Failed nuclear contractor signs $21M deal, working with feds</h1>
<p>The chief contractor at a failed multibillion-dollar project to build two nuclear reactors in South Carolina has agreed to pay more than $20 million as part of a cooperation agreement with federal authorities probing the fiasco.</p>
<p>Under an agreement announced Monday by Acting U.S. Attorney Rhett DeHart, Westinghouse Electric Co. will contribute $5 million to a program intended to assist low-income ratepayers affected by the project’s failure. Another payment of $16.25 million will be due before July 1, 2022.</p>
<p>The company will also be required to cooperate with federal investigators still probing the company&#8217;s role in the 2017 debacle, which cost ratepayers and investors billions and left nearly 6,000 people jobless.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just like CANCER. That was the first thought I had when I read this article. Evidence was gathered 60 years ago. People spoke up, and the oil and gas industry killed any discussion. Now we are stuck with more powerful Hurricanes. We are stuck with the American west being consumed by droughts and fire. The Arctic is gone and the Antarctic going. The world should confiscate their wealth and apply every dime to remediating the effects. Unfortunately the whole world never does anything. I mean the UN could pass a resolution but Pfffhh.</p>

The diagnosis was dramatic. It warned of the emergence of a new era of weird weather, leading to political unrest and mass migration (which, in turn, would cause more unrest). The new era the agency imagined wasn’t necessarily one of hotter temperatures; the CIA had heard from scientists warning of global cooling as well as warming. But the direction in which the thermometer was traveling wasn’t their immediate concern; it was the political impact. They knew that the so-called “<a title="" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/29/little-ice-age" data-link-name="in body link">little ice age</a>”, a series of cold snaps between, roughly, 1350 and 1850, had brought not only drought and famine, but also war – and so could these new climatic changes.</span></p>
<p class="dcr-s23rjr">“The climate change began in 1960,” the report’s first page informs us, “but no one, including the climatologists, recognized it.” Crop failures in the Soviet Union and India in the early 1960s had been attributed to standard unlucky weather. The US shipped grain to India and the Soviets killed off livestock to eat, “and premier Nikita Khrushchev was quietly deposed”.</p>
<p class="dcr-s23rjr">But, the report argued, the world ignored this warning, as the global population continued to grow and states made massive investments in energy, technology and medicine.</p>

<p>An emergency is a serious situation that requires immediate action. When someone calls 911 because they can’t breathe, that’s an emergency. When someone stumbles on the sidewalk because their chest is pounding and their lips are turning blue, that’s an emergency. Both people require help right away. Multiply those individuals by millions of people who have similar symptoms, and it constitutes the biggest global health emergency in a century: the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Now consider the following scenarios: A hurricane blasts Florida. A California dam bursts because floods have piled water high up behind it. A sudden, record-setting cold snap cuts power to the entire state of Texas. These are also emergencies that require immediate action. Multiply these situations worldwide, and you have the biggest environmental emergency to beset the earth in millennia: climate change.</p>
<p>Given the circumstances,<em> Scientific American</em> has agreed with major news outlets worldwide to start using the term “climate emergency” in its coverage of climate change. An official statement about this decision, and the impact we hope it can have throughout the media landscape, is below.</p>

<h2 class="wsite-content-title">Hydrologic History of the Tulare Basin</h2>
<div></div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Tulare Basin historically supported an amazing complex of wetland habitats, unique in the world. This largely flat and arid region served as the floodplain for water flowing west from the southern Sierra Nevada, north from the Transverse Ranges, as well as from small intermittent arroyos flowing east from the Coast Ranges. Oak woodlands and riparian forests formed green corridors across the broad prairie on the eastern edge of the Tulare Basin. Freshwater tule marshes and alkaline wetlands adorned the slow-moving sloughs and shallow margins of Kern, Buena Vista, Goose, Tulare, and Summit lakes. Emergent marsh vegetation, such as tules and cattails, grew in permanent standing water at the shallow edges of freshwater wetlands. Upslope from the marshes, water intermittently flooded iodine bush scrub and alkali grassland habitats.</p>
<p>This highly-productive, shallow water system supported abundant populations of endemic lake-adapted fishes such that American white pelicans (Pelacanus erythrorhynchos) nested by the thousands on islands in Tulare Lake and Buena Vista Lake. The Tulare Basin&#8217;s extensive wetland habitats historically attracted significant numbers of resident and migratory waterbirds, including grebes, pelicans, cormorants, herons, egrets, ibises, geese, swans, ducks, rails, sandhill cranes, plovers, stilts, avocets, sandpipers, phalaropes, gulls, and terns.</p>
<p>The conversion of this water system to a lake-and-slough wetland to agriculture began in the mid-1800s when European settlers began to build canals and diversion structures to irrigate their crops.  This early irrigation infrastructure upstream from Tulare Lake slowly cut off the lake from its source waters, shrinking the lake&#8217;s footprint.  By 1899 &#8211; less than 50 years after irrigation was initiated &#8211; Tulare Lake went dry for the first time in history.</p>

<p class="body">In 2012, a group of French researchers found phthalates in the body of every ant they sampled. Ants from France, Hungary, Spain, Morocco, the Greek island Egine, and Burkina Faso all had at least some of the common plastic additive embedded in their skin. In the conclusion to the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24713390">paper</a> announcing their findings, they added a restless-sounding note: “In an attempt to find ants bearing no phthalate on their cuticle,” they wrote, they would next look farther afield. There had to be ants out there not yet full of plastic.</p>
<p class="body">But there were not. Five years later, the team published their follow-up. They had sampled ants from the most remote forests of Guyana, and the areas in the Amazon rainforest farthest from any urban center. Again, phthalates were embedded in their skin. “These findings suggest that there is no such thing as a ‘pristine’ zone,” they wrote in a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304744861_Phthalate_pollution_in_an_Amazonian_rainforest">2017 paper</a>.</p>

<p>At least 26 people have died and 165 others are missing in northern India after part of a Himalayan glacier broke off, sending a wall of water and debris into two hydroelectric dams.</p>
<p>More than 2,000 members of the military, paramilitary groups and police are carrying out search-and-rescue missions after Sunday&#8217;s incident in the state of Uttarakhand.</p>
<p>The deluge destroyed one dam, damaged another and washed homes away downstream.</p>
<p>The focus of teams&#8217; efforts was on saving 37 workers trapped inside a tunnel at the Dhauliganga project, one of the affected hydropower plants, officials said.</p>
<p>A portion of Nanda Devi glacier broke off in the Tapovan area of Uttarakhand state on Sunday, with the subsequent flooding damaging the Rishiganga and Dhauliganga hydropower projects, officials said.</p>

<p>In 2015 nearly 200 nations committed to the Paris Agreement, which aims to prevent the worst impacts of climate change by limiting global warming by 2100 to less than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. The U.S. pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. Then Donald Trump was elected president. He soon announced that the U.S. would <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/u-s-exits-paris-climate-accord-after-trump-stalls-global-warming-action-for-four-years/">pull out of the accord</a>, and his administration spent four years relentlessly rolling back regulations intended to curb emissions and protect the environment. Dozens of coal-burning power plants, the worst carbon polluters, shut down anyway as market forces expanded the role of cheaper, cleaner natural gas, wind and solar power. And various states, cities and industries cut emissions. Yet even with that progress, Trump&#8217;s rollbacks could add the equivalent of <a href="https://rhg.com/research/the-rollback-of-us-climate-policy/">1.8 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere</a> by 2035, according to the Rhodium Group, an independent research organization.</p>
<p>Joe Biden must now make up for lost time, and last November he said the U.S. would rejoin the Paris Agreement immediately after he became president. This commitment is important because the U.S. is still the world&#8217;s second-largest emitter, behind China, and it can return as a world climate leader. But Biden will also have to ratchet up the original U.S. pledge because warming—and its effects—has only sped up since the Paris Agreement was established. Biden promised to issue an executive order calling for net-zero emissions by 2050, but he will need to set specific interim targets. The World Resources Institute says reducing emissions to <a href="https://www.wri.org/news/biden-climate-action-priorities">45 to 50 percent below</a> 2005 levels by 2030 could put the country on track.</p>
<p>Congressional legislation is the most effective way to create the concrete policies needed to achieve those goals because it gives federal agencies clear priorities, is much harder to override with presidential actions, and can better withstand legal challenges that might be brought by industry or special-interest groups. But the divided U.S. Senate will make sweeping laws hard to pass. Biden will have to work through executive orders and will have to charge federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency with issuing new regulations under existing laws such as the Clean Air Act. He will need to “turn every stone possible,” says Narayan Subramanian, an environmental lawyer working with the Center for Law, Energy &amp; the Environment at Berkeley Law. The most immediate focuses are transportation, power plants, methane emissions and pesky hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs).</p>
<p>With coal plants retiring, transportation has surpassed power generation as the country&#8217;s largest carbon emitter. The quickest action Biden can take to tackle those emissions is to reinstate California&#8217;s waiver to the Clean Air Act, allowing the state to enforce its Advanced Clean Cars regulations. The regulations set fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light-duty trucks that are tougher than federal rules, which means fewer emissions. In the past, automakers have built their nationwide fleets to meet the state&#8217;s standards to avoid making two versions of their vehicles, and some states, such as New York, typically follow California&#8217;s lead. The Rhodium Group estimates that reinstating the waiver would save about 573 million metric tons of emissions by 2035.</p>
