										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As A HUGE disclaimer, my wife are both union members. Our prents were Union members. My great grandfather was a card carrying Socialist and ran for City Alderman in Chicago as such. So I believe in Unions. But when they get stuck on saving jobs no matter what. They get a little lost and sometimes real lost. These becomes apparent with police unions &#8211; though appropo to this topic. They protect bad cops for jobs sake. Well, the IBEW and other unions are no better. Instead of saying, &#8220;We will change power plant jobs for better jobs in the green sector&#8221;. They say, &#8220;We will not lose the jobs we have&#8221;. They act like it is heroic when it is pathetic.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/5/22/18628299/green-new-deal-labor-union-2020-democrats">https://www.vox.com/2019/5/22/18628299/green-new-deal-labor-union-2020-democrats</a></p>
<div class="c-entry-hero__header-wrap">
<h1 class="c-page-title">The Green New Deal is fracturing a critical base for Democrats: unions</h1>
</div>
<p class="c-entry-summary p-dek">National labor leaders oppose the Green New Deal but some state unions endorse it. That’s a challenge for presidential contenders.</p>
<div class="c-byline"><span class="c-byline-wrapper"> By <span class="c-byline__item"> <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/umair-irfan" data-analytics-link="author-name"><span class="c-byline__author-name">Umair Irfan</span></a> </span> <span class="c-byline__item"> Updated <time class="c-byline__item" datetime="2019-06-19T13:24:49" data-ui="timestamp"> Jun 19, 2019, 9:24am EDT </time> </span> </span></div>
<p id="opk71z">As a statement of principles and goals, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/12/21/18144138/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez">Green New Deal</a> seems to take economic justice and workers’ rights pretty seriously. It calls for a federal jobs guarantee. It says we need workforce retraining, strengthening collective bargaining rights, retirement security, and universal health care.</p>
<p id="u617zM">The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hres109/BILLS-116hres109ih.pdf">resolution</a> decries “antilabor policies” and says it must be fleshed out with input from “frontline and vulnerable communities, labor unions, [and] worker cooperatives,” with the goal of creating “high-quality union jobs.”</p>
<p id="ARigMl">Which is why it was so surprising that the leader of the national AFL-CIO — the largest federation of labor unions in the United States, representing more than 12.5 million workers — recently came out against the proposal.</p>
<p id="bxSEK1">“We weren’t part of the process, so the worker’s interest wasn’t really figured into it,” AFL-CIO president <a href="https://livestream.com/accounts/27531088/events/8651345/videos/190374708">Richard Trumka</a> said in April. “We would want a whole bunch of changes made so that workers and our jobs are protected in the process.”</p>
<p id="X675Sd">(Disclosure: I was on the bargaining committee of the Vox Media Union. We organized with Writers Guild of America, East, which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO.)</p>
<p id="dV1JP7">But this week, Maine Gov. Janet Mills signed her state’s version of a Green New Deal with the backing of labor unions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week&#8217;s articles says &#8211; Not Likely. I say the trees are a good start. The point is that some people argue for trees or solar panels in the desert for instance. But the desert is an ecosystem that trees or solar panels would disrupt. Deserts are not &#8220;throw away&#8221; ecosystems. So we can only deploy so much of each. This is why i think geothermal is the ultimate solution.</p>

<p>Last week, a new study in the journal <em><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Science (opens in a new tab)">Science</a></em> highlighted the role forests could play in <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2019/07/04/could-planting-tons-of-trees-solve-climate-change/#.XR9vR9NKjm1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="tackling climate change (opens in a new tab)">tackling climate change</a>. Researchers estimated that by restoring forests to their maximum potential, we could cut down atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) by 25 percent — a move that would take us back to levels not seen in over a century. Though the study brings hope in the fight against climate change, other experts warn the solution is not that simple.</p>
<p>The study, led by scientists at ETH-Zürich, Switzerland, determined the planet has 0.9 billion hectares of land available to hold more trees — an area the size of the continental U.S. Converting those areas into forests would be a game-changer for climate change, the authors suggested.</p>
<p>“[The study] is probably the best assessment we have to date of how much land could support tree cover on our planet,” says Robin Chazdon, a forest ecologist and professor emeritus at the University of Connecticut not involved in the study, But she is quick to point out that restoring forests is not as simple as it sounds.</p>

<p>Go there and think. More next week.</p>

<p class="speakable-paragraph">As 2018 comes to a close, it&#8217;s time to review the top energy stories of the year. This year there wasn&#8217;t an overwhelming choice for the top story as we have had in some previous years (e.g., the Deepwater Horizon spill), but many of the year&#8217;s biggest developments impacted oil prices.</p>
<p>Here are my picks for the stories that shaped the year in energy.</p>
<p><strong>Oil price roller coaster</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_spt_s1_d.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_spt_s1_d.htm">price</a> of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) opened the year at $60/bbl. Brent crude was just under $67/bbl. By early October, on the back of several developments that are covered in other stories below, WTI was closing in on $80/bbl and Brent was above $86/bbl. But then prices collapsed in part because the ongoing trade war with China caused them to stop importing U.S. oil, and in part because sanctions on Iranian exports were waived at the last moment &#8212; after Saudi Arabia had already increased production to compensate for Iran&#8217;s lost exports. The overall impact was a collapse in the price of oil. As we head into the last week of the year, WTI has fallen to $45/bbl and Brent crude is at $54/bbl.</p>
<div id="article-0-inread"></div>
<p><strong>U.S. shatters oil production record</strong></p>
<p>Early in 2018, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) announced that the previous monthly record for <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MCRFPUS2&amp;f=M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MCRFPUS2&amp;f=M">U.S. crude oil production</a> &#8211; 10.044 million BPD set in November 1970 &#8212; had been broken. U.S. oil production would continue to rise steadily throughout 2018, reaching 11.475 million BPD by September 2018 (the last month for which monthly numbers are available).</p>
<p><strong>China slows solar program</strong></p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>I hate that last one. Go there and read. More next week.</p>

<h1>Coal, nuclear plant operator files for bankruptcy, asks Trump for a bailout</h1>
<h2>FirstEnergy&#8217;s request comes after regulator struck down an industry-wide bailout plan.</h2>

<p>On Saturday, power corporation FirstEnergy placed its coal and nuclear generation units <a href="https://cms.arstechnica.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=226681&amp;action=edit">under chapter 11 bankruptcy</a>. Although coal and nuclear plants across the country have struggled to compete with the low prices of natural gas, FirstEnergy&#8217;s filing is unique because it stands to take on a political dimension. Just two days before FirstEnergy&#8217;s bankruptcy filing, the company petitioned the Department of Energy (DOE) for an emergency bailout, <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/firstenergy-asks-doe-for-emergency-action-to-save-pjm-coal-nuke-plants/520280/">citing concerns about reliability</a>.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p>The petition could reinvigorate a debate started by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/energy-secretary-proposes-rule-to-make-grid-managers-favor-coal-nuclear/">proposed a rule</a> last year to change how coal and nuclear plants are compensated for their power. The rule was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/federal-regulator-denies-rick-perrys-proposal-to-compensate-coal-nuclear/">denied by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> (FERC), which said that there was not enough evidence to justify changing how coal and nuclear are compensated.</p>
<p>FirstEnergy disparaged FERC&#8217;s decision in <a href="https://statepowerproject.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/fes-202c-application.pdf">its Thursday petition</a> (PDF), claiming that &#8220;as a result of FERC’s and the RTO&#8217;s [Regional Transmission Organization&#8217;s] failure to address this crisis, swift and decisive action is needed <em>now</em> to address this imminent loss of nuclear and coal-fired baseload generation and the threat to the electric grid that this loss poses&#8221; (emphasis FirstEnergy&#8217;s).</p>

<h1>Feature: China and the New Energy Economy</h1>
<div class="clr"></div>
<p class="commondate">London (Platts)&#8211;31 Oct 2017 1239 pm EDT/1639 GMT</p>
<p>There is an increasingly inescapable sense that an energy transition of enormous proportions is taking place. The number of &#8216;bans&#8217; announced on Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles is growing, even if governments are placing them relatively far out on the political horizon.</p>
<p>More and more car manufacturers are taking note and shifting R&amp;D spending into Electric Vehicles (EVs), a move which has profound implications for the development curves, and thus future cost, of EVs versus ICE vehicles.</p>
<p>In October, US automaker General Motors said that it would launch two new pure electric models in 2018 and a further 18 by 2023.</p>
<p>Its competitor Ford announced the creation of a new internal team to &#8220;think big and move fast&#8221; in order to accelerate the electrification of its auto production. Both are some way behind their European counterparts.</p>
<p>It is not hard to see why such decisions are being made now. While the number of EVs on the road remains just a fraction of the total parc, global sales are growing by about 40% year-on-year, making EVs the biggest growth story in the auto market in decades.</p>
<p>And, if governments are going to regulate against ICE vehicles and subsidize EVs, thereby changing the consumer choices which otherwise might be made, then what other path is there to tread?</p>

<div><strong>Fifth Annual Energy Report</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Dozens of clean energy records have been shattered across the</div>
<div>United States in the last year and a half. Solar energy is growing at an</div>
<div>unprecedented rate and the first U.S. offshore wind farm now provides</div>
<div>clean electricity off the coast of Rhode Island. Grid operators and utilities</div>
<div>are implementing new techniques and grid improvements that allow us</div>
<div>to integrate more clean energy into America’s electricity system without</div>
<div>compromising reliability. At the same time, states and utilities have</div>
<div>increased their energy efficiency investments, reducing energy waste and</div>
<div>energy costs across the U.S. economy. Taken together, the United States is</div>
<div>slashing climate-changing and other harmful pollutant seven as national</div>
<div>energy spending hits record lows. Cities, states, and businesses recognize</div>
<div>the economic advantages of clean energy and have taken the lead on U.S.</div>
<div>climate action and must continue to do so. It is clear that a low-carbon</div>
<div>future is more affordable and achievable than ever. The last year and a half</div>
<div>has proved that, despite some new political headwinds, ever-improving</div>
<div>economics can propel the clean energy transition in the years to come.</div>
</div>
<div class="textLayer">
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>The good news is we don’t have to choose between the</div>
<div>environment and a booming economy. Clean energy</div>
<div>not only reduces pollution harmful to public health</div>
<div>and our environment, it is also one of the fast-growing</div>
<div>areas for U.S. jobs and contributes billions to the U.S.</div>
<div>economy annually.</div>
<div></div>
<div>1   Energy efficiency and renewable energy are already</div>
<div>the cheapest sources of new energy</div>
<div>in the United States over the life of the investment.</div>
<div></div>
<div>2   Building new wind and solar farms is even expected to be</div>
<div>cheaper than running existing coal and gas plants within</div>
<div>the next decade.</div>
<div></div>
<div>3   Clean energy (from energy efficiency</div>
<div>improvements and renewable resource additions) already</div>
<div>employs almost 3 million Americans.</div>
<div></div>
<div>4,5   That is more than</div>
<div>twice the number of jobs in the U.S. fossil extraction and</div>
<div>production industries.</div>
<div></div>
<div>6   Energy efficiency supports the bulk of clean energy</div>
<div>employment in America today, providing permanent, well-</div>
<div>paying jobs in the design, manufacturing, construction, and</div>
<div>installation of energy-efficient buildings and appliances. In</div>
<div>addition, energy efficiency plays a crucial role in keeping</div>
<div>U.S. manufacturing and other industries competitive in a</div>
<div>global market—reducing energy waste, lowering the costs</div>
<div>of domestic production, and making our facilities some</div>
<div>of the most efficient in the world. The U.S. Department of</div>
<div>Energy (DOE) estimated in 2016 that with more aggressive,</div>
<div>but feasible, investments in energy efficiency, industry</div>
<div>could save up to an additional 7.5 quads of energy annually</div>
<div>by 2030—about 35 percent of all power used by industry</div>
<div>in 2016, or about the total amount of energy used by 50</div>
<div>million Americans in a year.</div>
<div></div>
<div>7, 8   These electricity savings</div>
<div>would be worth almost $30 billion annually (using 2016</div>
<div>average electric prices for industry).</div>
<div></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was going to post on many things. There was the list of the most affordable cars or the robot that got inside of Fukushima nuclear power plant or even dissecting the new report from Rick Perry&#8217;s Department of Energy&#8217;s on renewables effect on the power grid. Still I have never heard of solar power on a train before, so this is what they say.</p>

<div class="attribution W-60 Ell"><img decoding="async" class="D-ib Mend-5 Va-m Logo W-a H-a" src="https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/Wj2HEUuPUhjQmlN5WRPfag--/YXBwaWQ9eW15O3c9MTUwO3NtPTE-/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2016-10-05/04fa4660-8b0f-11e6-8636-cbc0321bcf4b_AFP-logo.jpeg" alt="" /> <span class="Provider Pend-6">AFP</span> <span class="Timestamp">4 hours ago</span></div>
<p>India has added solar panels to the roof of a train in a national first as it tries to reduce its massive carbon footprint and modernise its vast colonial-era rail network.</p>
<p>The lighting, fans and information displays inside the train &#8212; once powered by diesel &#8212; will run off the sun&#8217;s energy after the panels were fitted to the carriage.</p>
<p id="yui_3_18_0_4_1500482705133_15044">The train has begun journeys around the capital New Delhi, helping move just some of the 23 million passengers who use India&#8217;s rail network every day.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will be inducting at least four other solar-powered trains in the next six months,&#8221; Anil Kumar Saxena, Indian railways spokesperson, told AFP on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Batteries charged by the solar panels during the day take over if there is no sunlight, Saxena added. Only as a last resort, if the batteries perish, would diesel be used.</p>

<p>I wonder what happens when they go through a tunel. Anyway, go there an read. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me be clear here, the transition to clean energy sources will be painful because it is unplanned. Consider this: What if the Federal Government had a plan to move away from fossil fuels with clear benchmarks for the shift and training programs to move workers into that market. Well, plants would be closed on a schedule that everyone knows in advance, and there would be no pain. Only growth and prosperity. The way we are going about it now, Nuclear Power gets classified as &#8220;green&#8221;, plants are shuttered and workers are thrown out of their jobs. Brilliant.</p>

<h1 class="article-headline">Two Ohio coal-fired plants to close, deepening industry decline</h1>
<div id="article-byline"><span class="author">By <a href="http://www.reuters.com/journalists/emily-flitter">Emily Flitter</a></span> <span class="location"><span class="divider">|</span> NEW YORK</span></div>
<p>Electricity company Dayton Power &amp; Light said on Monday it would shut down two coal-fired power plants in southern Ohio next year for economic reasons, a setback for the ailing coal industry but a victory for environmental activists.</p>
<p>Republican President Donald Trump promised in his election campaign to restore U.S. coal jobs that he said had been destroyed by environmental regulations put into effect by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Dayton Power &amp; Light, a subsidiary of The AES Corporation, said in an emailed statement that it planned to close the J.M. Stuart and Killen plants by June 2018 because they would not be &#8220;economically viable beyond mid-2018.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coal demand has flagged in recent years due to competition from cheap and plentiful natural gas.</p>

<p>Go there and jump for joy (I mean read). More next week.</p>
