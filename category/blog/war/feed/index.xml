										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Isn&#8217;t Russia Special. They are so inept they want to cause a second nuclear disaster at Chernobyl. Seriously does the world need a bigger excuse to intervene? Hell, we started a War in Vietnam over shots that WEREN&#8217;T fired. China has taken over countries just because a 1,000 ago they were part of China. But messing with multiple Nuclear Power Plants ain&#8217;t enough? Earth&#8217;s Countries are going to mess around here and have a real disaster on its hands.</p>

With just 78 planes in the air and Tanks running out of fuel the Russian attack appears uncoordinated and without passion. There are even rumors of Russian Units laying down their guns. In part here is why. Think about Brazil attacking Spain.</p>

<p>Russia&#8217;s economy is &#8220;incredibly unimportant in the global economy except for oil and gas,&#8221; Jason Furman, a Harvard economist and former advisor to President Barack Obama, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/21/business/economy/ukraine-russia-economy.html?smid=tw-share" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="3833ffc99460c6de181a669dc35eb096">The New York Times.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s basically a big gas station,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His comments come as the West prepares <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/21/statement-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-on-russian-announcement-on-eastern-ukraine/" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="7bd2d70c52d7b2017ceccb055122336e">heavy sanctions</a> on Russia if it invades Ukraine. While they have the potential to throw the Russian economy into chaos, these measures could also reverberate to further damage the US, Europe, and the rest of the world as they battle inflation and rising energy prices — a ripple effect that the West hopes to mitigate.</p>
<p>On Monday, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/map-where-are-donetsk-luhansk-ukraine-russia-2022-2" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="f1a4c149a6bb8c3977ad89ca46bfbafb">Moscow declared the independence of two breakaway regions of Ukraine and sent troops there</a> — escalating the prospect of a major war. President Joe Biden has already <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-orders-sanctions-russia-backed-eastern-ukraine-separatist-regions-2022-2" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="bf7125005aab9537167f85ca2b703e20">ordered sanctions</a> on the separatist regions — Donetsk and Luhansk — prohibiting US citizens from engaging in any exports, imports, or new investments in these areas.</p>
<p>Despite Russia&#8217;s size and wealth in raw materials, its economy is more on par with Brazil than with nations like Germany, France, and the UK, <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?most_recent_value_desc=false" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="60" data-uri="8081f643505061a94e157a69ddaf0bbb">according to the latest nominal GDP data from the World Bank.</a> According to the World Bank, Russia&#8217;s economy is smaller than Italy&#8217;s and South Korea&#8217;s, two nations with less than half of Russia&#8217;s population.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All they did really was put out the fires and bury the remains. It sits there moldering to this day. They cleaned up the first 3 ft. of soil and tore down the buldings. The buildings and other materials were shipped to New Mexico and Nevada for storage. See first, the history of Rocky Flats:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Flats_Plant">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Flats_Plant</a></p>
<p>The <strong>Rocky Flats Plant</strong> was a United States <a title="Nuclear weapon" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon">nuclear weapons</a> production facility near <a title="Denver, Colorado" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver,_Colorado">Denver, Colorado</a> that operated from 1952 to 1992. It was under the control of the <a title="United States Atomic Energy Commission" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Atomic_Energy_Commission">United States Atomic Energy Commission</a> (AEC) until 1977, when it was replaced by the <a title="United States Department of Energy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy">Department of Energy</a> (DOE).</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Then see her book:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/books/book-review-full-body-burden-by-kristen-iversen.html?_r=0">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/28/books/book-review-full-body-burden-by-kristen-iversen.html?_r=0</a></p>
<div>Publication Date: June 5, 2012</div>
<p><em>Full Body Burden</em> is a haunting work of narrative nonfiction about a young woman, Kristen Iversen, growing up in a small Colorado town close to Rocky Flats, a secret nuclear weapons plant once designated &#8220;the most contaminated site in America.&#8221; It&#8217;s the story of a childhood and adolescence in the shadow of the Cold War, in a landscape at once startlingly beautiful and&#8211;unknown to those who lived there&#8211;tainted with invisible yet deadly particles of plutonium.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a book about the destructive power of secrets&#8211;both family and government. Her father&#8217;s hidden liquor bottles, the strange cancers in children in the neighborhood, the truth about what was made at Rocky Flats (cleaning supplies, her mother guessed)&#8211;best not to inquire too deeply into any of it.</p>

<p>Go there and read. More tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right now we are involved in the largest war games ever held in the middle east in Jordan with 20 or so other nations participating. Isn&#8217;t that grand? And to top it off the President of Israel thinks the plan is worked out. This is so wrong in so many ways I lost count at 100. What a pitiful waste for so much promise in Obama.</p>

<p><strong>Kurt Nimmo</strong><br />
Infowars.com<br />
May 16, 2012</p>
<p>The U.S. ambassador to Israel, <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/the-us-military-option-for-iran-is-ready-american-ambassador-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Shaprio</a>, told a closed conference in Tel Aviv that the United States has completed preparations for a military strike on Iran. His comments were recorded by a reporter and aired on Israel’s Channel 2 TV on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>It would be preferable to resolve this diplomatically, and through the use of pressure, than to use military force,” Shapiro said. “But that does not mean that option isn’t available. Not just available, it’s ready. The necessary planning has been done to ensure that it’s ready.”</p>
<p>Shaprio’s comments were not intended for public consumption, the Times of Israel reports.</p>
<p>The finalized attack plan arrives as Israel and the United States prepare for joint military exercises in the United States. “The exercises, to be held in the coming months, will strengthen the relationship between the IAF and the US Air Force as they practice carrying out joint operations,” the Jerusalem-based online newspaper reported. “Israeli and US air defense forces are also to take part in a major joint drill later this summer in Israel to simulate a massive attack. Thousands of US soldiers are expected to arrive in Israel for the drills.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let us put aside the fact militaries themselves are a huge waste of money. It is estimated that for every 1 $$$ the US for instance spends on a bullet they get 75 cents in return. That is just if it sits on the shelf. If it is used of course it is worth nothing. Not to mention that lavishing spending on militaries brought Empires from the Egypt to the Soviet Union&#8217;s down. But the USA&#8217;s Military wastes energy like there is no tomorrow. The worst offenders of course are the Airforce and the Navy. The Airforce in particular spews kerosene byproducts into the upper atmosphere where they do the most harm and the Navy because they burn warm asphalt at sea. Not to mention the nuclear issues both as weapons and power sources. But think about our main battle tank. It is as big as a modest 2 story house and it runs on diesel. So the idea that they want to go to zero energy use is great. But I got my doubts.</p>

<h2>U.S. Army Launches Plan to Make All Military Bases Net Zero</h2>
<p>Posted  by <a title="Posts by Ggw Admin" href="http://globalgreenworld.org/?page_id=169&amp;uid=1">Ggw Admin</a> on Apr 19, 2011 in <a title="View all posts in Blog" rel="category" href="http://globalgreenworld.org/?cat=85">Blog</a> | <a title="Comment on U.S. Army Launches Plan to Make All Military Bases Net Zero" href="http://globalgreenworld.org/?p=736#respond">0 comments</a></p>

<p>Over the past couple of years, the U.S. Army has announced several  initiatives ranging from solar-powered tents for troops to  hydrogen-powered tanks, however this is their most ambitious program  yet. With the help of the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable  Energy  Laboratory (NREL), the U.S. Army is aiming to have all Army  installations across the country be net zero.</p>
<p><a href="http://inhabitat.com/u-s-army-launches-plan-to-make-all-military-bases-net-zero/usmilitary/"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://globalgreenworld.org/wp-content/plugins/rss-poster/cache/563ba_USmilitary-75x75.jpg" alt="" width="75" height="75" /></a></p>

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://globalgreenworld.org/wp-content/plugins/rss-poster/cache/df30c_USmilitary3-537x330.jpg" alt="Army Vision for Net Zero, Fort Bliss, net zero, renewable energy, U.S. Army, U.S. Military, Waste Reduction, water conservation" width="537" height="330" /></p>
<p>With funds from the DOE’s Federal Energy Management Program  (FEMP), the “Army Vision  for Net Zero” program will aim to meet  mandates to reduce energy as a result of  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/2009fedleader_eo_rel.pdf">Executive Order 13514</a>.  The order calls for all new  buildings to be net zero energy by 2030,  and it dictates a 30 percent reduction in water use and a 50 percent  reduction in waste that goes to landfills. On top of that, the National  Defense Authorization Act also mandates that the Army produce or acquire  25 percent of its energy from renewables by 2025.</p>
<p>“The first priority is less,” Assistant Secretary of the Army for   Installations, Energy  Environment Katherine Hammack said. “If you  use  less energy, you don’t have to buy as much – or you don’t have to  make  as much from alternative energy sources or renewable energy  sources. So  if you look at energy, that is a focus on energy efficiency.  If you’re  talking about water, then that’s water conservation. Or even  if you’re  talking about waste, that’s reducing the amount of waste we  have in  the steam.”</p>
<p>The program already has a poster child in the form of Fort Bliss. The  military base boasts solar daylighting in the dining facility,  warehouse and gym, energy-efficient windows, utility monitoring and  control for heating and air-conditioning systems in approximately 70  buildings, and plans to increase the on-site hybrid  waste-to-energy/concentrating solar power plant from 90 to 140  megawatts. The City of El Paso has committed to provide 1 million tons  per year of municipal solid waste, which will be transformed into energy  by the base.</p>
<p>“The Army’s net zero vision is a holistic approach to addressing   energy, water, and waste at Army installations,” Kingery said. “We look   at net zero as a force multiplier for the Army that will help us  steward  our resources and manage our costs.”</p>
<p>Considering that defense is a massive cause of national debt,  the  plan serves two purposes – reduced spending and “greening” national  security. If the military can get on board with renewable energy, it  makes you wonder why other areas of government are having such trouble.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I do not normally advise the US to attack third world countries. Especially over oil. But in this case the mad man is attacking his own people. The chaos is shutting down the oil fields in Libya and rippling through the oil world. He is threatening to set the oil fields on fire. He ordered naval vessels to bombard Tripoli. Where is the 5th Fleet when you need them.</p>

<p id="post-byline">By CNN<br />
Posted today at 10:37 a.m.</p>
<div id="attachment_32167"><a rel="attachment wp-att-32167" href="/?attachment_id=32167"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" title="Gas-Prices-Web" src="http://chicagobreakingbusiness.com/files/2011/02/Gas-Prices-Web.jpg" alt="" width="612" height="233" /></a>A customer purchases gasoline at a Chicago Shell station on Feb. 7, 2011.

</div>
<p>U.S. gas prices jumped 6 cents overnight, as the recent spike in oil  prices begins to hit filling stations across America. That marks the  third day in a row that prices have risen, and brings the national  average to the highest level since October 2008.</p>
<p>The national average price for a gallon of regular gas rose 5.9 cents  to $3.287, motorist group AAA said Friday.  Gasoline also jumped 6  cents overnight in Chicago, where prices averaged $3.497.</p>
<p>So far this week, gas prices have increased nearly 12 cents a gallon.  And analysts expect prices to continue higher in the next few days  following a sharp rise in the price of crude oil.</p>
<p>Gas prices were highest in Hawaii, where drivers paid $3.757 a  gallon, on average. Wyoming had the lowest gas prices at roughly, $3.014  a gallon.</p>
<p>The jump in pump prices follows a surge in prices for crude oil, the  main ingredient in gasoline. Oil prices were holding near $98 a barrel  early Friday morning, one day after prices hit a high of $103 a barrel —  the highest since October 2008.</p>
<p>Economists warn that an energy price shock could hurt the economic  recovery in the United States. In general, every $1 increase in the  price of oil costs consumers $1 billion over the course of a year.</p>
<p>That’s concerning because consumer spending makes up the bulk of U.S.  gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic growth.</p>
<p>Oil prices have been driven higher by political unrest in North  Africa and the Middle East, where much of the world’s oil comes from.  Despite the surge in prices this week, the amount of oil that has been  taken off the world market has been relatively minimal.</p>

<h2>Wednesday, February 23, 2011</h2>
<p><a name="3321988273599637004"></a></p>
<h3><a href="http://earlywarn.blogspot.com/2011/02/libya-oil-updates.html">Libyan Oil Grinding to a Halt</a></h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s the latest:</p>
<p>At least 300kbd-400kbd of oil production are shut-in already, and likely more, but the <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFLDE71M16J20110223">situation is still confusing</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>As much as a quarter of Libyan oil output has been shut  down, Reuters calculations showed on Wednesday, as unrest prompted oil  companies to warn of production cuts in Africa&#8217;s third-largest producer.</p>
<p>Austria&#8217;s OMV said on Wednesday it might be heading for a full  production shutdown in Libya. Total, Repsol, Eni and BASF have also said  they are either slowing or stopping output.</p>
<p>The latest comments point to a growing impact on oil output from Libya,  which produces 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of high-quality oil, or  almost 2 percent of world output. About 1.3 million bpd is exported,  mainly to Europe.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2052961,00.html">Time Magazine&#8217;s Robert Baer</a>, anonymous sources close to Gaddafi say he is now giving orders to sabotage Libya&#8217;s oil industry:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s been virtually no reliable information coming out of  Tripoli, but a source close to the Gaddafi regime I did manage to get  hold of told me the already terrible situation in Libya will get much  worse. Among other things, Gaddafi has ordered security services to  start sabotaging oil facilities. They will start by blowing up several  oil pipelines, cutting off flow to Mediterranean ports. The sabotage,  according to the insider, is meant to serve as a message to Libya&#8217;s  rebellious tribes: It&#8217;s either me or chaos.</p></blockquote>
<p>Libyan ports are <a href="http://www.portworld.com/news/i100899/Cargo_ports_in_Libya_closed_due_to_escalating_violence">shutting down</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Libyan cargo port operations have shut down due to increasing violence sweeping the country, Reuters has reported.</p>
<p>Operations at Tripoli, Benggazi and Misurata Mediterranean ports, which  handle general cargo and container shipping, have closed.</p></blockquote>
<p>In particular, oil exports appear to be <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international-business/libya-oil-ports-disrupted-italy-ready-to-use-gas-stocks/articleshow/7552829.cms">halting completely</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Operations at Libyan oil ports were disrupted by a lack of  communications, trade sources said, and flows from marine oil terminals  in Libya were halted on Tuesday, an Italian government source said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The situation is worrying. This morning the oil terminals were blocked in Libya,&#8221; the government source said.</p>
<p>It was not possible to get through by phone to Libyan oil ports or shipping agents on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is out,&#8221; said a source with a major oil company. &#8220;We can&#8217;t  get through to anyone. Our operations people say contact is impossible  with the shipping agents, port officials, anyone. The lines are all  down.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The country appears to be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/24/world/africa/24libya.html?_r=1&amp;hp">descending into civil war</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya kept his grip on the  capital on Wednesday, but large areas of the east of the country  remained out of his control amid indications that the fighting had  reached the northwest of the country around Tripoli.</p>
<p>Libyans fleeing across the country’s western border to Tunisia reported  fighting over the past two nights in the town of Sabratha, home of an  important Roman archeological site 50 miles west of Tripoli. Reuters  reported that thousands of Libyan forces loyal to Col. Qaddafi had  deployed there.</p>
<p>“The revolutionary committees are trying to kill everyone who is against  Qaddafi,” said a doctor from Sabratha who had just left the country,  but who declined to give his name because he wanted to return.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, as for the oil production losses, the Saudi&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/23/business/global/23oil.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">say they stand ready</a> to make up the difference:</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and read the rest. More tomorrow I am afraid.</p>

<p>He is the master of the bad word. He sits around and thinks up phrases like Nature Nazis, Envirowussies, and the &#8220;fear promoting business&#8221;. He hides behind the skirts of his right wing masters. You never see him in public and if only he had a last name like Drudge&#8230;.but he doesn&#8217;t&#8230;he sounds like a quarterback and looks like a pug.</p>

<p><font style="font-size: 16px; color: #bb1111; font-family: Georgia">The Drudge of Denial</font><br />
<font style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Georgia">Marc Morano</font><br />
<font style="font-size: 11px; font-style: italic; font-family: Georgia">Founder, Climate Depot</font></p>
<p>Morano, who worked for Sen. James &#8220;Global Warming is a Hoax&#8221; Inhofe, left Congress last year to set up shop as the Matt Drudge of climate denial. Today he runs Climate Depot, a website whose sponsor is funded by oil heir Richard Mellon Scaife. A private version of a congressional blog that Morano ran for Inhofe, the site serves as a clearinghouse for climate kooks. &#8220;He&#8217;s a central cell of the climate-denial machine,&#8221; says Kert Davies, research director for Greenpeace. &#8220;He&#8217;s been very effective in delaying action on this crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morano says climate scientists are in the &#8220;fear-promoting business&#8221; and accuses them of waging a &#8220;war on modern civilization.&#8221; But it&#8217;s Morano who trafficks in wild claims, routinely distorting the work of climate scholars and charging that &#8220;proponents of man-made global warming have been funded to the tune of $50 <em>billion</em>.&#8221; A former producer for Rush Limbaugh, Morano gained fame as one of the first to trumpet Swift-boat lies about John Kerry&#8217;s military record. Andrew Watson, a British climate professor who recently debated Morano on the BBC, said it best in a whispered aside at the end of the show: &#8220;What an asshole.&#8221;</p>
