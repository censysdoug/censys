<h1>Energy Secretary Chu Resigns Leaving Oil Markets in Turmoil</h1>
<div><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/raymond-j-learsy"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://s.huffpost.com/contributors/raymond-j-learsy/headshot.jpg" alt="Raymond J. Learsy" width="45" height="45" /></a></div>
<h2><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/raymond-j-learsy" rel="author">Raymond J. Learsy</a></h2>
<p>Author, &#8216;Oil and Finance: The Epic Corruption Continues&#8217;</p>
<p>In his <a href="http://www.doe.gov/articles/letter-secretary-steven-chu-energy-department-employees-announcing-his-decision-not-serve" target="_hplink" rel="noopener">letter of resignation</a> from the post of Energy Secretary, Chu characterized his Department as a &#8220;Department of Science, a Department of Innovation, and a Department of Nuclear Security.&#8221; He then goes on to point out the myriad achievements and initiatives during his tenure ranging from BioEnergy Research Centers, Wind and Solar Energy initiatives, nuclear safety, appliance efficiency standards and on. Not an unimpressive list of scientific and clean energy programs. Embedded deeply in his letter is his conviction that rising temperatures present a present and growing danger to the planet and need be addressed. His tenure at Energy addressed this issue relentlessly, and even with the $500 million Solyndra debacle, built a foundation for research, creativity, and with funding guarantees to a plethora of clean energy projects supporting manufacturing plants throughout the country.<br />
Were this his exclusive mandate his four year tenure might well be termed a success. But the Department also has other fish to fry. They relate no only to the environment, but profoundly to the economy and to our national security. Energy, be it oil, natural gas, coal are core commodities to the functioning of our economic viability, and here the Department of Energy under Chu&#8217;s tutelage has approached disaster.</p>
<p>As example, within a month of Chu&#8217;s ascendency the price of crude oil hovered around $35/barrel (and gasoline prices well under $2.00/gallon). Today&#8217;s price is over $95/bbl even though our oil consumption is down some 2.4% from what it was four years ago and production from the Bakken and EagleFord Formations in North Dakota and Texas has increased our domestic production dramatically keeping our domestic oil market amply supplied (oil inventories are at or near all time highs). In a situation such as this it is the Department of Energy&#8217;s obligation to ask some hard questions just as Energy Secretary Bill Richardson did during his tenure during the Clinton Administration when he personally lobbied OPEC members only to be chastised, to his great credit, by the OPEC spokesman, &#8220;In the forty year history of OPEC there has never been the case of the Secretary of Energy calling OPEC in the middle of an OPEC meeting&#8230; We are upset and disappointed at external pressure. We don&#8217;t like it.</p>

<div>Villa Åkarp: A super-efficient home that scores an A+ in surplus energy production</div>
<div>&#8230;</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>After construction wrapped up in 2009, Villa Åkarp&#8217;s energy-plus ambitions have come true: The super-insulated Swedish home&#8217;s rooftop solar system generates an excess of 600kWh annually.</div>

<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Keeping up with today’s <a href="http://www.mnn.com/your-home/remodeling-design/blogs/swedens-mini-house-20-offers-speed-sustainability-and-style-in-spa">mini-trend</a> of (shockingly) non-IKEA-related housing news coming out of Sweden, I thought I’d revisit a notable residential building project located outside of the city of Malmö that I first <a href="http://www.mnn.com/your-home/at-home/blogs/playing-catch-up-tgi-green">made mention of</a> way back in November 2009.</div>
<div></div>
<div>When I intially caught wind of said project, <a href="http://www.rockwool.se/inspiration/villa+%C3%A5karp">Villa Åkarp</a>, it was <a href="http://www.rockwool.com/press/news/news+view?newsid=1362">under construction</a> with the lofty ambition of becoming an energy-plus (or positive) home. In other words, the three-bedroom, two-bathroom home is not only influenced by stringent <a href="http://passiv.de/en/">Passivhaus</a> building standards that focus on energy recovery and conservation (high amounts of insulation, triple pane windows, thermal recovery, strategic building orientation, etc.), but energy generation as well. Thanks in part to a 32-square-meter rooftop photovoltaic array, the now-completed residence produces significantly more energy than it consumes. In all, the airtight home’s solar panels produce around 4,200 kilowatt hours (kWh) of juice per year (mainly during the summer months) with a surplus of around 600kWh annually that’s fed back into the grid in a partnership with local green utility provider<a href="http://www.eon.com/en.html"> E. ON</a>. That’s enough energy to power another energy-efficient home for two months.</div>

<p>Middle East beginning to embrace solar energy</p>
<p>By MICHAEL CASEY<br />
AP Environment Writer</p>
<p>ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) &#8212; Covering nearly 300 football fields in a remote patch of desert, the Shams 1 solar project carries off plenty of symbolic significance for the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>It will be the first, large-scale solar project in the oil-rich country when it is completed at the end of the year, and the largest of its kind in the Middle East. At full capacity, the 100-megawatt, concentrated solar project will be able to power 20,000 homes. For those behind the project, it&#8217;s the surest sign yet that solar is coming to the region in a big way.</p>
<p>&#8220;We truly believe solar will be a major contributor to meeting our own requirements,&#8221; said Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber, the UAE&#8217;s Special Envoy for Energy and Climate Change and the chief executive officer of government-funded Masdar, which is the majority investor in the project.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most Christians (and many other end of the Earth religions) assume that humans will be here when it happens. I got my doubts about that. The way we are treating the Earth we may be extinct in 50 years. Very few species make it for a couple million years let alone the billions we have to go but if we were smart we would be saving the nukes for the end.</p>

<h3>Why a Nuclear Free World is Important</h3>
<p>We are now facing an energy crossroad as a culture. Everyone was effected by the price of gas that peaked during the summer of 2008. The world has fallen into a consumer trap where a growing number of people around the world are using finite oil resources to drive to work. The energy it takes to drive a car is like having 700 human slaves pushing that vehicle for a few cents per hour. The era of oil is rapidly coming to an end as the entire planet hunts down the last accessible oil reserves. At the same time, the burning of fossil fuels is polluting the air and water. There is a global shift to move away from oil driven cars. This means electric cars or better, redesigning our communities so we work close to home.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, energy and environmental activists warned Americans about this coming crisis but were drowned out by the energy industry and the media&#8217;s failure to be honest with the public. In 1992, one half of the world&#8217;s Nobel Laureates signed onto a call that the world had 20 years to deal with our growing global energy and population crisis. That call was ignored by America&#8217;s leaders and the media. Some experts say we only have a few years to keep from being bankrupted by energy costs and global carrying capacity collapses.</p>
<p>The nuclear power industry has been claiming that it can rescue us from climate change and the coming energy crisis. Wrong! The arguments from this failed industry should not be trusted and in fact, represent a disastrous misuse of economic resources at such a critical moment. Their last experiment in Science Fiction has left the world neck deep in deadly wastes and economic boondoggles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pro  Nuke people always ignore the long chain that leads up to the first Nuclear reaction, including mining the dangerous ore and the tremendous construction costs. This chain may negate at least several years of their contention that Nuclear Power is &#8220;carbon free&#8221;. They also never discuss the after chain. Which includes both the disposal of the waste from the reactor but eventually the cost of decommissioning the reactors themselves. I think that Yucca Mountain was a perfect response to that, but I am alone on that one. This piece also mentions the distructive economic system that these reactors would perpetuate, which is disgusting. BUT the larger picture is that nuclear reactors are totally unnecessary. I have included here only the Monthly Review&#8217;s preface.</p>

<p><a title="On Nuclear Power" href="http://monthlyreview.org/2011/02/01/on-nuclear-power" rel="bookmark">On Nuclear Power</a></p>
<p>Response to John W. Farley’s ‘Our Last Chance to Save Humanity’</p>
<p><a title="Posts by Southern California Federation of Scientists" href="http://monthlyreview.org/author/scfssoutherncaliforniafederationofscientists" rel="author">Southern California Federation of Scientists</a> and <a title="Posts by John W. Farley" href="http://monthlyreview.org/author/johnwfarley" rel="author">John W. Farley</a></p>
<p><em>Monthly Review</em> has long been on record as opposed to the expansion of nuclear energy.<a id="fn1" href="http://monthlyreview.org/2011/02/01/on-nuclear-power#en1">1</a> Most recently, some of the dangers of nuclear power, both in its present form and with continuing new technological developments, were spelled out by Robert D. Furber, James C. Warf, and Sheldon C. Plotkin of the Southern California Federation of Scientists, in their article on “<a href="http://monthlyreview.org/2008/02/01/the-future-of-nuclear-power">The Future of Nuclear Power</a>” (<em>MR</em>, February 2008).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we recognize that many scientists, including climatologist James Hansen and our friend, physicist John W. Farley, now see a place for nuclear energy as a kind of last resort, given the dire planetary threat raised by the burning of fossil fuels—made even more dire by the current shift toward even dirtier, more carbon-emitting fossil fuels, such as lower grades of coal, oil from tar sands, and shale oil. If nuclear power presents great dangers to the human population and the earth, it also cannot be denied that the continuation of “business as usual” with respect to carbon emissions will lead to eventual social, economic, and ecological collapse, threatening civilization and most species, including our own. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that some are looking at nuclear energy as a lesser, or more remote, evil. Moreover, the prospect, though still at the theoretical/experimental stage, of revolutionary developments in nuclear power technology, namely Generation IV plants, which could greatly increase the efficiency of nuclear fuel use, reducing the nuclear waste generated, is also changing the nature of the controversy for some.</p>
<p>Yet, in our view, none of this alters the essential nature of the problem: the crossing of planetary boundaries by an economic system that, as long as it exists, must continually produce more and more goods, and thus degrade the environment. In this context, a turn to nuclear energy as a solution is both myopic and a Faustian bargain. The development of alternative energy sources coupled with conservation, in the context of radical transformations in social relations, constitutes the only real, long-term solution.</p>

<h1>Muzzling an Anti-Nuke Trial Defense</h1>
<div>
<div>November 21, 2012</div>
</div>
<p>By John LaForge</p>
<p>Three disarmament radicals who snuck into the Y-12 nuclear weapons complex last summer are preparing for their February 2013 trial, and face the prospect that any mention of nuclear weapons will be forbidden.</p>
<p>Y-12 is the 811-acre site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, that’s been building H-bombs and contaminating workers and the environment since 1943. On July 28, Sister Megan Rice, Michael Walli and Greg Boertje-Obed snipped through fences and walked up to the new Highly Enriched Uranium Materials Facility building. They unfurled banners, spray-painted the building with phrases such as “Woe to the empire of blood,” poured blood, prayed and broke bread.</p>
<p>Now they face felony charges that carry a maximum of $500,000 in fines and 15 years in prison. Additionally, in what looks like an attempt to scare them into pleading guilty now, federal prosecutors have mentioned bringing two heavier charges, including sabotage “during wartime,” which together carry up to 50 years imprisonmen</p>

<h1>Anti-nuke madness &amp; global warming</h1>

<div>Tuesday, November 27, 2012 &#8211; After the loss of 10 million American lives in the Three-Mile Island calamity in 1979, the death of 2 billion in the Chernobyl holocaust in 1986, and now the abandonment of all of northern Japan following the death of millions in last year’s Fukushima nuclear catastrophe, it is hardly surprising that the world’s biggest users of nuclear power are shutting their plants down.Oh, wait a minute. &#8230; This just in! Nobody died in the Three-Mile Island calamity; 28 plant workers were killed and 15 other people subsequently died of thyroid cancer in the Chernobyl holocaust; and nobody died in the Fukushima catastrophe. In fact, northern Japan has not been evacuated after all.They have already shut them down in Japan. All of the country’s 50 nuclear reactors were closed for safety checks after the tsunami damaged the Fukushima plant, and only two have reopened so far. The government, which was previously planning to increase nuclear’s share of the national energy mix to half by 2030, has now promised to close every nuclear power plant in Japan permanently by 2040. The new Japanese plan says that the country will replace the missing nuclear energy with an eightfold increase in renewable energy The truth is that as the Arctic sea ice melts and grain harvests are devastated by heat waves and drought, the world’s third-largest user of nuclear energy has decided to go back to emitting lots and lots of carbon dioxide.</p>

It is a video that shows the location of all the &#8220;known&#8221; nuclear bomb tests up to 1998. Now, that doesn&#8217;t mean ALL the tests because it does not show the Israeli test off South Africa nor does it include the Korean attempts. Still it is so much like a War Games screen and it is real. Also very well done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately I believe the answer is NO. Americans will never get serious about renewable energy until it is so far behind the rest of the world that it becomes embarrassed. By then it will be too late for us to take advantage of creating our own industries.</p>

<h2>How Germany Is Getting to 100 Percent Renewable Energy</h2>
<h6>Posted on Nov 15, 2012</h6>
<p><strong>By Thomas Hedges, Center for Study of Responsive Law</strong></p>
<p>There is no debate on climate change in Germany. The temperature for the past 10 months has been 3 degrees above average and we’re again on course for the warmest year on record. There’s no dispute among Germans as to whether this change is man-made, or that we contribute to it and need to stop accelerating the process.</p>
<p>Since 2000, Germany has converted 25 percent of its power grid to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and biomass. The architects of the clean energy movement <a href="http://www.bmu.de/english/transformation_of_the_energy_system/general_information/doc/48050.php">Energiewende,</a> which translates to “energy transformation,” estimate that from 80 percent to 100 percent of Germany’s electricity will come from renewable sources by 2050.</p>
<p>Germans are baffled that the United States has not taken the same path. Not only is the U.S. the wealthiest nation in the world, but it’s also credited with jump-starting Germany’s green movement 40 years ago.</p>
