										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems really weird that we all started out on bikes after horses and before cars were really affordable. There was a real love affair with bikes in the modern urban environment around the 1900s. Especially women who had never been allowed to get about. Bikes came on strong before mores or laws could be erected (so to speak) and women just went bonkers. Now every envirofreak (no offense intended) wants to go back to them. We shall see. We shall see.</p>

<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">HEIDELBERG, Germany — Eckart Würzner, a mayor on a mission to make his city emission free, is not terribly impressed by promises from <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/business/general-motors-electric-cars.html">General Motors</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/ford-says-it-will-phase-out-gasoline-powered-vehicles-in-europe.html">Ford</a> and other big automakers to swear off fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Not that Mr. Würzner, the mayor of Heidelberg, is against electric cars. The postcard-perfect city, in southern Germany, gives residents who buy a battery-powered vehicle a bonus of up to 1,000 euros, or $1,200. They get another €1,000 if they install a charging station.</p>
<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">But electric cars are low on the list of tools that Mr. Würzner is using to try to cut Heidelberg’s impact on the climate, an effort that has given the city, home to Germany’s oldest university and an 800-year-old castle ruin, a reputation as a pioneer in environmentally conscious urban planning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Families are starting to move into what is being called America&#8217;s first solar-powered town,&#8221; announces <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/sexual-misconduct/john-dickerson-replaces-charlie-rose-cbs-morning-n836096" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Dickerson</a> for CBS This Morning on Jan. 16. &#8220;<a href="https://www.babcockranch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Babcock Ranch</a>, about half an hour northeast of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Myers,_Florida" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fort Myers,</a> Florida, is supposed to produce more energy than it consumes once it&#8217;s finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>Developer <a href="http://kitsonpartners.com/executive-team/sydney-kitson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syd Kitson</a> is building 20,000 homes for a projected 50,000 people, states Dickerson in the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/inside-floridas-solar-powered-babcock-ranch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newscast video </a>accompanying the article.</p>
<blockquote><p>There are more than 300,000 solar panels spread across 440 acres there, producing enough electricity not only for the town, but also the surrounding areas, reports CBS News&#8217; <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/team/manuel-bojorquez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manuel Bojorquez</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>One critical energy element lacking in the solar-powered community will be adequate energy storage to allow the city to be truly self-powered:</p>
<blockquote><p>The town doesn&#8217;t run on solar power all the time. At night, when the sun is down, it has to draw from the traditional electrical grid. Kitson says the technology for storing all that surplus energy the solar cells generate during the day is still too costly.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.saveonenergy.com/kids-learning-center/saving-energy/">https://www.saveonenergy.com/kids-learning-center/saving-energy/</a></p>
<h2>A Ninja&#8217;s Quest to Save Energy</h2>
<p>Nico loves saving energy and natural resources and wants to share his knowledge with you! Join Nico and learn the best practices of saving energy.</p>
<p>dot dot dot Unfortunately the actual site is graphics heavy and I am no good at copying such things, but I am going to put up the Teacher Guide. I think you will get the idea. dot dot dot</p>
<p>The Kids’ Guide to Saving Energy is a useful resource to incorporate into your elementary classroom&#8217;s curriculum to help students understand the importance of saving energy. Have your students complete the guide during class or as an extra credit homework assignment. Discuss the guide in class and have your students present to the class ways they saved energy at home. Below are some suggestions on how to incorporate each page of the guide into your lesson plan:<br />
Page 2:<br />
SaveOnEnergy.com® created Nico as a fun way to teach students about energy. As your students connect with Nico, be sure to tell students to check out the other kids’ guides and continue to explore with Nico!<br />
Page 3:<br />
Ask students to volunteer to read aloud the reasons why conserving energy is important. Then, review the following discussion questions with your class.<br />
1. Do you think saving energy is important?<br />
1. What is energy conservation?<br />
2. What is energy efficiency?<br />
3. How do you think we can conserve energy in the classroom?<br />
Page 4:<br />
Have the students define renewable and nonrenewable energy. Then have the students place each renewable energy source under the proper category. If students are unfamiliar with certain energy sources, have them look up and define the words. Then, have your students brainstorm ways in which we can use renewable resources for energy and discuss the advantages of renewable energy.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>I also love that Nico is half of Nicodemus. Go there and read. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So after the Election we took three days off and went to Giant City State Park and drove over to see the Garden of the Gods. Giant City was disappointing:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=garden+of+the+gods&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a"> https://www.google.com/search?q=garden+of+the+gods&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a</a></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">With its breathtaking natural beauty and unlimited opportunities for outdoor recreation, a trip to Giant City State Park near Carbondale is sure to delight visitors of all ages. From camping and horseback riding to fishing and rappelling, it’s an outdoor lover’s paradise. Visitors will marvel at the many wilderness trails. Especially popular is a hike on Giant City Nature Trail, home of the “Giant City Streets” huge bluffs of sandstone formed 12,000 years ago .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Nestled in the Shawnee National Forest, just minutes south of Carbondale, the Union / Jackson county park was named for the unique impressions made by its massive sandstone structures. Eons of geological faulting and folding have molded a landscape like none other, which is now clothed in lush garments of fern, moss, large flowering mints, hundreds of species of wild flowers and 75-plus varieties of towering trees. The natural splendor of Giant City has made it a renowned retreat that attracts more than 1.2 million visitors annually.</span></p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>But Garden of the Gods was amazing:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.shawneeforest.com/Hiking/GardenoftheGods.aspx">http://www.shawneeforest.com/Hiking/GardenoftheGods.aspx</a></p>
<p>More than 320 million years ago, the wind and rain patiently started to chisel away at large deposits of sedimentary rock located in what is now, Shawnee National Forest . Over the years, the elements have sculpted some of the most stunning and extraordinary rock formations known to man. This garden of sandstone sculptures and vast untouched wilderness was fittingly named Garden of the Gods.</p>
<p>The park contains a variety of plant and animal life, adding to the scenic beauty of the Shawnee Forest. Garden of the Gods covers more than 3,300 acres of forest throughout the Southeastern Illinois counties of Saline, Pope and Hardin. There are also plenty of trails for backpacking and horseback riding, allowing nature lovers a welcome tour of what the lively environment has to offer.</p>

<p>Go there and be envious. More on Tuesday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First on the list of actual green active organizations is Greenpeace. As with most activist organizations, I like them or I hate them based on their actions. When they challenge the whalers, I applaud. When they unroll banners from bridges over the Mississippi River or chain themselves up in trees, I must admit I become embarrassed. I have never been a member needless to say.</p>

<h2>Happy whales have sanctuaries</h2>
<p><a href="http://greenpeaceblogs.org/2012/10/03/happy-whales-have-sanctuaries/"><img decoding="async" alt="" src="http://greenpeaceblogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GP049Q1-2.jpg" /></a><br />
My Greenpeace colleagues aboard the <em>Rainbow Warrior</em> in the Indian Ocean shared a heartwarming experience when a frolicking group of humpback and minke whales put on quite a show. It&#8217;s not a stretch to say these whales were happy and playful. Why wouldn&#8217;t they be as the entire Indian Ocean is a whale sanctuary where they can live in peace? What a contrast this is to other parts of the world where whales not only don&#8217;t have protections but face a myriad of direct threats from humans. One huge emerging threat to whales, dolphins and other marine wildlife is happening now in the coastal waters of California. <a href="http://greenpeaceblogs.org/2012/10/03/happy-whales-have-sanctuaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finding a design as cool as this is like finding a reason to live. Like being given a sack full of candy. It just lights up my life and gives me hope. Hope is a scarce commodity these days what with the drought and the drum beats for war against Iran. Still this is so cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670753/this-9-cardboard-bike-can-support-riders-up-to-485lbs">http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670753/this-9-cardboard-bike-can-support-riders-up-to-485lbs</a></p>
<h1>This $9 Cardboard Bike Can Support Riders Up To 485lbs</h1>
<h3><a title="Innovation By Design" href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/section/innovation-by-design"><em>Innovation By Design</em></a></h3>
<div>
<p>It’s 100% recycled and very lightweight, with a frame that’s stronger than carbon fiber.</p>
</div>
<p>Izhar Gafni has designed award winning industrial machines for  peeling pomegranates and sewing shoes. He’s also a bike enthusiast who’s  designed a lot of carbon fiber rigs. But one day, he’d heard about  someone who’d built a cardboard canoe. The idea drilled its way into his  consciousness, and ultimately, led him to create a cardboard bike  called the Alfa.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.erb.co.il/en/aboutus.asp?p=yxdn-vrjd-ufzg-ukyv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Alfa</a> weighs 20lbs, yet supports riders up to 24 times its weight. It’s  mostly cardboard and 100% recycled materials, yet uses a belt-driven  pedal system that makes it maintenance free. And, maybe best of all,  it’s project designed to be manufactured at about $9 to $12 per unit  (and just $5 for a kids version), making it not only one of the most  sustainable bikes you could imagine, but amongst the cheapest, depending  on the markup.</p>
<p>But as the above video documents, the design process was arduous.  Engineers told Gafni that his idea was impossible. Yet he realized that  paper could be strong if treated properly. As in crafting origami and  tearing telephone books, he explains, “[if] you fold it once, and it’s  not just twice the strength, it’s three times the strength.”</p>

<p>Transition Milwaukee (TM) is part of an international movement  formed, in part, in response to the peak oil crisis and more generally  around issues of climate change, economic security and permaculture  principles.</p>
<p>Peak oil is a non-controversial acknowledgement from government,  academic and industry experts that fossil fuels, a finite resource,  reach a peak moment of production and necessarily begin to decline.</p>
<p>Any controversy that peak oil generates is from determining when this  peak production will occur, from a few decades into the future to it  already peaking in 2007. Bigger questions about what a society that  can&#8217;t rely on fossil fuels looks like also stir up debate – and  emotions.</p>
<p>Permaculture principles are those that inform design and systems  theories about how to develop not only sustainable but self-maintained  and regenerative ecological systems. Modern agriculture and societies  based on oil consumption are not regarded as sustainable.</p>
<p>TM&#8217;s goals involve a &#8220;whole-systems&#8221; approach toward making our  economies sustainable and regenerative for seven generations into the  future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, Transition Milwaukee acts as a network of concerned  activists who are working toward reducing the radius in which we get our  goods and services, food, water and shelter,&#8221; says Jessica Cohodes, TM  steering committee leader, press contact and &#8220;big-picture synthesizer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Members of TM don&#8217;t really have official titles. Although it has a steering committee, TM is organized non-hierarchically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Transition Milwaukee has always been a group, grass-roots endeavor  about the community, from the ground up. Part of its founding philosophy  is that it isn&#8217;t someone else&#8217;s job to get us off oil, but our job,&#8221;  says Erik Lindberg, a former TM steering committee member who regularly  gives presentations on energy and the environment.</p>

<h1>Is Clean Energy Yet Another Culture War?</h1>

<p><em>David Roberts of Grist had a great post the other day portraying <a href="http://grist.org/politics/clean-energy-as-culture-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">clean energy as a culture war</a>. I think it’s highly worth a read, so I’m reposting it in full from Grist to make it easy as pie to not pass up (note: there’s also a Part II linked at the bottom of the post that is worth a read)</em>:</p>
<p>by David Roberts</p>
<p>Not that long ago, some folks were arguing that clean energy — unlike climate change, which had been irredeemably stained by <em>partisanship </em>(eww!) — would bring people together across ideological lines. Persuaded by the irrefutable wisdom of wonks, we would join hands across the aisle to promote common-sense solutions. It wouldn’t be partisan, it would be … post-partisan.</p>
<p>Some day, I will stop mocking the people who said that. But not today. The error is an important one and it is still made regularly, especially by hyper-educated U.S. elites. They think clean energy is different from climate change, that it won’t get sucked into the same culture war. They are wrong.</p>
<p>On clean energy, the material/financial aspects of the conflict are the easiest to understand. Wind, solar, and the rest threaten the financial dominance and political influence of dirty energy. Last week, the <em>Guardian</em> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/may/08/conservative-thinktanks-obama-energy-plans">broke the story</a> of a confidential memo laying out a plan to demonize and discredit clean energy, meant to coordinate the plans/messages of several big right-wing super PACs funded by dirty-energy money.</p>
<p>At the bottom of that same piece, though, is one of the best expressions I’ve ever seen of the cultural and psychological aspects of the conflict</p>

<h3><a rel="bookmark" href="http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/science/2012/04/10-things-weve-learned-about-the-earth-since-last-earth-day/">10 Things We’ve Learned About the Earth Since Last Earth Day</a></h3>
<p>Sunday is the 42nd celebration of Earth Day, which was started in  1970 by U.S. Senator Gaylord Nelson to help educate people about  environmental issues and demonstrate public support for a  conservationist agenda. With that in mind, we decided it was the right  time to recap the most surprising, awe-inspiring and alarming things  that we have learned about the Earth and the environment since last  year’s holiday:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Undiscovered species are still out there</strong>:  Countless discoveries over the past year reminded us that, despite  centuries of research, the planet still has plenty of surprise species  in store. Among the many finds include <a href="http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3158/2158-5520-2.1.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven new forest mice species</a> in the Philippines, a “psychedelic” gecko in Vietnam and <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0024047;jsessionid=8D89DE464A631B77E81BFD4C416F0F0D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new type of dolphin in Australia</a>. <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001127" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A new analysis released last August</a>, billed as the most accurate ever, estimated that a total of 8.7 million different species of life exist on earth.</p>
<p>2. <strong><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2011/05/04/science.1204531.abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Global warming is already driving up food prices</a></strong>:  While many fear that climate change will someday reduce crop yields and  cause food prices to rise, a study published last May in <em>Science</em> indicates that this troubling trend has already gotten started. The  models used suggest that reduced global yields of wheat and corn are  related to global warming. Although the effects are relatively small so  far, they may cause severe problems in the future, as climate patterns  continue to change and food demand increases.</p>
