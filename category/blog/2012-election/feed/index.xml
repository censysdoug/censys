										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The jackonapes in congress prattle on about how there is no Global Warming, and even if there is it ain&#8217;t man made. Those in the pocket of Big Coal want to find a way to make it cleaner. Like there is a way and America dithers on while China and India rush ahead. The song should go America the stupid with amber waves of insanity. Still at least the president has put something out there.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/06/obamas-climate-change-speech-three-words-less-coal-finally/66565/">http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/06/obamas-climate-change-speech-three-words-less-coal-finally/66565/</a></p>
<h1>Obama&#8217;s Climate Change Speech in Just Three Words: Less Coal, Finally</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="meta vcard"><span class="autor fn"><a title="Philip Bump" href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/authors/philip-bump/">Philip Bump</a> </span> <span class="pageviews">4,220 Views</span> <span class="date updated">9:20 AM ET</span></div>
<p>The process of climate change is complex and involves a vast array of contributors. But slowing climate change largely relies on one thing, cutting carbon dioxide emissions, and cutting carbon dioxide emissions heavily relies on reducing the use of coal. For all of the president&#8217;s intricate proposals during his speech on the topic of climate change today at Georgetown University, nothing is as important as his plan to reduce America&#8217;s use of coal.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to consider the president&#8217;s proposals within an economic context. As Senior Administration Officials<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> noted during a call on the topic last night, the president made a pledge to reduce carbon (dioxide) emissions in 2009 that the United States has made great progress in achieving. This is largely due to three things out of Obama&#8217;s control, however: the slow economy, a drop in electricity demand (in part due to the slow economy), and <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ffe4cd5a-dc14-11e2-a861-00144feab7de.html">the increased use of natural gas</a> for electricity production. Electricity production comes down to money, after all; if you figured out a way to generate gigawatts of power by leveraging the power of bare skin, America would be a nudist camp before sunset. We don&#8217;t love coal, we love that coal is cheap and is, by now, well-integrated into our power infrastructure.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s push to reduce coal use has two parts.</p>
<p><strong>Decrease domestic coal use by limiting carbon emissions at power plants.</strong> Again: This is the most important part of Obama&#8217;s speech, bar none. If he dropped everything else in his plan, this idea would still warrant a significant amount of attention, both here and abroad.</p>

<h1>Because Conservation Doesn&#8217;t Have a Party</h1>
<h2>By Audubon President &amp; CEO David Yarnold</h2>
<p>Published: Oct 16, 2012</p>
<div>New York NY &#8211;</div>
<p>You have to get out of shouting range of the politicians in Washington to appreciate what&#8217;s really important to Americans.  Americans like Barbra from Arizona: &#8220;&#8216;Environment&#8217; is not a swear word, but too often it is treated like one in the halls of our legislatures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barbra is one of thousands of Americans &#8212; Republicans, Democrats and independents &#8212; who have joined a national grassroots conversation aimed at taking the politics out of conservation and returning preservation of our wilderness land, waterways and wildlife to its original roots as a unifying, rather than divisive force in America.</p>
<p>Judging from responses from all across America, perhaps we are not a nation as divided as our political leaders would like us believe. We&#8217;ve heard from angry Republicans.  &#8220;Since when did breathing clean fresh air, drinking pure clean water and protecting our precious natural resources and environment become something that only Democrats should value?&#8221; wrote Lorrie from Pennsylvania.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This election offers a clear choice if you are into the environment and advancing energy policies towards a clean energy future. Barack wants to go to clean energy and Mitt wants to go back to the past. I have been disappointed in some of Barack&#8217;s decisions or should I say his administration&#8217;s decisions. I was totally unhappy with his decision to back the two nuclear power plants in Georgia. I also thought that the Sylendra loan was totally political. Still his strong backing for Wind and Solar is deeply appreciated. More historic however, he has moved the military towards alternative energy. Like I tell people who are you gonna vote for? The other guy?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.barackobama.com/record/environment?source=primary-nav">http://www.barackobama.com/record/environment?source=primary-nav</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>
<p><strong>President Obama has made protecting the environment a priority,</strong> moving us toward energy independence, investing in clean energy jobs, and taking steps to improve the quality of our air and water. As of November 2010, the Obama administration&#8217;s policies have helped create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the clean energy industry.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
<p><strong>President Obama enacted the largest expansion of land and water conservation and protected wilderness in a generation.</strong> He also created the America’s Great Outdoors initiative to develop a community-led conservation and recreation agenda for the 21st century.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>
<p><strong>President Obama is committed to putting in place an <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/energy-info">“all-of-the-above strategy”</a></strong> to develop every available source of American energy while making sure we never have to choose between protecting our environment and strengthening our economy.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In his most recent State of the Union address, President Obama reiterated his commitment to lessening America’s dependence on foreign oil and investing in clean energy to protect our environment and create jobs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>4 years ago at one point there were 17 candidates and I did something insane. I looked at all their energy policies. For over a half month I babbled on about &#8220;this, that or the other&#8221; white paper. Now as an older blogger, I did not even bother. What would be the difference between Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum&#8217;s energy policies. What, Newt wants to find energy on the moon his first year in office. And once it was all over, what is one to say about a guy that says he is for coal. But anyway, here is the Richie Rich&#8217;s energy policy proposals.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mittromney.com/issues/energy">http://www.mittromney.com/issues/energy</a></p>
<h2>Mitt&#8217;s Plan</h2>
<p>As president, Mitt Romney will make every effort to safeguard the environment, but he will be mindful at every step of also protecting the jobs of American workers. This will require putting conservative principles into action.</p>
<p><strong>Significant Regulatory Reform</strong></p>
<p>The first step will be a rational and streamlined approach to regulation, which would facilitate rapid progress in the development of our domestic reserves of oil and natural gas and allow for further investment in nuclear power.</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish fixed timetables for all resource development approvals</li>
<li>Create one-stop shop to streamline permitting process for approval of common activities</li>
<li>Implement fast-track procedures for companies with established safety records to conduct pre-approved activities in pre-approved areas</li>
<li>Ensure that environmental laws properly account for cost in regulatory process</li>
<li>Amend Clean Air Act to exclude carbon dioxide from its purview</li>
<li>Expand NRC capabilities for approval of additional nuclear reactor designs</li>
<li>Streamline NRC processes to ensure that licensing decisions for reactors on or adjacent to approved sites, using approved designs, are complete within two years</li>
</ul>
