										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every once in awhile I return to CES&#8217; residential roots. So, here is another pass. You know what I say in these situations &#8211; Buyer Beware. This site looks really really good. I think it is sexy that it is a nonprofit organization. But I have never used this organization. I am a homeowner who has made very little in the way of energy IMPROVEments &#8211; insulation, metal roof and efficient air conditioner but the furnace in my house is 20 years old. Nonetheless these people look cool.</p>
<p><a href="https://zeroenergyproject.org/our-mission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://zeroenergyproject.org/our-mission/</a></p>
<p><strong>The Zero Energy Project is a non-profit educational organization whose goal is to help home buyers, builders, designers, and real estate professionals take meaningful steps</strong> towards radically reducing carbon emissions and energy bills by building zero net energy homes and near zero energy homes. We envision the day when positive energy homes, which produce more energy than they consume, will power electric vehicles as well as homes, so that everyone can live well with less expense and without fear of energy price spikes, while greatly reducing our carbon emissions.</p>
<div id="" class="col-sm-12 full-standard nobg slate cover">

<div class="singlecolumn">
<h3>The mission of the Zero Energy Project is to provide information and education to prospective home buyers, builders, designers, real estate professionals and advocates about zero net energy homes and to advance the prevalence of these homes in the mainstream housing market. We seek to facilitate connections between industry professionals and buyers, remove perceived barriers to entry, and provide resources to people from all walks of life, empowering action towards a robust zero energy built environment.</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why? Because I am tired, pessimistic and it all seems so repetitive. I am also extremely disappointed. I am disappointed in myself, my friends, my State, my Nation, and hell even my enemies. WE HAD A CHANCE to stop this thing. We had the science and even the modeling on our side and yet we failed. We misjudged the power it would take and i think we totally misunderstood the violence it would take to stop the carbon industry from continuing to sell their products. We should have elected a President who wasopposed to fossil fuels 10 &#8211; 15 years ago. We should have blown up gas stations and power plants 10 &#8211; 15 years ago. Here we are looking at a 3 Degree uptick in temperature which will kill off all but the very hardy species. We act like there is still hope. We act like there is a future. Well I am done with that.</p>

<p data-elm-loc="1">A northeastern Siberian town is likely to have set a record for the highest temperature documented in the Arctic Circle, with a reading of 100.4 degrees (38 Celsius) recorded Saturday in Verkhoyansk, north of the Arctic Circle and about 3,000 miles east of Moscow. Records at that location have been kept since 1885.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="2">If verified, this would be the northernmost 100-degree reading ever observed, and the highest temperature on record in the Arctic, a region that is warming at more than twice the rate of the rest of the globe.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="3">On Sunday, the same location recorded a high temperature of 95.3 degrees (35.2 Celsius), showing the Saturday reading was not an anomaly. The average June high temperature in Verkhoyansk is just 68 degrees (20 Celsius).</p>

Sometimes the two meet in a happy medium. Then there are people who over do it. To those people I say stop. (no exclamation mark) Don&#8217;t be vegetarian to &#8220;save the planet&#8221;. It will not. Don&#8217;t have children to make the &#8220;world a better place&#8221;. It will not. Do those things if they make you feel good and you will have a better life. But if you want to have 3 kids- and you can love them and afford them,  then do that thing.</p>

<p id="hfRdc2">A growing contingent of young people are refusing to have kids — or are considering having fewer kids — because of climate change. Their voices have been growing louder over the past year. UK women set up a movement called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/12/birthstrikers-meet-the-women-who-refuse-to-have-children-until-climate-change-ends">BirthStrike</a>, announcing that they won’t procreate until the world gets its act together on climate, and high-profile US figures like <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/3/11/18256166/climate-change-having-kids">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> amplified the question of whether childbearing is still morally acceptable.</p>
<p id="WjhJHS">One of the main worries cited by this contingent is that having a child will make climate change worse. Their logic is that anytime you have a kid you’re doing something bad for the planet. You’re adding yet another person who’ll cause more carbon emissions, plus their children, plus their grandchildren &#8230; and so on, in a never-ending cascade of procreative shame.</p>
<p id="J8RdRy">Driving this logic are <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541">studies</a> claiming to show that having a child leads to a gargantuan amount of carbon emissions — way, way more than the emissions generated by other lifestyle choices, like driving a car or eating meat. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children">Media reports</a> have trumpeted the takeaway that if you want to fight climate change, having fewer children is far and away the best thing you can do.</p>
<p>But that’s just not true, according to <a href="https://founderspledge.com/stories/climate-and-lifestyle-report">a new report</a> by Founders Pledge, an organization that guides entrepreneurs committed to donating a portion of their proceeds to effective charities.</p>

<h2><strong>1. Magnetized Refrigerators</strong></h2>
<p>Research and development of new refrigeration technologies has helped to increase residential energy savings. It is estimated that refrigerators sold in the U.S. use about <a href="http://www.climatetechwiki.org/technology/fridges">60% less energy</a> today than they did twenty years ago. While the cost of an energy efficient refrigerator can be more expensive, in the long term, the cost to keep it running is much more cost effective than a less efficient model.</p>
<p>In order for companies to sell refrigerators that are eligible for energy savings, they must meet specific <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/files/specs//private/ENERGY%20STAR Final Version 5.0 Residential Refrigerators and Freezers Program Requirements.pdf">Energy Star program requirements</a>. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets the criteria for this program.</p>
<p>As part of the Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy?s funding program, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and General Electric have teamed up on a <a href="http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/downloads/magnetocaloric-refrigeration">magentocaloric refrigeration research and development project</a>. Their goal is to build a residential refrigerator that consumes <a href="http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/10/f18/emt50_momen_042414.pdf">25% less energy</a> than the current competition. Instead of using vapor compression, the team is using a technology known as the magnetocaloric effect (MCE). It?s a process where temperature is controlled by a changing magnetic field. This approach eliminates the use of</p>

So I drove out toward rt. 136 but I saw nothing. I got to researching it and here are the two stories I found. Check out the dates.</p>

<p>HAVANA — The Mason County Board took the first step Tuesday toward adopting an ordinance to regulate wind farms in unincorporated Mason County. With several proposed wind farms throughout the county, Mason will soon follow in the footsteps of other central Illinois communities and be host to the wind powered energy sources.The board did a first reading of the ordinance Tuesday, said City Clerk Bill Blessman. Adoption of the ordinance will be considered at the county board’s May meeting, he said. The main point in Tuesday’s reading, said Blessman, was to make the proposed ordinance available for public viewing.</p>
<p>The proposed ordinance sets forth various regulations for turbines and wind farms built in Mason County. According to the ordinance, 1,000-foot setbacks are required between towers and any primary structure, and all towers must be placed at least 1.1 times the tower’s height from public roads, transmission lines and communication towers.</p>

<p>Two different wind farm corporations have been securing leases in Mason County, according to county officials, who say the tax revenue a wind farm could bring would be welcome.</p>
<p>Mason County Board member James Miller said two wind energy companies have secured leases in Mason County, though the specifics of the companies’ plans are still unclear. The securing of leases is typically the first thing wind companies do before testing and, ultimately, obtaining the permits to erect the turbines. Overall, the process can take a few years.</p>
<p>However, when completed, the wind farms could prove a financial boon for the county which has lost population since the 2000 census — something that affects tax revenue for local governments in the county.</p>
<p>“The county would love to have (the wind farms), and for the school districts this is a big deal,” Miller said. “Some one or two or three of them would benefit.”</p>

<p>Please notice the last article was in 2011. 9 years later it is still &#8220;ongoing&#8221;/ At this rate they will put up the turbines when the prairie catches on fire.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I do not need to bemoan, because this is a real good thing, but BEMOAN I shall. Now that the feed backs loops have begun to kick in. They were only speculation before. And now that the plastic has begun to swamp the ocean and permeate our food chain. This maybe a little bit too late. Had we done this type of thing 30-40 years ago our species would not be in danger. Still it is a good step. But maybe it would be better off to just plant a trillion trees, to give us breathing space literally for this type of thing to catch up</p>

<p>This week, utility Southern California Edison selected a <a href="http://www3.sce.com/sscc/law/dis/dbattach5e.nsf/0/11D80C3CF6F46FEF882583E5000118BE/%24FILE/A1904XXX-PUBLIC%20SCE%20Testimony%20in%20Support%20of%20Appl%20for%20App%20of%20Results%20of%202018%20LCR%20RFP%20SCE-01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">roster of energy storage projects</a> to supply local capacity needs around the coastal city of Oxnard, instead of the 262-megawatt natural-gas peaker plant it had chosen previously.</p>
<p>If regulators give their approval, Strata Solar will build and own a 100-megawatt/400-megawatt-hour system in Oxnard, and dispatch it on behalf of SCE.</p>
<p>This system will tie for largest lithium-ion battery in the world when it comes online in December 2020; the <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/fluence-kicks-off-with-dedicated-financing-massive-supply-contract#gs.6s8e6k">AES Alamitos plant</a> of the same size is due around the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-9 article-content">
<p>SCE wants to complement the massive battery with a portfolio of smaller units, ranging from 10 to 40 megawatts, scattered around the area. Developers of those smaller include E.ON, Able Grid, Ormat, AltaGas and Enel. Swell, which aggregates fleets of home batteries into grid assets, won a 14-megawatt contract for behind-the-meter demand response.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I always try try to stay positive. This may have a chance. They will have to fight hard but it is their future. Not mine. I fought for 50 years. Now it is someone else&#8217;s turn. Good luck. God speed. Your only planet depends on it. We got no place else to go.</p>

<h1 class="c-page-title">The Green New Deal, explained</h1>
<h2 class="c-entry-summary p-dek">An insurgent movement is pushing Democrats to back an ambitious climate change solution.</h2>
<div class="c-byline">By <span class="c-byline__item"> <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/david-roberts">David Roberts</a><a class="c-byline__twitter-handle" href="https://www.twitter.com/drvox">@drvox</a><a title="" href="mailto:david@vox.com">david@vox.com</a> </span> <span class="c-byline__item"> Updated <time class="c-byline__item" datetime="2019-01-07T14:02:21+00:00" data-ui="timestamp"> Jan 7, 2019, 9:02am EST </time></span></div>
<p id="sDgYHm">If the recent <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/10/8/17948832/climate-change-global-warming-un-ipcc-report">report</a> from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is to be believed, humanity has just over a decade to get carbon emissions under control before catastrophic climate change impacts become unavoidable.</p>
<p id="aPnLpx">The Republican Party generally ignores or denies that problem. But the Democratic Party claims to accept and understand it.</p>
<p id="BzJYTN">It is odd, then, that Democrats <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/11/there-is-no-democratic-plan-to-fight-climate-change/543981/">do not have a plan to address climate change</a>.</p>
<p id="VWNRRQ">Their last big plan — the American Clean Energy and Security Act — passed the House in 2009 but went on to die an unceremonious death before reaching the Senate floor. Since then, there’s been nothing to replace it.</p>
<p id="ASAlPz">Plenty of Democratic politicians support policies that would reduce climate pollution — renewable energy tax credits, fuel economy standards, and the like — but those policies do not add up to a comprehensive solution, certainly nothing like what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggests is necessary.</p>
<p id="SDT6KP">Young activists, who will be forced to live with the ravages of climate change, find this upsetting. So they have proposed a plan of their own. It’s called the Green New Deal (GND) — a term purposefully reminiscent of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s original New Deal in the 1930s — and it has become the talk of the town. Here are Google searches from the past few months:</p>

<p class="content__segment combx">Duke Energy Corp. expects to spend $500 million over the next 15 years installing more than 300 megawatts worth of storage batteries on its Carolinas grid.</p>
<p class="content__segment combx">Charlotte-based Duke (NYSE: DUK) released the estimate Wednesday morning, days after <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/news/2018/10/09/duke-energy-proposes-solar-plus-storage-project.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposing its first microgrid project </a>— including a two-megawatt solar farm and a four-megawatt storage battery — for residential and business customers. That will serve the remote mountain town of Hot Springs, on the North Carolina-Tennessee border north of Asheville.</p>
<p class="content__segment combx">Duke says it plans to expand the use of batteries beyond storing and dispatching of energy. Its long-range plan includes deploying batteries for other purposes such as system balancing, increasing reliability of “end of the line” power supplies and to defer other traditional grid upgrades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the years I have gotten 100s of requests to post links with other Blogs and Internet Sites that are related to the things that I post about; Sometimes tangentially. Sometimes very tangentially. Below I am going to try to post some of those with the text of the request where applicable or sometimes just the link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am only one guy by the way. That is it, Community Energy Systems and Energy Tough Love is just one guy with 900 bucks in the bank&#8230;.so there is no way I can track down each post of mine and put the link on the page. Did I mention I was 63 years old. I would be dead by the time i did 10 or 20 post. Is some of this sarcastic? Well yah. But I never mean it spitefully. Please laugh with me not at me. Consider this:</p>
<p>Hello ,</p>
<p>My name is James Giraldo and I’m the Communications Manager on SaveOnEnergy.com®.</p>
<p>I wanted to point out this page: <a href="/censys/?m=200810" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">censys.org</a> which links to a broken kids energy page on <a href="http://www.miamisci.org/af/sln/frankenstein/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">miamisci.org</a></p>
<p>Our team has created a <a href="https://www.saveonenergy.com/kids-learning-center/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kids Learning Center</a> which is filled with free resources similar to the ones previously found on that page. Please take a look, and if you find any of the content useful consider linking to it on your page, or perhaps use it to replace the broken link so your visitors don&#8217;t end up on that broken page.</p>
<p>Here is a hyperlink to our kids learning center:<br />
<a href="https://www.saveonenergy.com/kids-learning-center/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.saveonenergy.com/kids-learning-center/</a></p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your help and attention. Please let me know if you have questions or concerns that I can assist with.</p>
<p>James G.<br />
Communications Director<br />

<p>Or this:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Hi censys.org,</span></p>
<p>I was reading a page on your site and I noticed you had link pointing to a page that is broken (no longer valid) which I thought you might want to fix.</p>
<p>The broken link can be found at the middle of the page.  The page that has the broken link is:</p>
<p><a href="/censys/index.php?s=energy&amp;paged=27" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">/censys/index.php?s=energy&amp;paged=27</a></p>
<p>Attached is a screenshot with a circle around the broken link to make it easier to find.</p>
<p>Having broken links on your site isn’t good for your readers and also Google lowers your ranking score if you have them.  It would be awesome if you could replace the broken link with one of our related posts instead, if not, that is okay.</p>
<p><span class="u_b en_0 C4_Z2aVTcY" data-test-id="message-from"><span class="D_F rtlI_rtlI_dz_sSg "><span class="u_N C_Z1VRpVF"><a href="http:www.businesselectric.com">http:www.businesselectric.com</a></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
If you would replace it with our link we would share the post with 14,000+ followers in our niche.  We are up for collaborating more with you or negotiating more about it.</span></p>
<p>Thanks for reading my email and have a nice day ?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Oliver</p>
