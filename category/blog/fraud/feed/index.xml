										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me very quickly say, that I wish no immediate harm to the simpering moron (sigh). I am not urging anybody anywhere to do any harm to the coal toad.  All I am say is that after he dies of Black Lung, I hope bad things happen to him.</p>
<p>He is not even a Democrat. He is a DINO: Democrat In Name Only. He knows the majority is thin and thus his power is great. So behind the flag of Fiscal Responsibility he argues for a smaller bill. A Bill that can &#8220;get paid for&#8221;. What gets dropped out of that smaller bill? Surprise! Surprise! The Climate Change program that his coal sucking buddies hate. I mean this is from Vanity Fair for God&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p class="has-dropcap">Although <strong>Joe Manchin</strong> has been holding up <strong>Joe Biden</strong>’s infrastructure plans for a while now over the price tag, the West Virginia senator has been somewhat cagey about his actual demands. Not as guarded, perhaps, as <strong>Kyrsten Sinema</strong>, his fellow Democratic holdout; where she has <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/09/what-exactly-does-kyrsten-sinema-want">refused</a> to state her terms to anyone outside the White House, Manchin at least engages with his colleagues and speaks publicly about his objections to the reconciliation bill. But he’s been difficult to pin down nonetheless, adding to the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/nancy-pelosi-democrats-infrastructure-deal">frustrations</a> of Democrats as they seek to deliver on the centerpiece of Biden’s domestic agenda.</p>
<p>Finally, while his terms are coming into clearer view, they’re only casting the future of the infrastructure bills in a thicker cloud of uncertainty. Now, the question isn’t only if the Biden bills will pass. It’s whether the bills will be recognizable if they do. Axios on Sunday <a class="external-link" href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-manchins-red-lines-f9f5f7f7-56d8-4bf6-8345-13abb75ef03f.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=editorial&amp;utm_content=politics-childtaxcredit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://www.axios.com/scoop-manchins-red-lines-f9f5f7f7-56d8-4bf6-8345-13abb75ef03f.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=editorial&amp;utm_content=politics-childtaxcredit" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.axios.com/scoop-manchins-red-lines-f9f5f7f7-56d8-4bf6-8345-13abb75ef03f.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=editorial&amp;utm_content=politics-childtaxcredit&quot;}">reported</a> that Manchin has given something of an ultimatum to the White House: He’ll support the child tax credit that would be one of the package’s biggest boosts to working families, but only if it&#8230;well, does less to help working families. Manchin is asking for the credit to include a work requirement and an income cap that would make families earning more than $60,000 ineligible for assistance—a demand that would weaken a key part of the spending bill. He is also, as Axios reported, continuing to rail against provisions of the reconciliation bill that are crucial to addressing climate change, <a class="external-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/climate/manchin-climate-biden.html?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20211017&amp;instance_id=43090&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;regi_id=56298477&amp;segment_id=71906&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=2abb12c11b787f32a2358bbfc4aeefd0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/climate/manchin-climate-biden.html?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20211017&amp;instance_id=43090&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;regi_id=56298477&amp;segment_id=71906&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=2abb12c11b787f32a2358bbfc4aeefd0" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/climate/manchin-climate-biden.html?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20211017&amp;instance_id=43090&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;regi_id=56298477&amp;segment_id=71906&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=2abb12c11b787f32a2358bbfc4aeefd0&quot;}">supposedly</a> because of concerns that the shift to clean energy the Biden plan would help usher in could cost jobs in the coal state of West Virginia.

<p><strong>What is This Device?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s called ÖkoWatt and its tech was originally created by no other than the legendary Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist, Nikola Tesla.</p>
<p>Initially it was concealed from the general public because it offered average families the opportunity to save on their monthly energy costs. <a href="http://track.roinattrack.com/click?cep=2iSzLCQN0QDlUE_kc09NvGhBKa4V9Ds1f1yyex-Z58wWB_8RM5YwHXsOKH9NWUtbuCUSEMRKHQ_0RlDGcUpFlJzGXzi4Q_p74VT-SWA2Q0i-Amg8DFsYirLyDONBCYYGMTX9V7TsDuuIZkSVuIL76ySCYwsuwsEUjTcMDlbbd79ETiuYdHHt5oGNQdr1l1eN7JPAsD9viwI-kdqmdTQvkbPd9bdjXInYoegmhpYVBIUXGEESFgLUY8_CvXOPm9Clow1QlJnEaHOjY_GdeJgzp5p53t2mhHj-vj1kxXzkn49xdzLAV9y76nAZJmRS3uV_nv_UPspIgPLK2NkkliRU4r8uXeozX-1H8ZniVXk_djgY91el84Pbh34N5ozleyRYFKReOdCJ-RDKkHh0ExgHan4LjC9L7uL56NKlOIASPj_sC4R9vbQtBfpCO51NEXXA5XZ8yx2ibfxptiiJ9r4pL9Gas3GK5szYiYN8yVYXopT4LgI9MXdJ2xGppP2wnfHhysBeE3FMbR4NJL1HDz8tfQ&amp;lptoken=154f8257813173a793f7&amp;adversion_id=4238759&amp;ad_id=369037&amp;budget_id=206702&amp;adcampaign_id=150894&amp;publication_id=2853&amp;headline_id=1322572&amp;content_id=279679&amp;previewimage_id=333544&amp;device=desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ÖkoWatt is a small, compact, affordable, and easy-to-use plug-in unit</strong></a><strong> </strong>that stops unnecessary power from entering the electrical cables and overloading the network.</p>
<p>ÖkoWatt is your power company&#8217;s worst nightmare. They have been trying to hide ÖkoWatt from the everyday consumer and have even banned it in retail shops.</p>
<p>Big Energy is threatened by this device and its potential to cut into profits.</p>
<p>However, thanks to the Internet, the secret is out, and everyday people are now reaping the rewards of less power consumption overall, <strong><em>as well as that used by household appliances.</em></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past 12 years I have never posted an entire work. That is kind of the point here. To get you to go to other sites and read. Maybe on your own to go to another link to expand your world or you knowledge base. But Greta said it so well and what she said is so important that I am going to put it all up here. I am going to put up a link so NBC gets credit but there isn&#8217;t anything extra there.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/read-greta-thunberg-s-full-speech-united-nations-climate-action-n1057861">https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/read-greta-thunberg-s-full-speech-united-nations-climate-action-n1057861</a></p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">My message is that we&#8217;ll be watching you.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">This is all wrong. I shouldn&#8217;t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet, you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you!</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words and yet I&#8217;m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">For more than 30 years, the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you&#8217;re doing enough when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency, but no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not want to believe that. Because if you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act then you would be evil and that I refuse to believe.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50 percent chance of staying below 1.5 degrees and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">Fifty percent may be acceptable to you, but those numbers do not include tipping points, most feedback loops, additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution or the aspects of equity and climate justice.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">They also rely on my generation sucking hundreds of billions of tons of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">So a 50 percent risk is simply not acceptable to us, we who have to live with the consequences.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">How dare you pretend that this can be solved with just business as usual and some technical solutions? With today&#8217;s emissions levels, that remaining CO2 budget will be entirely gone within less than eight and a half years.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures here today, because these numbers are too uncomfortable and you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">You are failing us, but the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you and if you choose to fail us, I say: We will never forgive you.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up and change is coming, whether you like it or not.</p>

<p>Unusually hot and dry conditions in parts of the northern hemisphere have been conducive to fires raging from the Mediterranean to – in particular – the Arctic. Climate change, with rising temperatures and shifts in precipitation patterns, is amplifying the risk of wildfires and prolonging the season.</p>
<p>WMO’s Global Atmosphere Watch Programme has released a <a href="http://https://youtu.be/ZfJsedQlio0">short animation</a> which highlights the risks and explains how advances in satellite technology make it possible to detect and monitor fire dangers. Improving forecasting systems is important for predictions and warnings around fire danger and related air pollution hazards.</p>
<p>In addition to the direct threat from burning, wildfires also release harmful pollutants including particulate matter and toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and non-methane organic compounds into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Particles and gases from burning biomass can be carried over long distances, affecting air quality in regions far away.</p>

<h1 class="title">Putting On The Brakes: Transportation Department Rolls Back Oil Train Regulation</h1>
<div class="datepublished">October 24, 2018</div>
<div class="btn-group">Madelyn Beck</div>
<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation <a href="https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/news/phmsa-rescinds-ecp-brake-mandate-after-ria-finds-costs-outweigh-benefits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has removed</a> a regulation meant to force trains carrying crude oil or other flammable liquids to adopt electronic braking technology by 2020. Electronically Controlled Pneumatic brakes — or ECP brakes — are meant to stop train cars and keep them from slamming into each other when a train derails.</p>
<p>Illinois is both a train hub and an oil train hub, and the regulatory change will have several effects in the state.</p>
<p>One is cost savings to the railroad industry. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, “the expected costs of requiring ECP brakes would be significantly higher than the expected benefits of the requirement.”</p>
<p>It would cost the industry between $375 and $554 million to install the braking systems in the next four to five years, hundreds of millions more than it would save in damages, according to the department. That’s an update from when this was first calculated under the Obama administration, which found that the benefits may outweigh costs. The change can partially be explained by reduced oil train traffic in general due to pipelines and lower oil prices between 2015 and 2017. Fewer trains means fewer potential accidents and damages.</p>

<p><em>Updated Aug. 14 with a judge dismissing one of the state-level children&#8217;s climate lawsuits, in Washington.</em></p>
<p>A wave of legal challenges that is washing over the oil and gas industry, demanding accountability for climate change, started as a ripple after revelations that ExxonMobil had long recognized the threat fossil fuels pose to the world.</p>
<p>Over the past few years: Two states have launched fraud investigations into Exxon over climate change. Nine cities and counties, from New York to San Francisco, have sued major fossil fuel companies, seeking compensation for <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/topic/climate-change">climate change</a> damages. And determined children have filed lawsuits against the federal government and various state governments, claiming the governments have an obligation to safeguard the environment.</p>
<p>The litigation, reinforced by science, has the potential to reshape the way the world thinks about energy production and the consequences of global warming. It advocates a shift from fossil fuels to sustainable energy and draws attention to the vulnerability of coastal communities and infrastructure to extreme weather and sea level rise.</p>
<p>From a trove of internal Exxon documents, a narrative emerged in 2015 that put a spotlight on the conduct of the fossil fuel industry. An <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/content/Exxon-The-Road-Not-Taken">investigative series of stories by InsideClimate News</a>, and later <a href="http://graphics.latimes.com/exxon-arctic/">the Los Angeles Times</a>, disclosed that the oil company understood the science of global warming, predicted its catastrophic consequences, and then spent millions to promote misinformation.</p>

<p>Southern Co. will absorb $1.1 billion in additional pre-tax costs for its Plant Vogtle nuclear expansion project, the company said in financial disclosures early today.</p>
<p>The costs include $700 million in additional subcontractor costs and an additional construction contingency estimate for nuclear reactors, which Southern&#8217;s Georgia Power Co. unit is building with a group of public power companies.</p>
<p>Georgia Power recorded the pre-tax charge of $1.1 billion, or $800 million after taxes, for the quarter, ending June 30.</p>
<p>Atlanta-based Southern released the information shortly after 6 a.m. as part of its quarterly report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s decision to eat millions of dollars in costs associated with a large power plant is a bitter reminder to investors of its next-generation coal project in Mississippi. Southern took back-to-back quarterly losses amounting to billions of dollars with the Kemper County energy facility because of a settlement with Mississippi utility regulators.</p>
<p>Unlike Kemper, Southern does not own the technology associated with Vogtle. This is also the first year that the company&#8217;s nuclear unit and Georgia Power are fully in control of the project.</p>
<p>This means the utilities can no longer point fingers at others if there are problems.</p>

<p>Go there and read a really long articel. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All the capitalists care about is the money. So what if somebody dies making the power? So what if making the power kills someone? As long as they get their 100,000K profit or whatever it is. The numbers really have to mount before they even notice.

<p>New plans to build two commercial <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-the-offshore-wind-industry-is-about-to-take-off-95997" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offshore wind farms</a> near the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> and <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rhode-island">Rhode Island</a> coasts have sparked a lot of <a href="http://capeandislands.org/post/vineyard-wind-hears-public-concerns#stream/0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussion</a> about the <a href="https://www.boem.gov/Offshore-Wind-Energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vast potential of this previously untapped source of electricity</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="Raw-s1p4r1tl-0 jioFUO">
<p>But as <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_h0VdMkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an environmental health and climate researcher</a>, I&#8217;m intrigued by how this gust of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/11/7/074019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offshore wind power</a> may improve <a href="https://www.usnews.com/topics/subjects/public_health">public health</a>. Replacing fossil fuels with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2771" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wind and solar energy</a>, research shows, can <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce risks of asthma, hospitalizations and heart attacks</a>. In turn, that can save lives.</p>
</div>
<div class="Raw-s1p4r1tl-0 jioFUO">
<p>So my colleagues and I calculated the health impact of generating electricity through <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/5/25/17393156/offshore-wind-us-massachusetts-rhode-island-zinke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offshore wind turbines</a> – which until now the U.S. has barely begun to do.</p>

<p>New England gets almost none of its electricity from burning coal and more than three-quarters of it from burning <a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/about/key-stats/resource-mix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural gas and operating nuclear reactors</a>. The rest is from hydropower and from renewable energy, including wind and solar power and the burning of wood and refuse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In other words they try to get out of their obligations by appearing to be generous. No Nuke has been built in the U.S. in 40 years because they are financial death traps. It takes a &#8220;modernizing&#8221; economy to support such a massive waste of time and money. And of course ignore safety concerns when regulation is lax. Now they want to give away a partially built plant. What the hell is North Carolina gonna do with that?</p>

<p>COLUMBIA — The parent company of South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co. is offering the site of a failed nuclear reactor project to the state-owned utility Santee Cooper.</p>
<p>SCANA has proposed giving the Fairfield County site to Santee Cooper so the project could be preserved and perhaps finished at some point in the future, The State newspaper reported.</p>
<p>SCE&amp;G and Santee Cooper abandoned their joint effort July 31 after spending more than $9 billion, both blaming the failure on the bankruptcy by principal contractor Westinghouse. SCE&amp;G customers have been charged nearly $2 billion toward interest on the company&#8217;s debt, via a series of rate hikes since 2009, without any power being generated.</p>
