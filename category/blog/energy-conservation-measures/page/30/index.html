			<p>For 3 generations now, environmental stewardship has been taught in the k-12 school systems of many countries. The change it will bring is only now a wave but soon it will be a tidal wave:</p>

<p>One of our major projects for this year was our penny drive for the World Wildlife Fund. This program was called &#8220;Pennies for the Planet&#8221;. Over five weeks, we were able to raise $759.29 in pennies. It took a lot of time and dedication to count all of the pennies. On average, about five students every lunch hour would count pennies by hand. This took approximately a month. All together, that´s close to 76 000 pennies! We used the money to adopt a Panda bear, an owl, an Orca, a Sea turtle, an Asian elephant, a Polar bear, part of the boreal forest, the Arctic and the oceans </p>
<p>Another project that we´ve been working on this year is our Peace Garden. We worked very hard to clear it of trash and weeds and planted new flowers and plants. We also raised awareness about global warming and littering. One of our environment club members gave a speech about global warming this year and another member is part of a news crew that makes announcements once or twice a month about littering.</p>
<p>To help get the message out, we made posters about different environmental issues. Some of the issues were anti-idling, composting and waste reduction. To help encourage the use of composters, we were able to purchase a compost bin for our cafeteria</p>

			<p>In a post in-or-around May 28th I said that the Airforce was preparing to switch to a synthetic fuel made from coal. I said if done properly that it might not be a bad thing environmentally premised on the fact that the Death Comes From Above crowd was going to fly and going to kill no matter what. I mean it&#8217;s hard enough to sell a noncarbon economy without trying to argue for peace and harmony. I am for all of the above, but the Corporate Capitalists are never going to buy peace and harmony &#8211; it&#8217;s just not their thing. There is nothing good about flying from a global warming point of view. But that is for another post.</p>
<p><a href="http://gasification-igcc.blogspot.com/">http://gasification-igcc.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>Anyway in that post I repeatedly and obnoxiously referred to the process as gasification and it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s an entirely different process process using entirely different reagents and at entirely different temperatures. The proper term for that is Coal To Liquids Process(ing)(es) and Harry pointed it out to me. I am soooooo sorry. It has been corrected. I shall never do it again.</p>

<p class="blogbody"><span class="title"><strong>First US Coal To Liquid Plant Coming</strong></span>The <em>New York Times</em> reports on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/05/business/05coalfuel.html?th&amp;emc=th"><strong><span style="color: #0000aa;">plans by Rentech to build a plant to convert coal to liquid fuel burnable in diesel engines.</span></strong></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here in East Dubuque, <a href="http://www.rentechinc.com/"><strong><span style="color: #0000aa;">Rentech Inc.</span></strong></a>, a research-and-development company based in Denver, recently bought a plant that has been turning natural gas into fertilizer for forty years. Rentech sees a clear opportunity to do something different because natural gas prices have risen so high. In an important test case for those in the industry, it will take a plunge and revive a technology that exploits America&#8217;s cheap, abundant coal and converts it to expensive truck fuel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Otherwise, I don&#8217;t see us having a future,&#8221; John H. Diesch, the manager of the plant, said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a large scaling up of coal-to-liquid (CTL) production takes place then an increase in pollution seems likely. Though perhaps advances in conversion technologies and tougher regulations could prevent this. The use of coal to make liquid fuels will increase CO2 emissions since the conversion plants will emit CO2 and of course the liquid fuel will emit CO2 just as conventional diesel fuel does. Those who view rising CO2 emissions with alarm therefore see a shift to CTL as a harmful trend.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And, uniquely in this country, the plant will take coal and produce diesel fuel, which sells for more than $100 a barrel.</p>
<p>The cost to convert the coal is $25 a barrel, the company says, a price that oil seems unlikely to fall to in the near future. So Rentech is discussing a second plant in Natchez, Miss., and participating in a third proposed project in Carbon County in Wyoming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds very profitable. The longer the price of oil stays high the likelier that capitalists will decide it is worth the risk to build CTL plants. Many are holding back worried that oil prices could tank again as happened in the early 1980s. That price decline drove the <a href="http://www.futurepundit.com/mt/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=3199"><strong><span style="color: #0000aa;">Beulah North Dakota Great Plains Synfuels Plant</span></strong></a> into bankruptcy. Though it was restarted and now produces natural gas from coal profitably. Though the bankruptcy cut the capital cost of operating that plant and so is not a perfect measure of the profitability of processes to convert coal to gas or liquid.<br>
:}</p>
<p>Thanks Harry!</p>

<h1 style="margin: 0px" class="articleTitle">Wind ($23.37) v. Gas (25 Cents)<br>
<span class="aTime"><em><font size="2" color="#666666">May 12, 2008; Page A14</font></em></span>
</h1>
<p class="times">Congress seems ready to spend billions on a new &#8220;Manhattan Project&#8221; for green energy, or at least the political class really, really likes talking about one. But maybe we should look at what our energy subsidy dollars are buying now.</p>
<p class="times">Some clarity comes from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), an independent federal agency that tried to quantify government spending on energy production in 2007. The agency reports that the total taxpayer bill was $16.6 billion in direct subsidies, tax breaks, loan guarantees and the like. That&#8217;s double in real dollars from eight years earlier, as you&#8217;d expect given all the money Congress is throwing at &#8220;renewables.&#8221; Even more subsidies are set to pass this year.</p>
<p class="times">An even better way to tell the story is by how much taxpayer money is dispensed per unit of energy, so the costs are standardized. For electricity generation, the EIA concludes that solar energy is subsidized to the tune of $24.34 per megawatt hour, wind $23.37 and &#8220;clean coal&#8221; $29.81. By contrast, normal coal receives 44 cents, natural gas a mere quarter, hydroelectric about 67 cents and nuclear power $1.59.</p>
<p class="times">The wind and solar lobbies are currently moaning that they don&#8217;t get their fair share of the subsidy pie. They also argue that subsidies per unit of energy are always higher at an early stage of development, before innovation makes large-scale production possible. But wind and solar have been on the subsidy take for years, and they still account for less than 1% of total net electricity generation. Would it make any difference if the federal subsidy for wind were $50 per megawatt hour, or even $100? Almost certainly not without a technological breakthrough.</p>
<p class="times">By contrast, nuclear power provides 20% of U.S. base electricity production, yet it is subsidized about 15 times less than wind. We prefer an energy policy that lets markets determine which energy source dominates. But if you believe in subsidies, then nuclear power gets a lot more power for the buck than other &#8220;alternatives.&#8221;</p>
<p class="times">The same study also looked at federal subsidies for non-electrical energy production, such as for fuel. It found that ethanol and biofuels receive $5.72 per British thermal unit of energy produced. That compares to $2.82 for solar and $1.35 for refined coal, but only three cents per BTU for natural gas and other petroleum liquids.</p>
<p class="times">All of this shows that there is a reason fossil fuels continue to dominate American energy production: They are extremely cost-effective. That&#8217;s a reality to keep in mind the next time you hear a politician talk about creating millions of &#8220;green jobs.&#8221; Those jobs won&#8217;t come cheap, and you&#8217;ll be paying for them.</p>

			<p>People have been brainwashed to believe that our world will come to a crashing end without oil. The Peak Oil people in particular have a saying &#8220;back to the olduvai valley&#8221; because they believe that our civilization will crumble like the Egyptions, Greeks and other GREAT civilizations. Olduvai was the valley where they found the homonid Lucy&#8217;s bones.</p>
<p>Admittedly some of those societal &#8220;downs&#8221; caused famine and pestilence, but in others it merely led to lots of people going back to farming. As silly as it may sound, you can generate electricity with a bicycle and charge a battery to run a computer. Us modern humans have run on excess energy  for so long it might not hurt us or the planet to take a break and set some priorities.</p>
<p>So anyway from where I live in Riverton IL in the USA, I would just go back to farming and let a few yard birds run. Others are not so lucky. I have said with no malice or cruelty that a lot of people are going to die. But I think we will do what humanity has done for 1000&#8217;s of years&#8230;we hang together.</p>

<h2 id="article-header-h2">Farming without fossils</h2>
<p>In a world on the cusp of fuel shortages, one enterprising collection of British farmers have come up with a solution they claim is practical, profitable – and close to home. They’re growing their own. <strong>Trevor Lawson</strong> reports</p>
<p>Barton reckons that the Goodwood estate’s tenant farmers could produce enough biofuel to supply the estate and themselves, and still have a surplus for sale. The key, he argues, is keep it local. “There’s no point in producing seed here, sending it miles for processing and then bringing the fuel all the way back. It’s too inefficient.” So Barton is looking at a combined rape press and refinery system that will produce 2,000 litres of fuel an hour, round the clock, for as long as there is rape seed to supply it. He’s also got plans for the pressed ‘cake’ that’s left over. “You can make it into dense briquettes for a superb solid fuel, burning more slowly than wood but at a higher temperature. So it can be used to feed boilers to generate heat and electricity.” Barton’s logic seems inescapable, and it’s finding allies in Whitehall, too. Nick Cooper manages the Farming Without Fossil Fuels project at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>

<p><strong>Peak Oil: the threat to our food security<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Peak oil refers to the point when the maximum amount of oil that can be extracted globally is reached. Thereafter, production will tail off as remaining reserves become more difficult and more expensive to harvest. Many of the services that we currently take for granted &#8211; cheap flights, cheap imports and global distribution of food &#8211; will be radically curtailed.<br>
 One of the greatest impacts will be on how and where our food is produced. The dominant models of intensive agriculture and the global food trade depend on vast inputs of oil. In a post peak oil world, the combination of higher transport costs, climate change and increased conflict will necessitate us all relying far more on re-localised food supplies. Even though it requires far lower amounts of oil, organic farming is not exempt from the need to adapt.</p>
<p>You can find out more in our information sheets on <a href="http://www.peakoil.com/">peak oil</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_and_agriculture">climate change and agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>Over the last 20 years, the Soil Association has established organic farming as the most sustainable method of production and helped grow a burgeoning market for organic food. Now we must refine our focus if we are to adapt to the changing external circumstances which will touch all our lives very soon. The phrase that comes to mind is that we are &#8216;building the ark of sustainable agriculture&#8217; for the new era ahead.</p>
<p>The challenge is immediate, but fear should not be the driver. The Soil Association is optimistic that we have the vision and means to create a new, localised food culture that will deliver long-term quality of life in place of the old dynamic of unrestrained globalisation and short-termist exploitation.</p>

It suggests that the concept of Energy Descent Plans could be applied to food and farming in the UK, an idea that will be explored in more depth in the report. Here is the article followed by some additions from within the Soil Association.<span id="more-564"></span></p>
<p><strong>Energy scarcity is an opportunity for a better world, says Rob Hopkins</strong></p>
<p>I used to think that one day the world would literally run out of oil. A driver in Leicestershire would use the last drop and that would be that, similar to the felling of the last Truffula Tree in Dr Seuss’s The Lorax. It turns out that scarcity kicks in earlier than that. It’s not the last drop that is the problem but the mid-point of production, when all the oil that is easy and cheap to extract has been used up. It looks as if we are reaching that point soon.</p>

<p>Where folks have &#8220;farmable&#8221; or &#8220;growable&#8221; land, all of us will have to plant Victory Gardens and raise rabbits and chickens. We will have to buy and sell local. For those that do not&#8230; well that is something we all should be planning for now. There are probably 2 billion people in harms way. What about the economy? Well what about it? Aren&#8217;t WE the economy. Money may be worrthless&#8230;but so what. That is only gona matter to people that gots a lot of it.</p>

			<p>Let&#8217;s look at the food and energy issue another way. I spend most of my time talking to people about how to use less energy in their homes. But, according to Dale Allen Phieffer I can save much more on food than in my house or my car.</p>

<blockquote><p>The secret of great wealth with no obvious source is some forgotten crime, forgotten because it was done neatly.—Balzac</p></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The journalist&#8217;s rule says: follow the money. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This rule, however, is not really axiomatic but derivative, in that money, as even our vice president will tell you, is really a way of tracking energy. We&#8217;ll follow the energy.</font><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We learn as children that there is no free lunch, that you don&#8217;t get something from nothing, that what goes up must come down, and so on. The scientific version of these verities is only slightly more complex. As James Prescott Joule discovered in the nineteenth century, there is only so much energy. You can change it from motion to heat, from heat to light, but there will never be more of it and there will never be less of it. The conservation of energy is not an option, it is a fact. This is the first law of thermodynamics.</font><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Special as we humans are, we get no exemptions from the rules. All animals eat plants or eat animals that eat plants. This is the food chain, and pulling it is the unique ability of plants to turn sunlight into stored energy in the form of carbohydrates, the basic fuel of all animals. Solar-powered photosynthesis is the only way to make this fuel. There is no alternative to plant energy, just as there is no alternative to oxygen. The results of taking away our plant energy may not be as sudden as cutting off oxygen, but they are as sure.</font><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scientists have a name for the total amount of plant mass created by Earth in a given year, the total budget for life. They call it the planet&#8217;s &#8220;primary productivity.&#8221; There have been two efforts to figure out how that productivity is spent, one by a group at Stanford University, the other an independent accounting by the biologist Stuart Pimm. Both conclude that we humans, a single species among millions, consume about 40 percent of Earth&#8217;s primary productivity, 40 percent of all there is. This simple number may explain why the current extinction rate is 1,000 times that which existed before human domination of the planet. We 6 billion have simply stolen the food, the rich among us a lot more than others.</font><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Energy cannot be created or canceled, but it can be concentrated. This is the larger and profoundly explanatory context of a national-security memo George Kennan wrote in 1948 as the head of a State Department planning committee, ostensibly about Asian policy but really about how the United States was to deal with its newfound role as the dominant force on Earth. &#8220;We have about 50 percent of the world&#8217;s wealth but only 6.3 percent of its population,&#8221; Kennan wrote. &#8220;In this situation, we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment. Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity without positive detriment to our national security. To do so, we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day-dreaming; and our attention will have to be concentrated everywhere on our immediate national objectives. We need not deceive ourselves that we can afford today the luxury of altruism and world-benefaction.&#8221;</font><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;The day is not far off,&#8221; Kennan concluded, &#8220;when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts.&#8221;</font></p>
<p>If you follow the energy, eventually you will end up in a field somewhere. Humans engage in a dizzying array of artifice and industry. Nonetheless, more than two thirds of humanity&#8217;s cut of primary productivity results from agriculture, two thirds of which in turn consists of three plants: rice, wheat, and corn. In the 10,000 years since humans domesticated these rains, their status has remained undiminished, most likely because they are able to store solar energy in uniquely dense, transportable bundles of carbohydrates. They are to the plant world what a barrel of refined oil is to the hydrocarbon world. Indeed, aside from hydrocarbons they are the most concentrated form of true wealth&#8211;sun energy&#8211;to be found on the planet.</p>
<p>As Kennan recognized, however, the maintenance of such a concentration of wealth often requires violent action. Agriculture is a recent human experiment. For most of human history, we lived by gathering or killing a broad variety of nature&#8217;s offerings. Why humans might have traded this approach for the complexities of agriculture is an interesting and long-debated question, especially because the skeletal evidence clearly indicates that early farmers were more poorly nourished, more disease-ridden and deformed, than their hunter-gatherer contemporaries. Farming did not improve most lives. The evidence that best points to the answer, I think, lies in the difference between early agricultural villages and their pre-agricultural counterparts&#8211;the presence not just of grain but of granaries and, more tellingly, of just a few houses significantly larger and more ornate than all the others attached to those granaries. Agriculture was not so much about food as it was about the accumulation of wealth. It benefited some humans, and those people have been in charge ever since.</p>
<p>Domestication was also a radical change in the distribution of wealth within the plant world. Plants can spend their solar income in several ways. The dominant and prudent strategy is to allocate most of it to building roots, stem, bark&#8211;a conservative portfolio of investments that allows the plant to better gather energy and survive the downturn years. Further, by living in diverse stands (a given chunk of native prairie contains maybe 200 species of plants), these perennials provide services for one another, such as retaining water, protecting one another from wind, and fixing free nitrogen from the air to use as fertilizer. Diversity allows a system to &#8220;sponsor its own fertility,&#8221; to use visionary agronomist Wes Jackson&#8217;s phrase. This is the plant world&#8217;s norm.</p>
<p>There is a very narrow group of annuals, however, that grow in patches of a single species and store almost all of their income as seed, a tight bundle of carbohydrates easily exploited by seed eaters such as ourselves. Under normal circumstances, this eggs-in-one-basket strategy is a dumb idea for a plant. But not during catastrophes such as floods, fires, and volcanic eruptions. Such catastrophes strip established plant communities and create opportunities for wind-scattered entrepreneurial seed bearers. It is no accident that no matter where agriculture sprouted on the globe, it always happened near rivers. You might assume, as many have, that this is because the plants needed the water or nutrients. Mostly this is not true. They needed the power of flooding, which scoured landscapes and stripped out competitors. Nor is it an accident, I think, that agriculture arose independently and simultaneously around the globe just as the last ice age ended, a time of enormous upheaval when glacial melt let loose sea-size lakes to create tidal waves of erosion. It was a time of catastrophe.</p>
<p>Corn, rice, and wheat are especially adapted to catastrophe. It is their niche. In the natural scheme of things, a catastrophe would create a blank slate, bare soil, that was good for them. Then, under normal circumstances, succession would quickly close that niche. The annuals would colonize. Their roots would stabilize the soil, accumulate organic matter, provide cover. Eventually the catastrophic niche would close. Farming is the process of ripping that niche open again and again. It is an annual artificial catastrophe, and it requires the equivalent of three or four tons of TNT per acre for a modern American farm. Iowa&#8217;s fields require the energy of 4,000 Nagasaki bombs every year.</p>
<p>Iowa is almost all fields now. Little prairie remains, and if you can find what Iowans call a &#8220;postage stamp&#8221; remnant of some, it most likely will abut a cornfield. This allows an observation. Walk from the prairie to the field, and you probably will step down about six feet, as if the land had been stolen from beneath you. Settlers&#8217; accounts of the prairie conquest mention a sound, a series of pops, like pistol shots, the sound of stout grass roots breaking before a moldboard plow. A robbery was in progress.</p>
<p>When we say the soil is rich, it is not a metaphor. It is as rich in energy as an oil well. A prairie converts that energy to flowers and roots and stems, which in turn pass back into the ground as dead organic matter. The layers of topsoil build up into a rich repository of energy, a bank. A farm field appropriates that energy, puts it into seeds we can eat. Much of the energy moves from the earth to the rings of fat around our necks and waists. And much of the energy is simply wasted, a trail of dollars billowing from the burglar&#8217;s satchel.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already mentioned that we humans take 40 percent of the globe&#8217;s primary productivity every year. You might have assumed we and our livestock eat our way through that volume, but this is not the case. Part of that total&#8211;almost a third of it&#8211;is the potential plant mass lost when forests are cleared for farming or when tropical rain forests are cut for grazing or when plows destroy the deep mat of prairie roots that held the whole business together, triggering erosion. The Dust Bowl was no accident of nature. A functioning grassland prairie produces more biomass each year than does even the most technologically advanced wheat field. The problem is, it&#8217;s mostly a form of grass and grass roots that humans can&#8217;t eat. So we replace the prairie with our own preferred grass, wheat. Never mind that we feed most of our grain to livestock, and that livestock is perfectly content to eat native grass. And never mind that there likely were more bison produced naturally on the Great Plains before farming than all of beef farming raises in the same area today. Our ancestors found it preferable to pluck the energy from the ground and when it ran out move on.</p>
<p>Today we do the same, only now when the vault is empty we fill it again with new energy in the form of oil-rich fertilizers. Oil is annual primary productivity stored as hydrocarbons, a trust fund of sorts, built up over many thousands of years. On average, it takes 5.5 gallons of fossil energy to restore a year&#8217;s worth of lost fertility to an acre of eroded land&#8211;in 1997 we burned through more than 400 years&#8217; worth of ancient fossilized productivity, most of it from someplace else. Even as the earth beneath Iowa shrinks, it is being globalized.</p>
<p>Six thousand years before sodbusters broke up Iowa, their Caucasian blood ancestors broke up the Hungarian plain, an area just northwest of the Caucasus Mountains. Archaeologists call this tribe the LBK, short for linearbandkeramik, the German word that describes the distinctive pottery remnants that mark their occupation of Europe. Anthropologists call them the wheat-beef people, a name that better connects those ancients along the Danube to my fellow Montanans on the Upper Missouri River. These proto-Europeans had a full set of domesticated plants and animals, but wheat and beef dominated. All the domesticates came from an area along what is now the Iraq-Syria-Turkey border at the edges of the Zagros Mountains. This is the center of domestication for the Western world&#8217;s main crops and live stock, ground zero of catastrophic agriculture.</p>
<p>Two other types of catastrophic agriculture evolved at roughly the same time, one centered on rice in what is now China and India and one centered on corn and potatoes in Central and South America. Rice, though, is tropical and its expansion depends on water, so it developed only in floodplains, estuaries, and swamps. Corn agriculture was every bit as voracious as wheat; the Aztecs could be as brutal and imperialistic as Romans or Brits, but the corn cultures collapsed with the onslaught of Spanish conquest. Corn itself simply joined the wheat-beef people&#8217;s coalition. Wheat was the empire builder; its bare botanical facts dictated the motion and violence that we know as imperialism.</p>
<p>The wheat-beef people swept across the western European plains in less than 300 years, a conquest some archaeologists refer to as a &#8220;blitzkrieg.&#8221; A different race of humans, the Cro-Magnons&#8211;hunter-gatherers, not farmers&#8211;lived on those plains at the time. Their cave art at places such as Lascaux testifies to their sophistication and profound connection to wildlife. They probably did most of their hunting and gathering in uplandsand river bottoms, places the wheat farmers didn&#8217;t need, suggesting the possibility of coexistence. That&#8217;s not what happened, however. Both genetic and linguistic evidence say that the farmers killed the hunters. The Basque people are probably the lone remnant descendants of Cro-Magnons, the only trace.</p>
<p>Hunter-gatherer archaeological sites of the period contain spear points that originally belonged to the farmers, and we can guess they weren&#8217;t trade goods. One group of anthropologists concludes, &#8220;The evidence from the western extension of the LBK leaves little room for any other conclusion but that LBK-Mesolithic interactions were at best chilly and at worst hostile.&#8221; The world&#8217;s surviving Blackfeet, Assiniboine Sioux, Inca, and Maori probably have the best idea of the nature of these interactions.</p>
<p>Wheat is temperate and prefers plowed-up grasslands. The globe has a limited stock of temperate grasslands, just as it has a limited stock of all other biomes. On average, about 10 percent of all other biomes remain in something like their native state today. Only 1 percent of temperate grasslands remains undestroyed. Wheat takes what it needs.</p>
<p>The supply of temperate grasslands lies in what are today the United States, Canada, the South American pampas, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Europe, and the Asiatic extension of the European plain into the sub-Siberian steppes. This area largely describes the First World, the developed world. Temperate grasslands make up not only the habitat of wheat and beef but also the globe&#8217;s islands of Caucasians, of European surnames and languages. In 2000 the countries of the temperate grasslands, the neo-Europes, accounted for about 80 percent of all wheat exports in the world, and about 86 percent of all com. That is to say, the neo-Europes drive the world&#8217;s agriculture. The dominance does not stop with grain. These countries, plus the mothership&#8211;Europe accounted for three fourths of all agricultural exports of all crops in the world in 1999.</p>
<p>Plato wrote of his country&#8217;s farmlands:</p>
<p>What now remains of the formerly rich land is like the skeleton of a sick man. &#8230;Formerly, many of the mountains were arable, The plains that were full of rich soil are now marshes. Hills that were once covered with forests and produced abundant pasture now produce only food for bees. Once the land was enriched by yearly rains, which were not lost, as they are now, by flowing from the bare land into the sea. The soil was deep, it absorbed and kept the water in loamy soil, and the water that soaked into the hills fed springs and running streams everywhere. Now the abandoned shrines at spots where formerly there were springs attest that our description of the land is true.</p>
<p>Plato&#8217;s lament is rooted in wheat agriculture, which depleted his country&#8217;s soil and subsequently caused the series of declines that pushed centers of civilization to Rome, Turkey, and western Europe. By the fifth century, though, wheat&#8217;s strategy of depleting and moving on ran up against the Atlantic Ocean. Fenced-in wheat agriculture is like rice agriculture. It balances its equations with famine. In the millennium between 500 and 1500, Britain suffered a major &#8220;corrective&#8221; famine about every ten years; there were seventy-five in France during the same period. The incidence, however, dropped sharply when colonization brought an influx of new food to Europe.</p>
<p>The new lands had an even greater effect on the colonists themselves. Thomas Jefferson, after enduring a lecture on the rustic nature by his hosts at a dinner party in Paris, pointed out that all of the Americans present were a good head taller than all of the French. Indeed, colonists in all of the neo-Europes enjoyed greater stature and longevity, as well as a lower infant-mortality rate&#8211;all indicators of the better nutrition afforded by the onetime spend down of the accumulated capital of virgin soil.</p>
<p>The precolonial famines of Europe raised the question: What would happen when the planet&#8217;s supply of arable land ran out? We have a clear answer. In about 1960 expansion hit its limits and the supply of unfarmed, arable lands came to an end. There was nothing left to plow. What happened was grain yields tripled.</p>
<p>The accepted term for this strange turn of events is the green revolution, though it would be more properly labeled the amber revolution, because it applied exclusively to grain&#8211;wheat, rice, and corn. Plant breeders tinkered with the architecture of these three grains so that they could be hypercharged with irrigation water and chemical fertilizers, especially nitrogen. This innovation meshed nicely with the increased &#8220;efficiency&#8221; of the industrialized factory-farm system. With the possible exception of the domestication of wheat, the green revolution is the worst thing that has ever happened to the planet.</p>
<p>For openers, it disrupted long-standing patterns of rural life worldwide, moving a lot of no-longer-needed people off the land and into the world&#8217;s most severe poverty. The experience in population control in the developing world is by now clear: It is not that people make more people so much as it is that they make more poor people. In the forty-year period beginning about 1960, the world&#8217;s population doubled, adding virtually the entire increase of 3 billion to the world&#8217;s poorest classes, the most fecund classes. The way in which the green revolution raised that grain contributed hugely to the population boom, and it is the weight of the population that leaves humanity in its present untenable position.</p>
<p>Discussion of these, the most poor, however, is largely irrelevant to the American situation. We say we have poor people here, but almost no one in this country lives on less than one dollar a day, the global benchmark for poverty. It marks off a class of about 1.3 billion people, the hard core of the larger group of 2 billion chronically malnourished people&#8211;that is, one third of humanity. We may forget about them, as most Americans do.</p>
<p>More relevant here are the methods of the green revolution, which added orders of magnitude to the devastation. By mining the iron for tractors, drilling the new oil to fuel them and to make nitrogen fertilizers, and by taking the water that rain and rivers had meant for other lands, farming had extended its boundaries, its dominion, to lands that were not farmable. At the same time, it extended its boundaries across time, tapping fossil energy, stripping past assets.</p>
<p>The common assumption these days is that we muster our weapons to secure oil, not food. There&#8217;s a little joke in this. Ever since we ran out of arable land, food is oil. Every single calorie we eat is backed by at least a calorie of oil, more like ten. In 1940 the average farm in the United States produced 2.3 calories of food energy for every calorie of fossil energy it used. By 1974 (the last year in which anyone looked closely at this issue), that ratio was 1:1. And this understates the problem, because at the same time that there is more oil in our food there is less oil in our oil. A couple of generations ago we spent a lot less energy drilling, pumping, and distributing than we do now. In the 1940s we got about 100 barrels of oil back for every barrel of oil we spent getting it. Today each barrel invested in the process returns only ten, a calculation that no doubt fails to include the fuel burned by the Hummers and Blackhawks we use to maintain access to the oil in Iraq.</p>
<p>David Pimentel, an expert on food and energy at Cornell University, has estimated that if all of the world ate the way the United States eats, humanity would exhaust all known global fossil-fuel reserves in just over seven years. Pimentel has his detractors. Some have accused him of being off on other calculations by as much as 30 percent. Fine. Make it ten years.</p>
<p>Fertilizer makes a pretty fine bomb right off the shelf, a chemistry lesson Timothy McVeigh taught at Oklahoma City&#8217;s Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in 1995&#8211;not a small matter, in that the green revolution has made nitrogen fertilizers ubiquitous in some of the more violent and desperate corners of the world. Still, there is more to contemplate in nitrogen&#8217;s less sensational chemistry.</p>
<p>The chemophobia of modem times excludes fear of the simple elements of chemistry&#8217;s periodic table. We circulate petitions, hold hearings, launch websites, and buy and sell legislators in regard to polysyllabic organic compounds&#8211;polychlorinated biphenyls, polyvinyls, DDT, 2-4d, that sort of thing&#8211;not simple carbon or nitrogen. Not that agriculture&#8217;s use of the more ornate chemistry is benign&#8211;an infant born in a rural, wheat-producing county in the United States has about twice the chance of suffering birth defects as one born in a rural place that doesn&#8217;t produce wheat, an effect researchers blame on chlorophenoxy herbicides. Focusing on pesticide pollution, though, misses the worst of the pollutants. Forget the polysyllabic organics. It is nitrogen-the wellspring of fertility relied upon by every Eden-obsessed backyard gardener and suburban groundskeeper&#8211;that we should fear most.</p>
<p>Those who model our planet as an organism do so on the basis that the earth appears to breathe&#8211;it thrives by converting a short list of basic elements from one compound into the next, just as our own bodies cycle oxygen into carbon dioxide and plants cycle carbon dioxide into oxygen. In fact, two of the planet&#8217;s most fundamental humors are oxygen and carbon dioxide. Another is nitrogen.</p>
<p>Nitrogen can be released from its &#8220;fixed&#8221; state as a solid in the soil by natural processes that allow it to circulate freely in the atmosphere. This also can be done artificially. Indeed, humans now contribute more nitrogen to the nitrogen cycle than the planet itself does. That is, humans have doubled the amount of nitrogen in play.</p>
<p>This has led to an imbalance. It is easier to create nitrogen fertilizer than it is to apply it evenly to fields. When farmers dump nitrogen on a crop, much is wasted. It runs into the water and soil, where it either reacts chemically with its surroundings to form new compounds or flows off to fertilize something else, somewhere else.</p>
<p>That chemical reaction, called acidification, is noxious and contributes significantly to acid rain. One of the compounds produced by acidification is nitrous oxide, which aggravates the greenhouse effect. Green growing things normally offset global warming by sucking up carbon dioxide, but nitrogen on farm fields plus methane from decomposing vegetation make every farmed acre, like every acre of Los Angeles freeway, a net contributor to global warming. Fertilization is equally worrisome. Rainfall and irrigation water inevitably washes the nitrogen from fields to creeks and streams, which flows into rivers, which floods into the ocean. This explains why the Mississippi River, which drains the nation&#8217;s Corn Belt, is an environmental catastrophe. The nitrogen fertilizes artificially large blooms of algae that in growing suck all the oxygen from the water, a condition biologists call anoxia, which means &#8220;oxygen-depleted.&#8221; Here there&#8217;s no need to calculate long-term effects, because life in such places has no long term: everything dies immediately. The Mississippi River&#8217;s heavily fertilized effluvia has created a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico the size of New Jersey.</p>
<p>America&#8217;s biggest crop, grain corn, is completely unpalatable. It is raw material for an industry that manufactures food substitutes. Likewise, you can&#8217;t eat unprocessed wheat. You certainly can&#8217;t eat hay. You can eat unprocessed soybeans, but mostly we don&#8217;t. These four crops cover 82 percent of American cropland. Agriculture in this country is not about food; it&#8217;s about commodities that require the outlay of still more energy to become food.</p>
<p>About two thirds of U.S. grain corn is labeled &#8220;processed,&#8221; meaning it is milled and otherwise refined for food or industrial uses. More than 45 percent of that becomes sugar, especially high-fructose corn sweeteners, the keystone ingredient in three quarters of all processed foods, especially soft drinks, the food of America&#8217;s poor and working classes. It is not a coincidence that the American pandemic of obesity tracks rather nicely with the fivefold increase in corn-syrup production since Archer Daniels Midland developed a high-fructose version of the stuff in the early seventies. Nor is it a coincidence that the plague selects the poor, who eat the most processed food.</p>
<p>It began with the industrialization of Victorian England. The empire was then flush with sugar from plantations in the colonies. Meantime the cities were flush with factory workers. There was no good way to feed them. And thus was born the afternoon tea break, the tea consisting primarily of warm water and sugar. If the workers were well off, they could also afford bread with heavily sugared jam&#8211;sugar-powered industrialization. There was a 500 percent increase in per capita sugar consumption in Britain between 1860 and 1890, around the time when the life expectancy of a male factory worker was seventeen years. By the end of the century the average Brit was getting about one sixth of his total nutrition from sugar, exactly the same percentage Americans get today&#8211;double what nutritionists recommend.</p>
<p>There is another energy matter to consider here, though. The grinding, milling, wetting, drying, and baking of a breakfast cereal requires about four calories of energy for every calorie of food energy it produces. A two-pound bag of breakfast cereal burns the energy of a half-gallon of gasoline in its making. All together the food-processing industry in the United States uses about ten calories of fossil-fuel energy for every calorie of food energy it produces.</p>
<p>That number does not include the fuel used in transporting the food from the factory to a store near you, or the fuel used by millions of people driving to thousands of super discount stores on the edge of town, where the land is cheap. It appears, however, that the corn cycle is about to come full circle. If a bipartisan coalition of farm-state lawmakers has their way&#8211;and it appears they will&#8211;we will soon buy gasoline containing twice as much fuel alcohol as it does now. Fuel alcohol already ranks second as a use for processed corn in the United States, just behind corn sweeteners. According to one set of calculations, we spend more calories of fossil-fuel energy making ethanol than we gain from it. The Department of Agriculture says the ratio is closer to a gallon and a quart of ethanol for every gallon of fossil fuel we invest. The USDA calls this a bargain, because gasohol is a &#8220;clean fuel.&#8221; This claim to cleanness is in dispute at the tailpipe level, and it certainly ignores the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, pesticide pollution, and the haze of global gases gathering over every farm field. Nor does this claim cover clean conscience; some still might be unsettled knowing that our SUVs&#8217; demands for fuel compete with the poor&#8217;s demand for grain.</p>
<p>Green eaters, especially vegetarians, advocate eating low on the food chain, a simple matter of energy flow. Eating a carrot gives the diner all that carrot&#8217;s energy, but feeding carrots to a chicken, then eating the chicken, reduces the energy by a factor of ten. The chicken wastes some energy, stores some as feathers, bones, and other inedibles, and uses most of it just to live long enough to be eaten. As a rough rule of thumb, that factor of ten applies to each level up the food chain, which is why some fish, such as tuna, can be a horror in all of this. Tuna is a secondary predator, meaning it not only doesn&#8217;t eat plants but eats other fish that themselves eat other fish, adding a zero to the multiplier each notch up, easily a hundred times, more like a thousand times less efficient than eating a plant.</p>
<p>This is fine as far as it goes, but the vegetarian&#8217;s case can break down on some details. On the moral issues, vegetarians claim their habits are kinder to animals, though it is difficult to see how wiping out 99 percent of wildlife&#8217;s habitat, as farming has done in Iowa, is a kindness. In rural Michigan, for example, the potato farmers have a peculiar tactic for dealing with the predations of whitetail deer. They gut-shoot them with small-bore rifles, in hopes the deer will limp off to the woods and die where they won&#8217;t stink up the potato fields.</p>
<p>Animal rights aside, vegetarians can lose the edge in the energy argument by eating processed food, with its ten calories of fossil energy for every calorie of food energy produced. The question, then, is: Does eating processed food such as soy burger or soy milk cancel the energy benefits of vegetarianism, which is to say, can I eat my lamb chops in peace? Maybe. If I&#8217;ve done my due diligence, I will have found out that the particular lamb I am eating was both local and grass-fed, two factors that of course greatly reduce the embedded energy in a meal. I know of ranches here in Montana, for instance, where sheep eat native grass under closely controlled circumstances&#8211;no farming, no plows, no corn, no nitrogen. Assets have not been stripped. I can&#8217;t eat the grass directly. This can go on. There are little niches like this in the system. Each person&#8217;s individual charge is to find such niches.</p>
<p>Chances are, though, any meat eater will come out on the short end of this argument, especially in the United States. Take the case of beef. Cattle are grazers, so in theory could live like the grass-fed lamb. Some cattle cultures&#8211;those of South America and Mexico, for example&#8211;have perfected wonderful cuisines based on grass-fed beef. This is not our habit in the United States, and it is simply a matter of habit. Eighty percent of the grain the United States produces goes to livestock. Seventy-eight percent of all of our beef comes from feed lots, where the cattle eat grain, mostly corn and wheat. So do most of our hogs and chickens. The cattle spend their adult lives packed shoulder to shoulder in a space not much bigger than their bodies, up to their knees in shit, being stuffed with grain and a constant stream of antibiotics to prevent the disease this sort of confinement invariably engenders. The manure is rich in nitrogen and once provided a farm&#8217;s fertilizer. The feedlots, however, are now far removed from farm fields, so it is simply not &#8220;efficient&#8221; to haul it to cornfields. It is waste. It exhales methane, a global-warming gas. It pollutes streams. It takes thirty-five calories of fossil fuel to make a calorie of beef this way; sixty-eight to make one calorie of pork.</p>
<p>Still, these livestock do something we can&#8217;t. They convert grain&#8217;s carbohydrates to high-quality protein. All well and good, except that per capita protein production in the United States is about double what an average adult needs per day. Excess cannot be stored as protein in the human body but is simply converted to fat. This is the end result of a factory-farm system that appears as a living, continental-scale monument to Rube Goldberg, a black-mass remake of the loaves-and-fishes miracle. Prairie&#8217;s productivity is lost for grain, grain&#8217;s productivity is lost in livestock, livestock&#8217;s protein is lost to human fat&#8211;all federally subsidized for about $15 billion a year, two thirds of which goes directly to only two crops, corn and wheat.</p>
<p>This explains why the energy expert David Pimentel is so worried that the rest of the world will adopt America&#8217;s methods. He should be, because the rest of the world is. Mexico now feeds 45 percent of its grain to livestock, up from 5 percent in 1960. Egypt went from 3 percent to 31 percent in the same period, and China, with a sixth of the world&#8217;s population, has gone from 8 percent to 26 percent. All of these places have poor people who could use the grain, but they can&#8217;t afford it.</p>
<p>I live among elk and have learned to respect them. One moonlit night during the dead of last winter, I looked out my bedroom window to see about twenty of them grazing a plot of grass the size of a living room. Just that small patch among acres of other species of native prairie grass. Why that species and only that species of grass that night in the worst of winter when the threat to their survival was the greatest? What magic nutrient did this species alone contain? What does a wild animal know that we don&#8217;t? I think we need this knowledge.</p>
<p>Food is politics. That being the case, I voted twice in 2002. The day after Election Day, in a truly dismal mood, I climbed the mountain behind my house and found a small herd of elk grazing native grasses in the morning sunlight. My respect for these creatures over the years has become great enough that on that morning I did not hesitate but went straight to my job, which was to rack a shell and drop one cow elk, my household&#8217;s annual protein supply. I voted with my weapon of choice&#8211;an act not all that uncommon in this world, largely, I think, as a result of the way we grow food. I can see why it is catching on. Such a vote has a certain satisfying heft and finality about it. My particular bit of violence, though, is more satisfying, I think, than the rest of the globe&#8217;s ordinary political mayhem. I used a rifle to opt out of an insane system. I killed, but then so did you when you bought that package of burger, even when you bought that package of tofu burger. I killed, then the rest of those elk went on, as did the grasses, the birds, the trees, the coyotes, mountain lions, and bugs, the fundamental productivity of an intact natural system, all of it went on.</p>

			<p>Many people were horrified by the scandal surrounding cattle that were so weak that they were either being prodded with a forklift or actually carried to the kill room with the fork lift. Most people, not being involved in agriculture, wondered how anyone could be so callous. BUT the most disgusting thing you run into when you look into the issue of Factory Farming Cattle (and there are a lot of nasty things here) is that the corn that is feed to the cattle after they are weaned is killing them. So to slaughterhouse staff and meat packers its a matter timing whether they get them in the kill room before they die.</p>

CHINO, Calif. &#8212; Last year, a man carrying a hidden video camera took a $12-an-hour job at a little-known beef slaughterhouse here. Now the meatpacker is about to collapse, and has become a flashpoint in a national debate over meat safety and the quality of food Americans serve their schoolchildren.</p>
<p>Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Co., one of the biggest suppliers of beef to the national school-lunch program before videos showing animal cruelty at the plant helped trigger the biggest meat recall in U.S. history, probably will shut down permanently, according to the company&#8217;s general manager, Anthony Magidow.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>As John Robbins points out modern cattle raising is all about carving up cattle quick:</p>
<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#000099"><strong>What About Grass-fed Beef?</strong></font></p>
<p><a href="/wp-admin/#Email this article to"></a> <!--CONTENTS START HERE -->Feeding grain to cattle has got to be one of the dumbest ideas in the history of western civilization.</p>
<p>Cows, sheep, and other grazing animals are endowed with the ability to convert grasses, which those of us who possess only one stomach cannot digest, into food that we can digest. They can do this because they are ruminants, which is to say that they possess a rumen, a 45 or so gallon (in the case of cows) fermentation tank in which resident bacteria convert cellulose into protein and fats.</p>
<p>Traditionally, all beef was grass-fed beef, but in the United States today what is commercially available is almost all feedlot beef. The reason? It&#8217;s faster, and so more profitable. Seventy-five years ago, steers were 4 or 5 years old at slaughter. Today, they are 14 or 16 months. You can&#8217;t take a beef calf from a birth weight of 80 pounds to 1,200 pounds in a little more than a year on grass. It takes enormous quantities of corn, protein supplements, antibiotics and other drugs, including growth hormones.</p>
<p>Switching a cow from grass to grain is so disturbing to the animal&#8217;s digestive system that it can kill the animal if not done gradually and if the animal is not continually fed antibiotics. These animals are designed to forage, but we make them eat grain, primarily corn, in order to make them as fat as possible as fast as possible.<br>
 All this is not only unnatural and dangerous for the cows. It also has profound consequences for us. Feedlot beef as we know it today would be impossible if it weren&#8217;t for the routine and continual feeding of antibiotics to these animals. This leads directly and inexorably to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These are the new &#8220;superbugs&#8221; that are increasingly rendering our &#8220;miracle drugs&#8221; ineffective.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Letting Corporations into anything in agriculture besides processing is turning out to be a disaster in many respects from beginning to end. To this end we could talk about any plant or animal that we eat, but if we keep our focus on corn it becomes clear that all the corporate ag production affairs require one thing energy and lots of it.</p>
<p>While the movie, King Corn, has a lot going for it, like cute college kids out for a lark and the absurdity of growing an acre of anything in the current farm system, it is actually a pretty good look at why growing as much corn as we do is stupid and corporate farming only compounds that.</p>

<p>While the planting, growing and harvesting of field corn takes an incredible amount of energy, the real energy comes after it has been harvested. You can&#8217;t eat the stuff so it all has to be PROCESSED to be used or eaten by animals most of which don&#8217;t like the stuff but eat it if they are forced to.

<p>OKOKOKOKOK So maybe corn IS killing us but will we miss it when its gone because of energy prices. Probably not one bit though the first winter maybe tough if gasoline goes to $100 a gallon. The first to go though will be the exporting of grain. Do you believe we actually pile billions of tons of corn on diesal power ships so that other people can refine (errr spend their energy on) it? They can&#8217;t eat it either.</p>

			<p>Well actually it doesn&#8217;t. But it will definitely change our lifestyles and our foodchain. But not really the way either the right or the left think or at least want you to believe. Believe me I am not being callous when I simply say that lots of people will die. There is no denying that and if we let it CHAOS could insue. But I don&#8217;t it will happen that way. One way or another we will either very quickly get a lot more renewable energy sources in place or we as a nation will be forced to return to a small farm society. The Saudi&#8217;s know for sure what is coming because they just anounced another huge solar project. Something like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9D07E1D71639F932A35752C1A965948260">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9D07E1D71639F932A35752C1A965948260</a></p>
<p>TWO years ago, this village of 3,000 people, only 20 miles from Riyadh, the capital of this kingdom, had no electricity. Today, villagers proudly display their televisions, toasters and other accouterments of an electrified society.</p>
<p>But when Saudis here turn their lights on at night, they are using energy generated not by their country&#8217;s vast oil reserves, but by the sun.</p>
<p>This village and two others nearby are the first in the kingdom, or anywhere, to be powered continuously and primarily by solar power.</p>

<p>Please note the bell shaped curve above. That is their arguement in a nutshell. In other words demand has exceeded the ability of the oil producers to provide oil. That ability to produce will eventually &#8220;fall off&#8221; as the supply ends and prices will go through the roof (read: become prohibitive). So what does that mean for the now Industrialized Foodchain?</p>
<p>In Michael Pollan&#8217;s 2006 book, The Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemma, he lays out huge problems with our corporate food chain:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Omnivore's_Dilemma">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Omnivore&#8217;s_Dilemma</a></p>
<p> <span class="mw-headline">Industrial</span></p>
<p>Pollan begins with an exploration of the food-production system from which the vast majority of <a href="/wiki/Standard_American_Diet" title="Standard American Diet">American meals</a> are derived. This industrial food chain is largely based on <a href="/wiki/Maize" title="Maize">corn</a>, whether it is eaten directly, fed to <a href="/wiki/Livestock" title="Livestock">livestock</a>, or processed into chemicals such as <a href="/wiki/Glucose" title="Glucose">glucose</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ethanol" title="Ethanol">ethanol</a>. Pollan discusses how the humble corn plant came to dominate the American diet through a combination of biological, cultural, and political factors. The role of <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> in the cultivation and <a href="/wiki/Transport" title="Transport">transportation</a> of the American food supply is also discussed.</p>
<p>A <a href="/wiki/Fast_food" title="Fast food">fast food</a> meal is used to illustrate the end result of the industrial food chain.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>In fact a scientist said that if humanity quit using nitrogen fertilizer it would be like taking EVERY automobile in the WORLD off the road.</p>
<p>However its interesting that he actually fails in what he sets out to do. His goal was actually to grow throught the progression of Industrial&#8212;&gt; Small Farm&#8212;&gt; Vegan&#8212;&gt;Make my own meal. He wanted to make the point that Vegatarion was the way to go to save the planet from us humans. His thought being that he would make up a giant tofu salad at the end of the book. It did not go that way, because he quickly discovered that going meatless is tougher than he thought AND that it would take MORE energy inputs than we currently use to take the whole USA vegatarian. In other words we omnivores by DESIGN (duh) and we can&#8217;t change that by wishing it to be so. In the end he makes his meal and includes fish in it to show that heh you can &#8220;eat locally&#8221;.  Hunting animals is a lot tougher  than fishing. But heh he does not say how long it took to catch the one he shared.</p>
<p>Next &#8211; On to King Corn.<br>

			<p>Since the Peak Oil people have managed to scare the begeezus out of the whole world. I though that it was time to engage in a meditation on the Relationship between Food and Energy. Having sat through similar meditations on Religion and Energy Conservation (18 posts) and Energy Policy and the Presidential Candidates (17 posts) I can assure you this will not take more than 3 or 4 posts and will probably include Weird Bird Friday.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s start with  Michael Pollan&#8217;s book The Omnivore&#8217;s Delimma and a film, King Corn, by Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis, to take an initial pass at the problem.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/kingcorn/">http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/kingcorn/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.michaelpollan.com/omnivore.php">http://www.michaelpollan.com/omnivore.php</a></p>
<p>But before we do let&#8217;s do a little thought experiment because King Corn and the Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemma both ultimately fail in what they hope to accomplish.  In fact, I think that the high price of oil right now is being manipulated by the producers, the futures market and the refiners and it will come down. But as I have said to the Peak Oil people all along, we are maybe at the &#8220;oil Plateau&#8221;, but we are not at the &#8220;decline&#8221; part of the curve. It WILL COME. Thus, it is good to think about the situation to see what may happen.</p>
<p>As an aside here for another second. I have actually thought about farming for alot of my life because I believe that the world is warming because of our release of greenhouse gases, and that warming will destabalize our weather. That in effect would disrupt the farmers and thus the food supply. Under the &#8220;Peak Oil&#8221; senario what would happen is that all of the energy inputs into our industrial linear monocultural food chain would be withdrawn. This means no fertilizers, and no transportation for the food grown. Or maybe foods that can travel less distances. But eventually this would leaves us with no fuel to drive the tractors to plant the seeds and a loss of refrigeration. Or at least the type of refrigeration we are used to. If you believe their worst case senarios this could happen rather quickly. Think, as one of their leading bloggers recently said, about the impact of gasoline that costs 100$$ a gallon. I live about 6 or 7 miles from Springfield and I can tell you I would be walking to town at that point.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Still would we all die? If you mean ALL as Humanity, yes many of us would die if the worldwide food chain were disrupted. But think about it in another way, food would become trapped in the producing and exporting nations. So those countries would be awash in the foods that they produce. As we have seen in this last round of oil price increases the poorer countries of the world would face food riots, mass starvation, disease and death. In a moral cataclysm, the question for the 3rd world would be what to do with the bodies. Burying them would be dumb, burning them even worse…but should we recycle dead humans? Maybe we need to think about that.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">In much of the world and even in parts of the third world what would happen is that we all would have to become hunters and gathers again. I am not saying that lives would not be lost, and that tremendous tumult would not result but at least initially we all would have to become small plot croppers like we did during WWII. When I mention Victory Gardens to the PO (peak oil) folks they go ballistic. They jump up and down and shout, &#8220;It&#8217;s the population stupid.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 81.0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">So if the ALL in We Are All Going To Die is we folks in the US of A then let&#8217;s look at it. In 1940 there were 133 million people in the US, now there are roughly 280 million people. So a simple analysis could say that 150 million people here would die. That is to die back to the point where Victory Gardens were effective. But I have my doubts about that. Looking at the worst disaster to hit this country, the Flu Pandemic of 1918 the US suffered a net loss of population of 60 thousand people. That was .06% of the population.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 81.0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 81.0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">I also am intellectually opposed to &#8220;science fiction&#8221; posturings where the rich rule the world and the poor eat Solent Green. Nonetheless I am not naïve enough to assume that millions won&#8217;t die here. The Pandemic actually wiped out a birth rate producing 1.5 million people a year before it &#8220;went negative&#8221;. Would we survive as a capitalist democracy? That is a much bigger question. It would be imperative in that first farming year that fuel prices spiked that every scrap of food grown is preserved. Capitalists might not be willing to pay the cost of that. Would many of us end up eating field corn or something made out of it. Heck yes. Would our livestock have to get by on grass? Oh yah. Would the megacities empty. I don&#8217;t know, but again the problem is corporate land ownership. That land would have to be expropriated to put small producers on it. Is democracy up for the test? It may have no choice.</font></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 81.0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; tab-stops: 81.0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman">Would I survive as a country boy living in the middle of Illinois? Yes, I believe I would. Country Boys Will Survive. God, I have always wanted to say that.</font></p>

<h5>2000</h5>
<p>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is a part of the US Public Health Service (PHS). The PHS and NIOSH have conducted a series of studies since 1950 on the health of uranium miners. The following has information about the results of the latest study.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The PHS began the study in 1950 because of concerns that uranium mining causes lung cancer. (We know that miners were not informed of these concerns at the time). We call it a mortality study because it looks at whether miners have been dying of certain diseases at a higher than normal rate.</p>
<p>NIOSH researchers took over the study in the 1970s, and it has been &#8220;updated&#8221; several times. The following describes the results of the most recent update.</p>
<h4>How the Study Was Done</h4>
<p>The mortality study did not include all uranium miners. The study group was only made up of uranium miners who worked underground for at least one month. Also, each miner must have taken part in at least one of the medical exams conducted by the PHS between 1950 and 1960.</p>
<p>First we obtained miners&#8217; work histories. We obtained smoking histories from the medical exams. Next we used death certificates to find out what miners died from. Then we compared the death rates in miners to death rates in the general population of the mining states. The rates in the general population gave us the number of expected deaths in miners. When the number of deaths in miners is greater than the expected number, then an association with mining is suspected.</p>
<p>Because death rates are different for people of different races, we did one study on 3,238 white miners. We did a second study on 757 Native American, African American, and Asian miners. (All but 4 of the 757 miners were Native Americans, mainly Navajo). The following will review the results from each study.</p>
<h4>Radon Gas and &#8220;Radon Daughters&#8221;</h4>
<p>From the start, radioactive radon gas and radon &#8220;daughters&#8221; in the air were suspected as the cause of the lung cancer. Radiation can be thought of like invisible radio waves (only radio waves are harmless) or like specks of dust so tiny they are invisible. We estimated how much of the radon daughters each miner was exposed to by a unit called the working level month. We then looked to see if death rates increased with higher working level months.</p>
<p>This exposure-response relationship is strong evidence of an association between disease and exposure. It is used to show that the longer a miner is exposed to radon gas, the greater may be the risk of lung cancer.</p>
<h4>Results for White Uranium Miners</h4>
<p>The study looked at all causes of death. Only the causes of death listed below were significantly above normal. The results for all other causes of death were within the normal range.</p>
<ul>
<li>We found strong evidence for an increased risk for lung cancer in white uranium miners. We expected about 64 deaths, but found 371. This means we found about 6 times more lung cancer deaths than expected.There was an exposure-response relationship with exposure to radon daughters in the mines. When radon daughters are breathed in, they decay radioactively in the lung. This can cause lung cancer.</li>
<li>We also found strong evidence for pneumoconiosis, a type of lung disease (other than cancer) which is caused by dust. We expected less than 2 deaths, but found 41. There were about 24 times more of these deaths than expected.This category includes silicosis, a disease caused by breathing in a particular mining dust, silica. Silicosis causes scarring of the lung and severe breathing problems. The risk of these lung diseases was greater the longer miners had worked in the mine.</li>
<li>We expected to see about 3 ½ deaths from the infectious lung disease tuberculosis (TB), but we saw 13. This is about 4 times more deaths than expected. This could have been related to the silicosis. People with silicosis are more likely to get TB.</li>
<li>We expected to see about 22 ½ deaths from emphysema but found 56. This is 2 ½ times more deaths than expected. Some of this result could have been related to cigarette smoking. People who smoke are more likely to get emphysema.</li>
<li>We expected to see about 68 deaths from injuries and found 143. This is over 2 times more deaths than expected.</li>
<li>We also saw a greater risk of deaths from the categories &#8220;benign and unspecified cancers&#8221; and &#8220;diseases of the blood&#8221;. Both of these categories had small numbers of deaths. Therefore, it is possible that the increased risk may not be due to mining.</li>
<li>Finally, we saw a greater risk for &#8220;all deaths combined&#8221;. We expected 986 deaths and found 1,595. This is 1 ½ times more deaths than expected.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Results for Non-White Miners</h4>
<p>The study looked at all causes of death. Only the causes of death listed below were significantly above normal. The results for all other causes of death were within the normal range.</p>
<ul>
<li>We found strong evidence for an increased risk for lung cancer in non-white uranium miners. We expected about 10 deaths, but found 34. This means we found over 3 times more lung cancer deaths than expected.There was an exposure-response relationship with exposure to radon daughters in the mines. When radon daughters are breathed in, they decay radioactively in the lung. This can cause lung cancer.</li>
<li>We also found strong evidence for pneumoconioses and other lung diseases (other than cancer). We expected about 8 deaths, but found 20. This means there were about 2 ½ times more of these deaths than expected.This category includes many different diseases. They include silicosis. a disease caused by breathing in a particular mining dust, silica. Silicosis causes scarring of the lung and severe breathing problems. The risk of these lung diseases was greater the longer miners had worked in the mine.</li>
<li>We expected to see about 4 ½ deaths from the infectious lung disease tuberculosis (TB), but we saw 12. There were about 2½ times more of these deaths than expected. This could have been related to the silicosis. People with silicosis are more likely to get TB.</li>

<p class="article-info"><span class="article-type">SIDEBAR</span> &#8211; <span class="article-date"><a href="http://www.hcn.org/servlets/hcn.Issue?issue_id=343">April 2, 2007</a> </span><span class="article-author">by Ray Ring</span></p>
<p>At least 89 people died on the job in the Interior West’s oil and gas industry from 2000 to 2006, in a variety of accidents, including 90-foot falls, massive explosions, poison gas inhalations and crushings by safety harnesses. Some states choose to have the federal government handle worker safety regulation, and some create state agencies to handle it; all the agencies tend to go by the nickname OSHA, after the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.</p>
<p>Some fines in the cases listed below are not directly related to fatalities; sometimes investigators notice unrelated safety violations when they visit workplaces where workers have died.</p>
<p>This list is almost certainly incomplete, due to loopholes in requirements for reporting fatalities.</p>
<p>The list below includes the victims’ names, age at time of death, date of the accident, company(s) involved, a description of the accident, and fines, if any. Names with hotlinks connect to .pdf’s of complete OSHA incident reports.</p>
<h3>COLORADO</h3>
