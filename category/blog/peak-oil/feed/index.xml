<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388764500577_2312">For regulations to work, levied fines must exceed the financial benefit a company gains by violating the rules. None of the rulemaking sanctions meet this criterion. This results in the other 150 pages of rules being essentially meaningless because they will be ignored.   The draft rule sanctions place the Hydraulic Fracturing Regulatory Act (HFRA)  on the road to failure before the first permit is issued.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388764500577_2313"><em>Examples:</em></p>
<ol id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388764500577_2315">
<li id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388764500577_2314">Section 1-100(b) of the law specifies misdemeanor and felony criminal charges for a number of violations of the law.  Yet there are NO criminal charges in the rules</li>
<li id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388764500577_2316">In Section 1-60(a)1-6 of the law, there are six (6) grounds for suspension or revocation of a permit.  These are re-listed with a 7th in section 245.1100 of the rules.  But the very next  section of the Rules&#8211;245.1110&#8211;reduces the grounds for an immediate permit suspension to one: &#8220;an emergency condition posing a significant hazard to the public health, aquatic life, wildlife or the environment.” This is the most stringent requirement of the seven grounds listed in section 245.1100.  Why bother to list seven possible grounds for permit suspension or revocation in section 245.1100 if you then require the Department to identify the most stringent criteria for an immediate suspension.</li>
<li id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388764500577_2317">Section 1-60(b) of the law requires a much lower standard of proof to suspend, revoke or deny a permit than the rules (245.1110).  Under the law, the Department need only serve notice of its action (to suspend, revoke or deny), including a statement of the reasons for the action.</li>
<li id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388764500577_2323">In the law, if a well operator’s permit has been suspended, the burden of proof is on well operator to prove that the identified problem is<strong><em> “no significant threat to public health, aquatic life, wildlife, or the environment&#8221; </em></strong>[Section 1-60(d)].  In the rules, this phrase becomes something <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IDNR</span></strong> must prove <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before ordering a permit suspension</span> [Rule Section 245.1100(b)3A].</li>
<li id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388764500577_2322">Sections 1-100 and 1-101 of the law have some stiff penalties that accrue on a daily basis until the reason for the fine is corrected.  These fines can go as high as $50,000 per violation and up to $10,000 per day.  These are replaced by fines so trivial ($50-$2500) that it will cost the IDNR more to impose and collect a fine than the dollar value of the fine itself.</li>
</ol>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388764500577_2318"><strong>Revisions Needed:</strong>  Return to the standards of the law with regard to fines, penalties and revocations.</p>

<h1>Tesla Motors Launches Revolutionary Supercharger Enabling Convenient Long Distance Driving</h1>
<p><a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0LkuYg8PmJQDVIAfgOVuodG;_ylu=X3oDMTFqMDgxZXM0BG1pdANBcnRpY2xlIEJvZHkEcG9zAzEEc2VjA01lZGlhQXJ0aWNsZUJvZHlBc3NlbWJseQ--;_ylg=X3oDMTJuaGNnbWgyBGludGwDdXMEbGFuZwNlbi11cwRwc3RhaWQDMDg3NWNjMjEtY2EwNS0zZDQ3LWFjM2QtMjc3NmNmODgzZjA4BHBzdGNhdANuZXdzBHB0A3N0b3J5cGFnZQ--;_ylv=0/SIG=147r0j223/EXP=1349825340/**http%3A//ctt.marketwire.com/%3Frelease=934348%26id=2062909%26type=1%26url=http%253a%252f%252fwww.teslamotors.com%252f">Tesla Motors</a>(  NASDAQ : TSLA ) today unveiled its highly anticipated Supercharger  network. Constructed in secret, Tesla revealed the locations of the  first six Supercharger stations, which will allow the Model S to travel  long distances with ultra fast charging throughout California, parts of  Nevada and Arizona.</p>
<p>The technology at the heart of the Supercharger was developed  internally and leverages the economies of scale of existing charging  technology already used by the Model S, enabling Tesla to create the  Supercharger device at minimal cost. The electricity used by the  Supercharger comes from a solar carport system provided by SolarCity,  which results in almost zero marginal energy cost after installation.  Combining these two factors, Tesla is able to provide Model S owners<sup>1</sup> free long distance travel indefinitely.</p>
<p>Each solar power system is designed to generate more energy from the  sun over the course of a year than is consumed by Tesla vehicles using  the Supercharger. This results in a slight net <em>positive</em> transfer of sunlight generated power back to the electricity grid. In  addition to lowering the cost of electricity, this addresses a commonly  held misunderstanding that charging an electric car simply pushes carbon  emissions to the power plant. The Supercharger system will always  generate more power from sunlight than Model S customers use for  driving. By adding even a small solar system at their home, electric car  owners can extend this same principle to local city driving too.</p>

<p>Community Power in Lewes<br />
Posted on September 10, 2012	</p>
<p>Ouse Valley Energy Supply Company, or Ovesco as it is commonly known, is a powerful inspiration for enthusiasts of community renewable energy. In August I was given a guided tour of Ovesco projects by Chris Rowland, which you can see here, and then filmed Chris explaining the origins of Ovesco and outlining some of their projects. You can view the second film here.</p>
<p>Standing on a hill above Lewes you can not only see the solar PV installations completed by Ovesco but also arrays of panels inspired by their projects. The local football club, the leisure centre and many local homes, have all followed the example of Ovesco. Other sites are looking to follow and there are also plans for community wind and hydro-electric schemes.</p>
<p>The Ovesco website is a rich source of information and links for community renewable energy projects and is well worth a visit.</p>
<p>Below is an edited version of an article on the OVESCO website.</p>
<p>Power to the people of Lewes</p>

<h1 id="pagetitle">In Canada&#8217;s Tar Sands, a Dante&#8217;s Hell Threatens People Nearby and Across the Globe</h1>
<p>In Canada&#8217;s western province of Alberta, Melina Laboucan-Massimo’s community—the <a href="http://www.lubiconlakenation.ca/">Lubicon Lake Nation</a>—has endured a withering toxic tar sands oil assault, an Armageddon against nature few Americans are fully aware of. Here in the once pristine sub-Arctic, tar sands mining operations level vast swaths of boreal forests near native lands, as <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/20/enbridge-athabasca-pipeline-alberta_n_1610705.html">pipelines burst and spew corrosive chemical-laced tar sands oil </a>into rivers and lakes.</p>
<p>The Lubicon are used to living in harmony with nature. But tar sands mining has brought a deadly discordance to their environment. Melina has watched family and friends battle unheard of cancers and respiratory ailments; she&#8217;s listened to local fishermen and hunters complain about unusual lesions and tumors festering in their catches and prey. She&#8217;s reacted in disbelief as her government has sponsored airborne sharpshooters to gun down mighty <a href="http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/eshope/killing_wolves_to_protect_cari.html">Canadian wolf packs</a>—a zero sum game that is killing one species to try to save another—as dwindling herds of caribou flee their disappearing forest homes and <a href="http://www.canada.com/business/Elevated+risk+caribou+disappearing+from+oilsands+region+memo+tells+Peter+Kent/6895756/story.html">may be gone </a> forever in the not so distant future.</p>
<p>For members of the Lubicon Lake Nation, it is a nightmare of Kafkaesque proportions. Their verdant land of abundant wildlife is metastasizing into pock-marketed battlefields of a thousand Verduns. Melina and other community leaders have not sat idly by as the environmental carnage unfolds around them. She has testified before Congress, spearheaded Greenpeace protest actions, and worked tirelessly to get the word out about the devastation in her community.</p>

<h1>Predicting the Top Sustainability Stories of 2012</h1>
<p>Last month I offered my picks for the Top Sustainability Stories of  2011. Here are my predictions for the Top Sustainability Stories of  2012. (It&#8217;s a rugged mix of bad news and good.)  <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Climate heats up and hides out</strong> The sheer pressure of the hard-to-escape evidence &#8212; more  record-breaking temperatures, more disastrous weather events, big supply  chain disruptions, ever-rising insurance payments &#8212; will drive more  businesses to take global warming seriously as a business risk, even as <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> and others blast the <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2012/01/31/415942/la-times-us-escaped-winter-global-warming-journalistic-malpractice/">journalistic</a> <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/02/climate_change_and_media">malpractice</a> that leaves &#8220;climate&#8221; out of the weather disaster stories, and President Obama takes cover in  an &#8220;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mobileweb/2012/01/26/obama-las-vegas-energy_n_1234582.html">all of the above</a>&#8221; energy strategy.  <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>US falls behind in solar</strong> China, Germany, Brazil &#8212; and California &#8212; continue to invest policy  and capital in the new economy, while Washington remains lost in  ideological shock and awe (as <a href="http://www.greenbuildinglawupdate.com/2011/12/articles/codes-and-regulations/federal/congress-restricts-leed-spending/">House republicans tell the Pentagon </a>&#8220;you  have to waste taxpayers money and make the troops less safe so we can  continue to ignore both the science and the economics of climate  change&#8221;). But there are surprises too: &#8220;red state&#8221; Iowa has decided that  exporting $6b/year to buy fossil fuel from unfriendly nations might not  be the most &#8220;conservative&#8221; plan, and is investing government money to  reduce that balance of payments deficit!</p>
<p><strong>EPA battle royal </strong> The right&#8217;s war on the EPA (and on regulation in general) will  continue, and in fact heat up as campaign fodder. Little noticed: <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/green/2011/12/15/390462/house-gop-voted-191-times-against-the-planet-earning-worst-environmental-record-of-any-congress/">191 house votes attacking the EPA in 2011</a>. Expect this battle to continue into 2013 (depending on how the elections turn out).   But there&#8217;s good news too.</p>

<p>Go there and read. More next week.</p>

<h1>Keystone XL pipeline won&#8217;t benefit American families or the environment</h1>
<h5>Published: Sunday, June 17, 2012,  5:00 AM     Updated: Sunday, June 17, 2012, 12:35 PM</h5>
<p><strong>By Emilie Winn </strong></p>
<p>As a 16-year-old high school student, I am deeply concerned about the long-term effects of the proposed <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/opinion/keystone-claptrap.html">Keystone XL pipeline</a> on my and subsequent generations. This pipeline would transport tar  sands 2,000 miles from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Producing synthetic  oil from tar sands generates around three times the amount of<a href="http://www.edithcook.com/blog-news/keystone-xl-tar-sands-pipeline-recipe-for-disaster"> greenhouse gases</a> as regular oil production. <a href="http://www.transcanada.com/keystone.html">TransCanada</a>,  the company behind the pipeline proposal, was ordered by the government  to dig up 10 sections of the Keystone I pipeline after testing showed  that the steel used was possibly defective. The company plans to use  steel from the same manufacturer for the Keystone XL pipeline. In  addition, the Keystone I pipeline has seen <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/29/keystone-pipeline-infographic_n_941069.html">12 spills in a single year</a>. The idea of this level of error at a much higher magnitude is horrifying.</p>
<p>One of the most cogent claims made about the proposed pipeline was the <a href="http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/conflicting-numbers-emotions-cloud-keystone-xl-jobs-debate/article_7d44c024-552b-11e1-9d7e-0019bb2963f4.html">number of jobs it would create</a>,  which many supporters estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands. Yet  data from the U. S. State Department and TransCanada itself has shown  the project would provide up to 6,500 jobs during production and leave  only hundreds of permanent jobs. The effect Keystone XL would have on  unemployed Americans has been largely fictionalized. For the Keystone I  pipeline in South Dakota, a shockingly low 11 percent of construction  jobs were taken by South Dakotans. The majority of jobs that such  projects create are taken by immigrants willing to do menial labor for  low pay. And the vast majority of jobs are temporary.</p>

I am returning to my google whoring headline grabbing self of 2007/2008. Yes sir, I am bored and I ain&#8217;t going to take it no more. Here are some pretty pictures of some popular places that pay several thousand dollars per household per year to do pretty simple stuff.</p>

<p>So what happens if gas prices keep going higher?</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t live in a <a href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-03-25/news/31235634_1_merriam-bike-route-trips">cities like Merriam, Kansas</a> without driving everywhere, as Maggie Koerth-Baker observes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470876255/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thebusiinsi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0470876255">Before the Lights Go Out</a>.</p>

<h1 id="page-title">Guest Blog: Corbett Foundation Mobilizes in India for Earth Day 2012</h1>
<p>5/1/12 | <a title="View user profile." href="http://www.earthday.org/user/12">Earth Day Network</a></p>
<p>Guest blog by: Zaara Kidwai</p>
<p>Between April 14 and 23, the Corbett Foundation (TCF) carried out a  series of events and activities for Earth Day 2012 in Corbett, Kutch,  Bandhavgarh and Kanha, India. We engaged schoolchildren here in a  variety of interactive seminars and competitions designed to teach them  and their communities about the importance of sustainable living and  preserving the environment.</p>
<p>Throughout the week, the Corbett office of TCF organized activities  such as environmental film screenings, presentations, health awareness  sessions and quiz competitions for 6th-10th graders in 11 schools in and  around the Corbett Tiger Reserve.</p>
<p>TCF–Kutch celebrated a one-day mega event on April 22 with children  from two schools in Bhuj: Army Public School and Matruchaya Girls  School. The event was organized in collaboration with the Gujarat Forest  Department, Kutch West Division. A total of 125 students participated  in the event, which included a screening of a film about conserving the  Great Indian Bustard followed by a drawing and poster-making  competition.</p>
<p>TCF-Bandhavgarh organized a nature walk for school children followed  by a visit to an interpretation center. They also distributed solar  lanterns to the Kulohawah village, located inside the Bandhvagrah Tiger  Reserve, and organized an exhibition of traditional crafts.</p>
<p>TCF-Kanha organized an environmental awareness rally and a roadside  clean-up in which 70 students and villagers from four villages  participated. The rally started in Manjitola village; then, participants  marched to the Mukki gate of the Kanha Park. Along the way, students  chanted slogans like “Save Earth, Save Life, One Earth, One Chance.”</p>
<p>We hope our efforts will motivate people around us to adopt an environmentally-friendly lifestyle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like I said in the beginning there are many types of people that want to be off the grid. The rich do it because they can. Many people do it to save money. Some people, like Thoreau, like the solitude or are paranoid. Then there are the survivalists. I do not agree with their theories or their ideology, but they are a part of the mix and this site is pretty explicit.</p>

<h1>Talking to Friends and Family about Prepping</h1>
<p>A number of readers have emailed me lately asking how they can convince their friends and family to start prepping.</p>
<p><strong>To be honest this is a touchy subject, one that can often make even hardcore preppers feel a bit uncomfortable. </strong></p>
<p>For some, the thought of talking to anyone about prepping fills them  with feelings of anxiety. Just the thought of others knowing what preps  you have is enough to fill anyone with a sense of paranoia . And who can  blame them, lately it seems like every time we turn on the news another  <a href="http://offgridsurvival.com/randpaulwarnsofmilitarylockingupamericancitizens/">government agency is warning people about those dangerous preppers</a>.</p>
<p><strong>For those that do try to talk about the subject, trying to  get their family and friends on board can be a headache to say the  least.</strong></p>
<p>From friends and family members that truly believe the government  will save them in a time of crisis, to those that have been brainwashed  by the media to believe that preppers are all  tinfoil hat wearing  nutjobs, prepping can often be a touchy or even taboo subject to talk  about. While we have touched on the subject in the past, I thought it  was important to take another look at how we can help those we care  about prepare for an uncertain future.</p>
<p><strong>Dealing with those who believe the Government will help them in a time of crisis.</strong></p>
<p>As a reader who recently wrote to me pointed out, 50 years of being  programmed to believe that the government can help is hard to undo. We  live in a society that is becoming increasingly reliant on the  government to help them in every aspect of their lives. In fact over 67  million Americans now rely on government aid to pay for either housing,  food, health care or education. That’s 1 in 5 Americans!</p>
<p>Most people simply don’t realize or believe that they are in any kind  of danger. Most Americans live under the belief that the government  will be there to help them in a time of crisis. <strong>So what can you do to change this mindset and protect those that you care about? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Use the Governments own advice. </strong></p>
<p>Even the government advises people to be prepared. They will be the  first to admit that during a time of crisis it’s highly unlikely that  they’ll be able to respond in under 72 hours.</p>
<p>At the very least your friends and family should be prepared to  survive at home without power, water and utilities for a minimum of 72  hours. While most of the governments advice is rather simplistic,  it  may help you introduce the subject to those who depend on the government  for everything.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>It is a huge site. Go there and read. More Tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That&#8217;s right the OIL SPILL in the Gulf of Mexico was not their fault.  You know what? Between the remediation they have done and a court of law they maybe right. Which is maybe more disgusting. The well was theirs, there is no doubt about that but with the blowpout preventer being bad, the cementing company&#8217;s cement job being bad, and the drilling platform operator being bad to dangerous, by the time they get to court (think 20 years if the Exxon Valdez is any gauge) and all three companies may actually end up owing BP money. They sure are trying to put a shiny happy face on it though.</p>

<h2 id="deck">Advertising blitz touts recovery of tourism, fishing industries after massive spill</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/?v=2&amp;where1=NEW%20ORLEANS&amp;sty=h&amp;form=msdate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NEW ORLEANS</a> — Nearly 20 months after its massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill — and just as Americans focus on New Orleans, host of the college football championship game — BP is pushing a slick nationwide public relations campaign to persuade Americans that the Gulf region has recovered.</p>
<p>BP PLC&#8217;s rosy picture of the Gulf, complete with sparkling beaches, booming businesses, smiling fishermen and waters bursting with seafood, seems a bit too rosy to many people who live there. Even if the British oil giant&#8217;s campaign helps promote the Gulf as a place where Americans should have no fear to visit and spend their money, some dismiss it as &#8220;BP propaganda.&#8221;</p>
<p>The PR blitz is part of the company&#8217;s multibillion dollar response to the Gulf oil spill that started after the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded off the coast of Louisiana on April 20, 2010, killing 11 workers and leading to the release of more than 200 million gallons (760 million liters) of oil. As engineers struggled to cap the out-of-control well, it turned into the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history.</p>
<p>Now, BP is touting evidence that the Gulf&#8217;s ecology has not been severely damaged by the spill and highlighting improving economic signs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to report that all beaches and waters are open for everyone to enjoy!&#8221; BP representative Iris Cross says in one TV spot to an upbeat soundtrack. &#8220;And the economy is showing progress, with many areas on the Gulf Coast having their best tourism season in years.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campaign, launched just before Christmas, has ramped up for the two-week period around the Sugar Bowl and Bowl Championship Series title game to be played on Monday between Louisiana State University and Alabama.</p>
<p>The company is paying chefs Emeril Lagasse and John Besh to promote Gulf seafood, it&#8217;s hired two seafood trucks to hand out fish tacos and seafood-filled jambalaya to the hundreds of thousands of tourists and fans pouring into the city for the football games and it&#8217;s spreading its messages at galas, pre-game parties and vacation giveaways.</p>

<p>More tomorrow.</p>
