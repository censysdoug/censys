										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have come to despise Joe Machin. The entire Senate turns on whether he will vote for something. He has derailed the stringent Climate Change provisions of Built Back Better bill, and acted like it was a boon that he voted for a Black Woman to the Supreme Court. He is a waste of human space. Joe Manchin helped a West Virginia power plant that is the sole customer of his private coal business. Along the way, he blocked ambitious climate action.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/08/manchin-family-coal-company-00003218">https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/08/manchin-family-coal-company-00003218</a></p>
<p>This article is from the NY Times but its tagline would not load up so I used the one above. from politico. I think if you click on the author you may get through. In fact I clicked on the active author link and it took me right through so you get 2 articles for the nonprice of 1.</p>

<p class="css-g5piaz evys1bk0">GRANT TOWN, W.Va. — On a hilltop overlooking Paw Paw Creek, 15 miles south of the Pennsylvania border, looms a fortresslike structure with a single smokestack, the only viable business in a dying Appalachian town.</p>
<p class="css-g5piaz evys1bk0">The Grant Town power plant is also the link between the coal industry and the personal finances of Joe Manchin III, the Democrat who rose through state politics to reach the United States Senate, where, through the vagaries of electoral politics, he is now <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/climate/manchin-climate-biden.html?searchResultPosition=21">the single most important figure</a> shaping the nation’s energy and climate policy.</p>
<p class="css-g5piaz evys1bk0">Mr. Manchin’s ties to the Grant Town plant date to 1987, when he had just been elected to the West Virginia Senate, a part-time job with base pay of $6,500. His family’s carpet business was struggling.</p>
<p class="css-g5piaz evys1bk0">Opportunity arrived in the form of two developers who wanted to build a power plant in Grant Town, just outside Mr. Manchin’s district. Mr. Manchin, whose grandfather went to work in the mines at age 9 and whose uncle died in a mining accident, helped the developers clear bureaucratic hurdles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If I have aired this piece before I apologized. But it is important and needs to be said again. Big Oil, Gas and Coal are the big nasty. They shit in our air, they pee in our politicians and they spit on our lawyers. They have know what they were doing pretty much all along. We should seize their assets and put their Executives in jail.</p>

<p class="dcr-s23rjr">After a century of wielding extraordinary economic and political power, America’s petroleum giants face a reckoning for driving the greatest existential threat of our lifetimes.</p>
<p class="dcr-s23rjr">An unprecedented wave of lawsuits, filed by cities and states across the US, aim to hold the oil and gas industry to account for the environmental devastation caused by fossil fuels – and covering up what they knew along the way.</p>
<p class="dcr-s23rjr">Coastal cities struggling to keep rising sea levels at bay, midwestern states watching “mega-rains” destroy crops and homes, and fishing communities losing catches to warming waters, are now demanding the oil conglomerates pay damages and take urgent action to reduce further harm from burning fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="dcr-s23rjr">But, even more strikingly, the nearly two dozen lawsuits are underpinned by accusations that the industry severely aggravated the environmental crisis with a decades-long campaign of lies and deceit to suppress warnings from their own scientists about the impact of fossil fuels on the climate a decades-long campaign of lies and deceit to suppress warnings from their own scientists about the impact of fossil fuels on the climate and dupe the American public.</p>
<p class="dcr-s23rjr">The environmentalist Bill McKibben once characterized the fossil fuel industry’s behavior as “the most consequential cover-up in US history”. And now for the first time in decades, the lawsuits chart a path toward public accountability that climate activists say has the potential to rival big tobacco’s downfall after it concealed the real dangers of smoking.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People are always asking why Nuclear Power Plants cost so much. They want to blame regulation, or safety measures. Maybe even because of unnecessary cost over runs. Mainly they do this because &#8220;They want to build more NUCLEAR Power Plants&#8221;. But the fact of the matter is you can&#8217;t build them cheaper and in fact given the costs of the 2 Major Nuclear catastrophes, maybe you need to build them more expensive. The simple fact, is that a new Coal Fired Plant can cost 2 billion dollars and kill the atmosphere while a Uranium Fired Plant could cost 4 billion dollars and kill us.</p>
<p>Anyway here is some discussion of that:</p>

<p>Should any discussion of nuclear power go on for long enough, it becomes inevitable that someone will rant that the only reason it has become unaffordable is a proliferation of safety regulations. The argument is rarely (if ever) fleshed out—no specific regulation is ever identified as problematic, and there seems to be no consideration given to the fact that we might have learned something at, say, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/05/remediating-fukushima-when-everything-goes-to-hell-you-go-back-to-basics/">Fukushima</a> that might merit addressing through regulations.</p>

<p>But there&#8217;s now a paper out that provides some empirical evidence that safety changes have contributed to the cost of building new nuclear reactors. But the study also makes clear that they&#8217;re only one of a number of factors, accounting for only a third of the soaring costs. The study also finds that, contrary to what those in the industry seem to expect, focusing on standardized designs doesn&#8217;t really help matters, as costs continued to grow as more of a given reactor design was built.</p>
<h2>More of the same</h2>
<p>The analysis, done by a team of researchers at MIT, is remarkably comprehensive. For many nuclear plants, they have detailed construction records, broken out by which building different materials and labor went to, and how much each of them cost. There&#8217;s also a detailed record of safety regulations and when they were instituted relative to construction. Finally, they&#8217;ve also brought in the patent applications filed by the companies who designed the reactors. The documents describe the motivations for design changes and the problems those changes were intended to solve.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why? Because I am tired, pessimistic and it all seems so repetitive. I am also extremely disappointed. I am disappointed in myself, my friends, my State, my Nation, and hell even my enemies. WE HAD A CHANCE to stop this thing. We had the science and even the modeling on our side and yet we failed. We misjudged the power it would take and i think we totally misunderstood the violence it would take to stop the carbon industry from continuing to sell their products. We should have elected a President who wasopposed to fossil fuels 10 &#8211; 15 years ago. We should have blown up gas stations and power plants 10 &#8211; 15 years ago. Here we are looking at a 3 Degree uptick in temperature which will kill off all but the very hardy species. We act like there is still hope. We act like there is a future. Well I am done with that.</p>

<p data-elm-loc="1">A northeastern Siberian town is likely to have set a record for the highest temperature documented in the Arctic Circle, with a reading of 100.4 degrees (38 Celsius) recorded Saturday in Verkhoyansk, north of the Arctic Circle and about 3,000 miles east of Moscow. Records at that location have been kept since 1885.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="2">If verified, this would be the northernmost 100-degree reading ever observed, and the highest temperature on record in the Arctic, a region that is warming at more than twice the rate of the rest of the globe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald J. Trump is the worst energy President of all time. That takes a lot of doing. Jimmie Carter was real bad on Nuclear Power. George Bush was seriously bad on natural gas and oil. But this alleged policy maker pledged, during the the 2016 campaign, that he would SAVE coal. Under his Presidency the Coal Market has plummeted as has its usage. Even though foreign markets were promised, they have plunged too. Oil futures at one point were trading in negative territory for the first time ever and Nuclear Power Plants are closing. He is opposed to Wind and Solar as they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFHh0Rs34v0">spread across the land</a>. I have a wind turbine within 15 minutes of my house in Riverton and I have a house with total roof solar panels around the corner from me. That says to me that the Cheeto Burito is about to lose office. We shall see.</p>

<p>MARION — Southern Illinois Power Cooperative plans to retire its largest coal-fired generator as early as this fall, a move that is expected to save $125 million over a decade.</p>
</div>
<div class="lee-article-text">
<p>President and CEO Don Gulley said the tentative decision is the result of analysis and negotiations that have been ongoing since late 2019. Gulley said SIPC utilized outside consultants to help it perform a comprehensive review of operations and determine the best path forward. The decision to close Unit 4, as it is known, was based on two primary factors, he said: sustained low energy prices in the wholesale power market, and increasingly costly environmental regulations for coal-fired generators.</p>

<p>As a result, up to 26 of the plant’s 82 employees are expected to face layoffs. Those employees are to receive a severance package under the terms of an agreement ratified by the IBEW Local 702, which represents workers, Gulley said.</p>

<p>As governments around the globe debate how to respond both to the coronavirus itself and the economic chaos it has unleashed, a theme that’s come up over and over is how to prioritize what makes it into spending packages. In the United States, right-left fault lines have emerged over the question of bailing out emissions-heavy industries versus <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/156903/golden-opportunity-green-stimulus">a greener stimulus</a>. On Thursday, the Environmental Protection Agency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/climate/epa-coronavirus-pollution-rules.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">announced</a> a large-scale rollback of environmental regulations as a response to the pandemic—allowing many emitters to police themselves when it comes to pollution.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615338/coronavirus-emissions-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">some argue</a> that the oxygen in the climate debate should be taken up by the pandemic instead, the two issues aren’t mutually exclusive, experts say. In a warming climate, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/155746/climate-change-already-hurting-kids-health">more diseases are likely to emerge and spread</a>, making climate change action an important part of addressing future health crises. Moreover, the perception that climate change isn’t as urgent as other crises may rely on misunderstandings about how climate-related changes will happen. The rate isn’t constant: Instead, there’s reason to believe everything from Arctic melt to Amazon deforestation might experience what’s known as “tipping points,” where small changes in nature shift into rapid and irreversible damage.</p>
<p>Greenland and Antarctica are melting six times faster than they were in the 1990s, according to a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/greenland-antarctica-melting-six-times-faster-than-in-the-1990s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">new study</a> in the journal <i>Nature.</i> Between 1992 and 2017, Greenland and Antarctica lost 6.4 trillion tons of ice. This falls under the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/chapter/summary-for-policymakers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">worst-case scenario</a> projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the effects are already being felt in many parts of the world. The IPCC predicts that by the end of the century, 400 million people around the globe could be at risk of coastal flooding every year from sea-level rise alone.</p>

<p>DRAKESBORO, Ky. (AP) — President Donald Trump tried to stop it from happening. The top Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, did too.</p>
<p>Despite their best efforts to make good on Trump’s campaign promise to save the beleaguered coal industry, including an eleventh-hour pressure campaign, the Tennessee Valley Authority power plant at Paradise burned its last load of coal last month.</p>
<p>The plant&#8217;s closure — in a county that once mined more coal than any other in the nation — is emblematic of the industry&#8217;s decadeslong decline due to tougher environmental regulations, a major push toward renewable energy and a rise in the extraction of natural gas. The shuttering of businesses nationwide and a reduced need for energy amid the global <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://apnews.com/d1ddda5b644a9cdd6b844a196377b88e" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ylk="slk:coronavirus">coronavirus </a>pandemic threatens to deal coal yet another devastating blow.</p>
<p>“It’s not just one 1,000-megawatt unit closing; they’re going down all over the place,” said John Rogers, a former mine owner who lives in western Kentucky near the Paradise plant, located in Muhlenberg County.</p>
<p>When coal-burning plants close, coal mining loses its best customer. Since 2010, 500 coal-burning units, or boilers, at power plants have been shut down and nearly half the nation&#8217;s coal mines have closed. No U.S. energy company, big or small, is building a new coal-burning plant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Only speculated on several years ago. Feedback Loops are things that speed up or slow down climate change. The two that concern us here are the most obvious, clouds and ice shrinkage. The more water in the atmosphere the more clouds and the hotter the earth &#8211; the more water. But the killer one is, ice is very very reflective. What replaces it it is not and in the case of &#8220;dark&#8221; water, it is incredibly absorptive. The question has always been when would they kick in? I always said we would know when it was too late. Here we are.</p>

<h1 class="full-width-image-lede-text-below__hed">Climate Models Are Running Red Hot, and Scientists Don’t Know Why</h1>
<div class="full-width-image-lede-text-below__dek">
<p>The simulators used to forecast warming have suddenly started giving us less time.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-width-image-lede-text-below__byline">By</div>
<div class="full-width-image-lede-text-below__times"><time class="article-timestamp" datetime="2020-02-03T10:00:14.648Z" data-type="updated" data-status="localized">February 3, 2020, 4:00 AM CST</time></div>
<p class="section-break">There are dozens of climate models, and for decades they’ve agreed on what it would take to heat the planet by about 3° Celsius. It’s an outcome that would be disastrous—flooded cities, agricultural failures, deadly heat—but there’s been a grim steadiness in the consensus among these complicated climate simulations.</p>
<p>Then last year, unnoticed in plain view, some of the models started running very hot. The scientists who hone these systems used the same assumptions about greenhouse-gas emissions as before and came back with far worse outcomes. Some produced projections in excess of 5°C, a nightmare scenario.</p>
<div class="hardwall" data-position="2">
<p>The scientists involved couldn’t agree on why—or if the results should be trusted. Climatologists began “talking to each other like, ‘What’d you get?’, ‘What’d you get?’” said Andrew Gettelman, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, which builds a high-profile climate model.</p>
<p>“The question is whether they’ve overshot,” said Mark Zelinka, staff scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  Researchers are starting to put together a­nswers, a task that will take months at best, and there’s not yet agreement on how to interpret the hotter results. The reason for worry is that these same models have successfully projected global warming for a half century. Their output continues to frame all major scientific, policy and private-sector climate goals and debates, including the sixth encyclopedic assessment by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change due out next year. If the same amount of climate pollution will bring faster warming than previously thought, humanity would have less time to avoid the worst impacts.</p>
