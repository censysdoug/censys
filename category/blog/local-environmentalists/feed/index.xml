<p>Youth Climate Strike</p>
<p>March 15, 2019</p>
<p>(Pictures Below!)</p>
<p>While the government and a majority of the adults piss away the future reveling in their short-term goals and lives, the youth are protesting and striking the prospects of a very bleak future left as legacy by mainly the powers that be who have ignored the climate crisis for over 50 years.  Scientists world-wide have warned us and warned us that now we have only about 11 years left to truly embark on a road to zero carbon emissions because of the very real threat of global warming, death to species and oceans, and permafrost melting, leading to the release of many ancient diseases and the heat up of the atmosphere leading to crop failure, sea level rise, and billions of deaths in our near future and a collapse of the ecosystem that supports all life on this planet.</p>
<p>What the youth demand is at least a Green New Deal or an honest effort by the leaders to truly take on the problem of global warming.  The need to do so has never been more urgent.  There are also some among us adults that stand with our youth and are in solidarity with their efforts to strike from going to school until the leaders listen to the truly educated.</p>

<p>As cities grow and incomes rise around the world, more and more people are leaving gardens and traditional diets behind and eating refined sugars, refined fats, oils and resource- and land-intense agricultural products like beef. This global dietary transition is harming the health of both people and the planet, says new research.</p>
<p>But the study also shows that shifting away from this trajectory and choosing healthier traditional Mediterranean, pescatarian or vegetarian diets could not only boost human lifespans and quality of life, but also slash emissions and save habitat for endangered species.</p>
<p>And we better hurry; the scientists project that if the trend continues, the situation will be worse yet with greenhouse gas emissions up by 80 percent by 2050.</p>
<p>Examining almost 50 years’ worth of data from the world’s 100 most populous countries, University of Minnesota Professor of Ecology G. David Tilman and graduate student Michael Clark illustrate how current diet trends are contributing to ever-rising agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and habitat degradation.</p>
<p>On top of that, they write: “These dietary shifts are greatly increasing the incidence of Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and other chronic non-communicable diseases that lower global life expectancies.”</p>

<h1>City of Springfield touts second lake as potential backup for region, including Chatham</h1>

<blockquote><p>Springfield officials are emphasizing to permitting agencies that the city’s long-proposed backup water supply, Hunter Lake, could serve the entire region during a severe drought.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Mayor Jim Langfelder and other city officials met last week with representatives from the three agencies that Springfield needs permit approval from before the second lake could be built.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“If a drought hit, we’d be a regional source of water,” Langfelder said Monday.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Langfelder and Ted Meckes, City Water, Light and Power’s water division manager, met with representatives from the Army Corps of Engineers, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, following the Springfield City Council’s reaffirmation vote in July of a commitment to move forward with the Hunter Lake projec</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes I am a Headline Whore. But this is a very real nitty gritty get your hands dirty post. Most of the posts here are about environmental theories, or solar power writ large. But many environmental issues involve a compost pile and turning them, or washing off crud from recyclables. In this case if you have grass, and live in town you have to cut it. That means you have maintenance things to attend to. So here they are.</p>

</div>
</section>
<p>Following the <strong>lawn tractor maintenance</strong> advice in your tractor’s manual is the best way to keep it humming along smoothly. But owner’s manuals usually only tell you basically what to do and when to do it—they seldom include the tips and real-world wisdom gained through experience. So we asked veteran mechanics which steps are the most important and how to make <strong>lawn tractor maintenance and tubeless tire repair</strong> faster and easier.</p>
<p>You’ll save too. Dealers typically charge more than $200 for routine maintenance that includes an oil change and new spark plugs and filters. But you can do all these things—and more—in just a few hours. A <strong>lawn tractor maintenance</strong> kit from your dealer (less than $75) might cost a few bucks more than buying parts separately but ensures that you get all the right stuff. And new tubes for a <strong>tubeless tire</strong> repair cost from $5 &#8211; $15.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Sangamon River is a major untapped resource for tourism, recreation and Abraham Lincoln history in the region.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>A just-completed state study of an 85-mile section from Petersburg to Decatur also concluded the river is in need of a major image upgrade, including acknowledgement of the role it played in the life of Lincoln, improved boat access, bike and hiking trails, more public facilities, scenic driving routes, conservation incentives, and stepped-up efforts to reduce fly dumping.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Public presentation of the report — “Lincoln Heritage Water Trail” — at a policy breakfast of the Citizens Club of Springfield on Friday is timed to the 50th anniversary in 2015 of the Lincoln Heritage Canoe Trail.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Gov. Otto Kerner approved creation of the original 65-mile river trail in 1965</p></blockquote>

<h1>Petersburg school nominated for solar energy program</h1>
<div class="byLine"><span>Dan Petrella</span> <span class="timestamp">06/18/2013 &#8211; 11:22 PM EDT</span></div>
<p>PETERSBURG — The PORTA School District could soon add more solar power to its alternative energy <a id="itxthook0" class="itxtnewhook itxthook" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; border: 0px none transparent; padding: 0px; background-color: transparent; background-image: none; display: inline;" href="http://business-news.thestreet.com/sj-r/story/petersburg-school-nominated-solar-energy-program/1#" rel="nofollow"><span id="itxthook0w" class="itxtrst itxtrstspan itxtnowrap itxtnewhookspan" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; text-decoration: underline ! important; border-width: 0px 0px 1px; border-style: none none solid; border-color: transparent transparent #00cc00; padding: 0px 0px 1px ! important; color: #009900; background-color: transparent;">portfolio</span></a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to a wind turbine, solar panels and geothermal heating installed in 2009 at PORTA High School, the district has been saving about $350,000 a year in energy costs, School Superintendent Matt Brue said.</p>
<p>Now, a former student who works for Joule Solar Energy in New Orleans has nominated PORTA Central School for a program that aims to bring solar panels to schools through crowdfunding</p>
<p>Oakland, Calif.-based Mosaic offers an online platform for individuals to <a id="itxthook1" class="itxtnewhook itxthook" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; border: 0px none transparent; padding: 0px; background-color: transparent; background-image: none; display: inline;" href="http://business-news.thestreet.com/sj-r/story/petersburg-school-nominated-solar-energy-program/1#" rel="nofollow"><span id="itxthook1w" class="itxtrst itxtrstspan itxtnowrap itxtnewhookspan" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; text-decoration: underline ! important; border-width: 0px 0px 1px; border-style: none none solid; border-color: transparent transparent #00cc00; padding: 0px 0px 1px ! important; color: #009900; background-color: transparent;">invest</span></a> in solar projects.</p>
<p>When Bob O’Hara received an email from Mosaic saying that the company was looking for schools to work with, he thought of PORTA Central.</p>
<p>O’Hara, 29, attended PORTA schools through eighth grade before enrolling at Sacred Heart-Griffin High School in Springfield. He moved to New Orleans after graduating in 2002 to attend Tulane University, but he still visits his parents in Petersburg regularly.</p>
<p>He likes to check out the wind turbine at the high school on his visits and thought PORTA Central would be a good candidate for solar panels because of its long, south-facing roofline.</p>
<p>O’Hara said he also knows the district has been facing budget cuts due to dwindling state funding.</p>
<p>“One way to be able to invest in a school is to help them with their energy costs,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got an email from Southern Illinois that said 30 big rigs had rolled through town yesterday morning. I figure that that is enough for 2 wells. It seems like some drilling company has decided to &#8220;go for it&#8221;. Which makes sick and disgusting sense. Many of the leases die at the end of April. I suspect that these will be test wells, because no one knows what is down there. It takes about  7 days to to drill a well and frack it. That would have the wells beginning to come in as the lease expires. This is what I said in print.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>FRACKING STINKS</strong></span></p>
<p>I am <a id="FALINK_2_0_1" href="http://www.illinoistimes.com/Springfield/article-11240-letters-to-the-editor-4_11_13.html#">writing</a> to argue for a moratorium against fracking in Illinois (SB 1418). Chicago environmentalists argue that “fracking is going to happen anyway.” That is a total capitulation to the industry. The bill that the environmentalists endorse (HB2615) is amazing in the things it does not prevent. It does not force the frackers to recycle their water, allows for methane flaring, allows wells within 300 feet of water sources, allows wells within 500 feet of a house, does not allow adequate testing of produced waters especially for radiation and then allows that waste to be deep well injected and finally allows for the state to overrule counties and municipalities who do not want fracking or more protective measures.</p>
<p>Many states have tried to establish hydraulic fracturing regulations that would allow the industry to drill safely. The problem is regulations do not work. The industry always violates the regulations and when caught pays the fine as part of standard operating procedure. These violations include injecting radioactive water underground, open pit storage of fracking and waste waters even where not permitted, the production of toxic fumes and the sickening of residents, well water contamination and the direct dumping of toxic water into springs and streams. They have gone so far as to sell toxic water to county townships to suppress dust in the summer and to de-ice roads in the winter as if that was safe. Homeowners are duped into selling mineral rights without being told that it will make their houses impossible to sell and wreck their mortgages. In Pennsylvania their violations include:</p>
<p>&#8211; 224 violations of “failure to properly store, transport, process or dispose of residual waste.”</p>
<p>&#8211; 143 violations of “discharge of pollutional material to the waters of Commonwealth.”</p>
<p>&#8211; 140 violations of “pit and tanks not constructed with sufficient capacity to contain pollutional substances.”</p>
<p>This does not include the actual damage that they do to the environment, like damaging the roads where they work, and flaring the natural gas that should be harnessed as a fuel source and the constant noise pollution that the above activities produce. I was visiting a friend in Colorado when such a well was put in and the noise and smell alone were enough to sicken me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sierra Club has drifted pretty far from John Muir&#8217;s roots. They signed a deal with Clorox about 10 years ago. I mean it is unclear when exactly because they keep the terms of the deal ultra secret. Anyway the rough outlines of the deal is that Clorox created a &#8220;green&#8221; cleaning supplies line and the Sierra Club gets a chunk (percentage) of the sales profits from that line. The deal must have obviously been that the Sierra Club get off the companies back about chlorine. So now, when they offer stuff to join for a year, and that stuff is good enough, I join.  Other than that I just cost them junk mail fees.</p>

<h3><a href="http://sierraclub.typepad.com/michaelbrune/2012/09/wind-energy-shepherds-flat-oregon.html">Mighty Wind</a></h3>
<h2>09/28/2012</h2>
<h2>Did you notice that last weekend <a href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/22/wind-sprints-to-the-cliff/">the largest onshore wind farm in America started operation in north-central Oregon</a>? The 845 MW Shepherds Flat facility will generate an estimated 2 billion kWh each year &#8212; enough to power 235,000 homes. On top of that, this clean power will eliminate about 1.5 million metric tons of carbon pollution annually &#8212; the equivalent of taking approximately 260,000 cars off the road.</h2>
<p>Who built Shepherds Flat? We, the people, did! Caithness Energy relied on more than a billion dollars in loans guaranteed by the Energy Department. With the project up and running, and with a long-term commitment from Southern California Edison to buy power, it looks like a good investment. Maybe that&#8217;s why Google also kicked in $100 million.</p>
<p>Shepherds Flat is the kind of project we should be building across the U.S. &#8212; or at least in those parts, like the Eastern Columbia River Gorge, with abundant wind resources. Yet the Republican Party opposes even extending the Production Tax Credit that wind power has had for decades. Right now, they would probably sooner move Burning Man to the National Mall than help finance more success stories like Shepherds Flat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First on the list of actual green active organizations is Greenpeace. As with most activist organizations, I like them or I hate them based on their actions. When they challenge the whalers, I applaud. When they unroll banners from bridges over the Mississippi River or chain themselves up in trees, I must admit I become embarrassed. I have never been a member needless to say.</p>

<h2>Happy whales have sanctuaries</h2>
<p><a href="http://greenpeaceblogs.org/2012/10/03/happy-whales-have-sanctuaries/"><img decoding="async" alt="" src="http://greenpeaceblogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GP049Q1-2.jpg" /></a><br />
My Greenpeace colleagues aboard the <em>Rainbow Warrior</em> in the Indian Ocean shared a heartwarming experience when a frolicking group of humpback and minke whales put on quite a show. It&#8217;s not a stretch to say these whales were happy and playful. Why wouldn&#8217;t they be as the entire Indian Ocean is a whale sanctuary where they can live in peace? What a contrast this is to other parts of the world where whales not only don&#8217;t have protections but face a myriad of direct threats from humans. One huge emerging threat to whales, dolphins and other marine wildlife is happening now in the coastal waters of California. <a href="http://greenpeaceblogs.org/2012/10/03/happy-whales-have-sanctuaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more</a></p>
