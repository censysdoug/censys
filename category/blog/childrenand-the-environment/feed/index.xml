										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The predictions were: &#8220;Russia will be in Kyiv in hours&#8221;, &#8220;Putin will replace Ukrainian President with puppet&#8221;,  &#8220;Russia&#8217;s Air Force will crush Ukraine&#8221;, &#8220;Attacked on 4 sides Ukraine will surrender&#8221;.  To that Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians said  NYET! With just 78 planes in the air and Tanks running out of fuel the Russian attack appears uncoordinated and without passion. There are even rumors of Russian Units laying down their guns. In part here is why. Think about Brazil attacking Spain.</p>

<p>Russia&#8217;s economy is &#8220;incredibly unimportant in the global economy except for oil and gas,&#8221; Jason Furman, a Harvard economist and former advisor to President Barack Obama, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/21/business/economy/ukraine-russia-economy.html?smid=tw-share" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="3833ffc99460c6de181a669dc35eb096">The New York Times.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s basically a big gas station,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His comments come as the West prepares <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/21/statement-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-on-russian-announcement-on-eastern-ukraine/" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="7bd2d70c52d7b2017ceccb055122336e">heavy sanctions</a> on Russia if it invades Ukraine. While they have the potential to throw the Russian economy into chaos, these measures could also reverberate to further damage the US, Europe, and the rest of the world as they battle inflation and rising energy prices — a ripple effect that the West hopes to mitigate.</p>
<p>On Monday, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/map-where-are-donetsk-luhansk-ukraine-russia-2022-2" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="f1a4c149a6bb8c3977ad89ca46bfbafb">Moscow declared the independence of two breakaway regions of Ukraine and sent troops there</a> — escalating the prospect of a major war. President Joe Biden has already <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-orders-sanctions-russia-backed-eastern-ukraine-separatist-regions-2022-2" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="bf7125005aab9537167f85ca2b703e20">ordered sanctions</a> on the separatist regions — Donetsk and Luhansk — prohibiting US citizens from engaging in any exports, imports, or new investments in these areas.</p>
<p>Despite Russia&#8217;s size and wealth in raw materials, its economy is more on par with Brazil than with nations like Germany, France, and the UK, <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?most_recent_value_desc=false" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="60" data-uri="8081f643505061a94e157a69ddaf0bbb">according to the latest nominal GDP data from the World Bank.</a> According to the World Bank, Russia&#8217;s economy is smaller than Italy&#8217;s and South Korea&#8217;s, two nations with less than half of Russia&#8217;s population.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MACC doesn&#8217;t sound nearly as good as MADD but I suppose it could always work. I mean mothers are a potent source of social change. However, it took 100 years for them to get the vote and we do not have 100 years. I guess if my Grandma, Mable Ross, had started such a movement we would be in pretty good shape now. It also seems like a pretty &#8220;white&#8221; movement. I suppose that is where you have to start. GOOD LUCK LADIES!</p>

<p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">Three years ago, I had a baby. I won’t go into the details, but suffice it to say that she is extremely cute, and I enjoy being her mother. A few months after her birth, I was scrolling on my phone, and I came across news of a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It described a future world that will have experienced 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming. In this world, the oceans are acidifying, and most coral reefs have been bleached to death; hundreds of millions of people face severe drought, and even more face deadly heat waves. The kicker? This planet—the 1.5-degree-warmer one—was the best-case scenario. Scientists were using the report to <a class="external-link" href="https://www.wri.org/blog/2018/10/half-degree-and-world-apart-difference-climate-impacts-between-15-c-and-2-c-warming" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.wri.org/blog/2018/10/half-degree-and-world-apart-difference-climate-impacts-between-15-c-and-2-c-warming&quot;}">argue</a> that we should try to shoot for that. The Paris climate accord aims to limit the global-temperature increase to “below 2 degrees Celsius.” At present, both goals seem like a stretch. According <a class="external-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/02/26/un-climate-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/02/26/un-climate-emissions/&quot;}">to the U.N.</a>, all of the world’s current pledges would only cut carbon emissions by one per cent—a far cry from the nearly fifty per cent needed this decade in order to meet our goals. So, 1.5 degrees is coming. According to <a class="external-link" href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-when-might-the-world-exceed-1-5c-and-2c-of-global-warming" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-when-might-the-world-exceed-1-5c-and-2c-of-global-warming&quot;}">some researchers</a>, we could get there around 2030, when my daughter will be entering middle school.</p>
<p class="paywall">I did some further Googling: What will the world look like when she’s middle-aged? When her <em>children</em> are middle-aged? I found a <a class="external-link" href="https://climate-life-events.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://climate-life-events.herokuapp.com/&quot;}">Web site</a> that lets you plot major events in your child’s life against the projected global-temperature increase. Even <a class="external-link" href="https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/&quot;}">the “optimistic” scenarios</a> show the world warming two degrees during her lifetime. The more realistic scenarios—the ones based on what countries are actually doing to reduce emissions, not what they’ve pledged—show it heating up to three degrees. There is a universe of difference between those numbers, but they are <a class="external-link" href="https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/impacts-climate-change-one-point-five-degrees-two-degrees/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/impacts-climate-change-one-point-five-degrees-two-degrees/&quot;}">both awful</a>, bringing rising seas, heat waves, food and water shortages, wildfires, droughts, and hurricanes, not to mention the loss of biodiversity. Naturally, this line of research prompted a nervous breakdown. I had always understood, intellectually, that climate change was an existential threat, but it was only after my daughter’s birth that it became real to me.</p>
<p class="paywall">I’m not alone. According to the <a class="external-link" href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/global-warmings-six-americas-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/global-warmings-six-americas-in-2020/&quot;}">Yale Program on Climate Change Communications</a>, twenty-six per cent of Americans report feeling “alarmed” about climate change, up from less than half that number six years ago. About the same number of people describe themselves as “concerned”—which seems like the way you should feel about your child’s “Animal Crossing” addiction, not the fact that the Thwaites Glacier could slide into the ocean during his lifetime, flooding coastal cities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems really weird that we all started out on bikes after horses and before cars were really affordable. There was a real love affair with bikes in the modern urban environment around the 1900s. Especially women who had never been allowed to get about. Bikes came on strong before mores or laws could be erected (so to speak) and women just went bonkers. Now every envirofreak (no offense intended) wants to go back to them. We shall see. We shall see.</p>

<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">HEIDELBERG, Germany — Eckart Würzner, a mayor on a mission to make his city emission free, is not terribly impressed by promises from <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/business/general-motors-electric-cars.html">General Motors</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/ford-says-it-will-phase-out-gasoline-powered-vehicles-in-europe.html">Ford</a> and other big automakers to swear off fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Not that Mr. Würzner, the mayor of Heidelberg, is against electric cars. The postcard-perfect city, in southern Germany, gives residents who buy a battery-powered vehicle a bonus of up to 1,000 euros, or $1,200. They get another €1,000 if they install a charging station.</p>
<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">But electric cars are low on the list of tools that Mr. Würzner is using to try to cut Heidelberg’s impact on the climate, an effort that has given the city, home to Germany’s oldest university and an 800-year-old castle ruin, a reputation as a pioneer in environmentally conscious urban planning.</p>

<p><strong>P</strong>resident-elect Joe Biden has an unprecedented opportunity to walk the U.S.—and perhaps the world—back from the brink on climate change. After four years of harmful deregulation, his work is cut out for him.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 icxCgE">But to truly address climate change will require more than simply repealing President Donald Trump’s rollbacks and maybe strengthening a few rules on power plant emissions before calling it a day. Because climate change is an everything problem, the entire and considerable weight of the federal government will need to be thrown into addressing it. Like rowing competition, the race to address climate change can only be won if everyone is pulling in the same direction.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 icxCgE">This “all of government” response to the crisis at hand is the only way to ensure a shot at keeping the globe from heating up more than the 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) goal outlined in the Paris Agreement, to say nothing of the 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) target outlined in a <a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 kVnoAv js_link" href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/we-have-a-decade-to-prevent-a-total-climate-disaster-1829585748" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://earther.gizmodo.com/we-have-a-decade-to-prevent-a-total-climate-disaster-1829585748&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]">landmark United Nations report</a>. Over the next four years, Biden will have to center climate change at every agency, from the obvious ones like the Environmental Protection Agency to others like the Department of Education and Treasury.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 icxCgE">Earther has pulled together ideas and actions federal agencies can take to address climate change, based on conversations with dozens of experts who know the federal government’s levers of power and how to pull them so that they’re all geared to lower emissions. The ideas below are not exhaustive nor do they include solutions that can be applied at all agencies such as installing climate advocates at all levels, using procurement to electrify the government vehicle fleet, and diversifying the workforce so that new problem solvers are welcomed into the fold. But they do represent some of the best ones out there for how to get the ship turned quickly.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and rejoice. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little house for me is 800 square feet. That&#8217;s what my wife and I have if you discount the storage space and the plant room in the basement. During the spring, summer, and fall months, we spend a lot of time outdoors in are yard or up until March doing other things in other spaces. Whether its an apartment or a rental house, that&#8217;s pretty much the way I have always been. Whether there were one of me or two of us.</p>
<p>The idea that small is better has always seemed to be suspect to me. Anyway, here is one take on the down side of a Tiny House. And yes, I still believe Small is Beautiful.</p>

<p class="body">Tiny houses are everywhere. They’ve received heavy <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2018/04/03/small-but-not-tiny-homes/484295002/">coverage</a> in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jun/26/tiny-home-communities-housing-solution-or-gentrified-trailer-parks">the media</a> and there are <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tinyhousemovement/?hl=en">millions</a> of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tinyhouse/?hl=en">followers</a> on dozens of pages on social media. While there is no census for these homes, they have seen a surge in popularity in the decade since the Great Recession – witness the <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/article/tiny-house-maker-legacy-housing-sets-terms-for-41-million-ipo-cm1063239">prolific growth</a> of tiny house manufacturers, for instance. Originating in the US, tiny homes have also been popping up across Canada, Australia and <a href="http://www.tinyhouseuk.co.uk/">the UK</a>.</p>
<p class="body">Tiny houses are promoted as <a href="https://theconversation.com/tiny-houses-the-big-idea-that-could-take-some-heat-out-of-the-housing-crisis-77295">an answer</a> to the affordable housing crisis; a desirable alternative to traditional homes and mortgages. Yet there are many complexities and contradictions that surround these tiny spaces, as I discovered when I began investigating them.</p>
<p class="body">I have toured homes, attended tiny house festivals, stayed in a tiny house community and interviewed several dozen people who live inside them. My research took me throughout the US, from a converted accessory unit squeezed between two average size homes on Staten Island to a community in Florida full of cute and brightly coloured tiny structures – appropriately located just down the road from Disney World. Here are three things I unexpectedly discovered along the way.</p>

<p>I am sure there are thousands of people that are happy with their Tiny Houses. Go there and read. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chernobyl and Fukushima released a lot of radiation. People died from the severe radiation released just after the accident, but &#8220;mild&#8221; consistent radiation is not dangerous to animals though it may have mild effects on adults and bigger effects on children. But the idea that a major radiation release would create one eyed giant humans or fire breathing dragons like wadzzilla is really remote. The fear of radiation has done some pretty amazing things for the environment, however.</p>

Once thought to be forever uninhabitable, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has become a haven for flora and fauna that prove that life, as they say in <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/49904/20-things-you-might-not-have-known-about-jurassic-park" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Jurassic Park</em></a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/oijEsqT2QKQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finds a way</a>.</p>
<h2 class="body title">1. The Animals of Chernobyl Survived Against All Odds</h2>
<p class="body">The effects of the radioactive explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on April 26, 1986 devastated the environment. Around the plant and in the nearby city of Pripyat in Ukraine, the Chernobyl disaster’s radiation caused the leaves of thousands of trees to turn a rust color, giving a new name to the surrounding woods—the <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/56235-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-33-years-later-wildlife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Forest</a>. Workers eventually bulldozed and buried the radioactive trees. Squads of Soviet conscripts also were ordered to <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-happened-to-the-dogs-of-chernobyl-the-harrowing-events-of-the-tv-series-are-sadly-true-17928470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoot</a> any stray animals within the 1000-square-mile Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Though experts today believe parts of the zone will remain unsafe for humans for another <a href="https://www.livescience.com/39961-chernobyl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20,000 years</a>, numerous animal and plant species not only survived, but thrived.</p>
<h2 class="body title">2. Bears and Wolves Outnumber Humans Around the Chernobyl Disaster Site</h2>
<p class="body">While humans are strictly prohibited from living in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, many other species have settled there. Brown bears, wolves, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/33677/canada-lynx-ghost-cat-north" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">lynx</a>, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59248/whats-difference-between-bison-and-buffalo" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">bison</a>, deer, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59461/10-gigantic-facts-about-moose" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">moose</a>, beavers, foxes, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64760/10-resourceful-facts-about-badgers" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">badgers</a>, wild boar, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/70797/12-surprising-facts-about-raccoon-dogs" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">raccoon dogs</a>, and more than 200 species of birds have formed their own ecosystem within the Chernobyl disaster area. Along with the larger animals, a variety of amphibians, fish, worms, and bacteria makes the unpopulated environment their home.</p>

With the Pandemic and all the doom coming out of the environmental community I thought I would say, &#8220;We can do things together&#8221;! The place to start is small. Ride your bike. Recycle and reduce your garbage. Compost. Walk places when you can. Take the steps not the elevator. I do all of those things and everyday I try to think of more things I can do.

<p class="has-drop-cap">Three years ago, Kim Cobb was feeling “completely overwhelmed” by the problem of climate change. Cobb spends her days studying climate change as director of the Global Change Program at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, but she felt paralyzed over how to be part of the solution in her personal life. The barriers felt immense.</p>
<p>She decided to start small. On January 1, 2017, she made a personal climate resolution: She would walk her kids to school and bicycle to work two days a week. That change didn’t represent a lot in terms of carbon emissions, she says, “but it was a huge lesson in daily engagement.”</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the beginning, her modest goal seemed daunting, but she quickly discovered that the two simple activities nourished her physical and mental well-being. She wanted to do them every day. “It’s no longer for the carbon — it’s for the fact that I genuinely love riding my bike and walking my kids to school,” she says. And that made her wonder: What other steps was she thinking of as sacrifices that might actually enrich her life?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are people that live their lives to right environmental wrongs. Then there are people who live their lives according environmental principles. Sometimes the two meet in a happy medium. Then there are people who over do it. To those people I say stop. (no exclamation mark) Don&#8217;t be vegetarian to &#8220;save the planet&#8221;. It will not. Don&#8217;t have children to make the &#8220;world a better place&#8221;. It will not. Do those things if they make you feel good and you will have a better life. But if you want to have 3 kids- and you can love them and afford them,  then do that thing.</p>

<div class="c-byline"><span class="c-byline-wrapper"> By <span class="c-byline__item"> <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/sigal-samuel" data-analytics-link="author-name"><span class="c-byline__author-name">Sigal Samuel</span></a> </span> <span class="c-byline__item"> <time class="c-byline__item" datetime="2020-02-13T13:10:00" data-ui="timestamp"> Feb 13, 2020, 8:10am EST </time> </span> </span></div>
<p id="hfRdc2">A growing contingent of young people are refusing to have kids — or are considering having fewer kids — because of climate change. Their voices have been growing louder over the past year. UK women set up a movement called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/12/birthstrikers-meet-the-women-who-refuse-to-have-children-until-climate-change-ends">BirthStrike</a>, announcing that they won’t procreate until the world gets its act together on climate, and high-profile US figures like <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/3/11/18256166/climate-change-having-kids">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> amplified the question of whether childbearing is still morally acceptable.</p>
<p id="WjhJHS">One of the main worries cited by this contingent is that having a child will make climate change worse. Their logic is that anytime you have a kid you’re doing something bad for the planet. You’re adding yet another person who’ll cause more carbon emissions, plus their children, plus their grandchildren &#8230; and so on, in a never-ending cascade of procreative shame.</p>
<p id="J8RdRy">Driving this logic are <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541">studies</a> claiming to show that having a child leads to a gargantuan amount of carbon emissions — way, way more than the emissions generated by other lifestyle choices, like driving a car or eating meat. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children">Media reports</a> have trumpeted the takeaway that if you want to fight climate change, having fewer children is far and away the best thing you can do.</p>
<p>But that’s just not true, according to <a href="https://founderspledge.com/stories/climate-and-lifestyle-report">a new report</a> by Founders Pledge, an organization that guides entrepreneurs committed to donating a portion of their proceeds to effective charities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is kinda funny because my blog is an accumulator blog and these guys are the maximum accumulators. Having lived in New Orleans for 12 years you can smell it, you can taste and there are days when you just should stay inside. Then there is the urban detritus, it rained 110 inches one year and the flooding was horrid. Walking through the water everyday I faced motor oil, gasoline and even used syringes.</p>

<div class="introduction">
<p>The petrochemical industry has grown in Louisiana, with more plants on the way, but the state’s environmental regulations haven’t kept up.</p>

<h2 class="hed">How Oil Companies Avoided Environmental Accountability After 10.8 Million Gallons Spilled</h2>
<p class="dek">Louisiana still hasn’t finished investigating 540 oil spills after Hurricane Katrina. The state is likely leaving millions of dollars in remediation fines on the table — money that environmental groups say they need as storms get stronger.</p>

But it was substantial.</p>
