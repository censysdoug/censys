<p id="yui_3_18_0_3_1544737098564_2503">(Reuters) &#8211; U.S. solar installations fell 15 percent in the third quarter as the Trump administration&#8217;s tariffs on overseas-made panels forced developers to put off large projects, according to a report commissioned by the industry&#8217;s primary trade group.</p>
<p>Current weakness in the utility-scale market, however, will be offset by larger volumes of projects than had been expected over the next five years because solar energy is now cheaper than ever, the report said.</p>
<p>Quarterly installations of utility-scale solar were 678 megawatts, the lowest quarter since 2015 and a more than 30 percent decline from a year ago, the report by Wood Mackenzie for the U.S. Solar Energy Industries Association said. The total market, which includes residential and commercial installations, came in at 1.7 gigawatts.</p>
<p>The slowdown is a shift for solar, which has experienced runaway gains in the last decade. Through the first three quarters of the year, solar accounted for 30 percent of electricity generating capacity additions.</p>

<p class="content__segment combx">Duke Energy Corp. expects to spend $500 million over the next 15 years installing more than 300 megawatts worth of storage batteries on its Carolinas grid.</p>
<p class="content__segment combx">Charlotte-based Duke (NYSE: DUK) released the estimate Wednesday morning, days after <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/news/2018/10/09/duke-energy-proposes-solar-plus-storage-project.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposing its first microgrid project </a>— including a two-megawatt solar farm and a four-megawatt storage battery — for residential and business customers. That will serve the remote mountain town of Hot Springs, on the North Carolina-Tennessee border north of Asheville.</p>
<p class="content__segment combx">Duke says it plans to expand the use of batteries beyond storing and dispatching of energy. Its long-range plan includes deploying batteries for other purposes such as system balancing, increasing reliability of “end of the line” power supplies and to defer other traditional grid upgrades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been at a loss for words for the last month. Things are going so well. I know Dotard is still President and many things are seriously messed up. But on the alternative energy front things just keep getting better and better. Don Blankenship actually made a fool out of himself and lost a primary vote for the Senate in West Virginia. Next week I may even get to report that Yucca Mountain is open for business. But for now, California hits one out of the park.</p>

<p data-page="1">California regulators on Wednesday mandated that all newly built single family houses have solar panels, part of the state&#8217;s aggressive push to combat climate change.</p>
</div>

<div class="card collection-item" data-type="text">
<div class=" card-content ">
<p>The California Energy Commission voted 5-0 to approve the measure, which also applies to multifamily buildings of three stories or fewer. The mandate is set to take effect in 2020 and does not need the approval of the Legislature.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card collection-item" data-type="text">
<div class=" card-content ">
<p>The requirement is expected to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-solar-panels-homes-20180508-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">save consumers</a> money in the long run through reduced utility bills, but also make a new house more expensive to purchase at a time many families already struggle to afford a mortgage.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card collection-item" data-type="text">
<div class=" card-content ">
<p>In addition to the solar mandate, the commission approved new insulation and air filter requirements for newly built homes. In all, the new residential requirements are expected to make a single-family house $9,500 more expensive to build on average, but save $19,000 in reduced utility bills over a 30-year period, according to the Energy Commission.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia has a plan to wean its economy off oil. In the biggest sign of what the future of the Gulf state would look like, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, has signed a memorandum of understanding with Japanese multinational Softbank to build 200 GW of solar power by 2030 at a cost of $200 billion.</p>
<p>These are eye-popping numbers. If built, that solar-power plant will be about 200 times the size of the biggest solar plant operating today. It would more than triple Saudi Arabia’s capacity to produce electricity, from about 77 GW today.</p>
<p>With current technology, solar panels capable of generating 200 GW would likely cover 5,000 sq km—an area larger than the the world’s largest cities.</p>

<p>&#8220;Families are starting to move into what is being called America&#8217;s first solar-powered town,&#8221; announces <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/sexual-misconduct/john-dickerson-replaces-charlie-rose-cbs-morning-n836096" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Dickerson</a> for CBS This Morning on Jan. 16. &#8220;<a href="https://www.babcockranch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Babcock Ranch</a>, about half an hour northeast of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Myers,_Florida" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fort Myers,</a> Florida, is supposed to produce more energy than it consumes once it&#8217;s finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>Developer <a href="http://kitsonpartners.com/executive-team/sydney-kitson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syd Kitson</a> is building 20,000 homes for a projected 50,000 people, states Dickerson in the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/inside-floridas-solar-powered-babcock-ranch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newscast video </a>accompanying the article.</p>
<blockquote><p>There are more than 300,000 solar panels spread across 440 acres there, producing enough electricity not only for the town, but also the surrounding areas, reports CBS News&#8217; <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/team/manuel-bojorquez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manuel Bojorquez</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>One critical energy element lacking in the solar-powered community will be adequate energy storage to allow the city to be truly self-powered:</p>
<blockquote><p>The town doesn&#8217;t run on solar power all the time. At night, when the sun is down, it has to draw from the traditional electrical grid. Kitson says the technology for storing all that surplus energy the solar cells generate during the day is still too costly.</p></blockquote>

<p>Renault has launched a &#8220;smart island&#8221; in Portugal that uses its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/23/renault-zoe-impressions-ev-charging-network-paris-france/#/">Zoe electric vehicle</a>, home batteries, smart charging and vehicle-to-grid (V2E) energy storage to run without fossil fuels. The idea is to make the Madeira island of Porto Santo energy independent and stimulate renewable energy production. &#8220;[We want] to build a model that can be carried over to other islands and cities,&#8221; Renault Electric Vehicle Director Eric Feunteun told Engadget.</p>

<p>Unlike Tesla&#8217;s massive Powerpack installation, the Renault project is more of a community endeavor on the small (16 square mile) and sparsely populated (5,483 inhabitants), tourism-oriented island. It will unroll in three phases: In the first, 20 fortunate Porto Santo volunteers will get 14 Zoes and six Kango Z.E. utility vans to use every day. They&#8217;ll benefit from 40 new connected public and private charging stations set up by Renault and local utility Empresa de Electricitade da Madeira (EEM).</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s say you come home from work at 7 PM with a decent charge left, and only need two to three hours of charging,&#8221; said Feunteun. &#8220;The smart charging system we&#8217;re testing will decide when the best time to do that is, based on usage, energy availability and other factors. Then, it can charge up to eight times a day in chunks as small as 15 minutes.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I agreed to publish this here because it is such a different perspective then the one I have or CES has. We tend to blame builders for not just serving up top notch energy efficient residences. Then there is the issue of retrofitting. As always this is no endorsement of Ryan or his Real Estate firm. Believe me I have no intention of buying a home in Alaska.</p>

More buyers see the value of it, and more builders and sellers are starting to make changes in that direction. There is still a long way to go before energy efficiency and reducing waste becomes the standard for new homes and improved existing homes, but a larger pool of buyers demanding these features can help move the needle bit by bit.</div>

<div id="article-description">The Swiss voted on Sunday in favour of a massive overhaul of the country&#8217;s energy system by gradually replacing the power from its ageing nuclear reactors with renewable sources.</div>
<div id="article-body">
<div>A full 58.2 percent of Swiss voters supported the shift, according to a final tally after Sunday&#8217;s referendum, with only four of the country&#8217;s 26 cantons voting &#8220;no&#8221;.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;This is a historic day for the country,&#8221; Green Party parliamentarian Adele Thorens Goumaz told public broadcaster RTS.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;Switzerland will finally enter into the 21st century when it comes to energy.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The move has been in the making since shortly after Japan&#8217;s Fukushima nuclear plant was destroyed in the March 2011 tsunami disaster, when the Swiss government decided to gradually close its nuclear plants.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Instead, it aims to increase reliance on hydraulic power as well as renewables like solar, wind, geothermal and biomass.</div>

<div class="meta grey">By Ahmed Megahid, The Arab Weekly   |   May 15, 2017 at 10:33 AM</div>
<p><span class="story_dl">CAIRO, May 15 (UPI) &#8212;</span> The vista in the central province of Minya is as empty as far as the eye can see except for rows and rows of solar panels and the blue sky above.</p>
<p>The panels are helping Amr al-Saad&#8217;s 8-month-old power sta­tion address the worsening issue of brownouts and blackouts in the area.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few years ago, power supply was intermittent, which made the life of the residents of the province very tough,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is why I decided to establish my project where it is most needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>After generating electricity, Saad&#8217;s station feeds it into the na­tional grid where it is used to power houses, farms and workshops in Minya&#8217;s villages.</p>
<p>Saad&#8217;s project, which cost $100,000 and produces 650 kilo­watts of electricity each month, is part of a national drive to reduce Egypt&#8217;s dependence on fossil fuels by shifting to renewable energy. Egypt plans to produce 20 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2022 and 37 percent by 2035. It is an ambitious plan given that just 3 percent of electricity produced annually in Egypt today is from renewable sources.</p>

</div>
<div class="entry">
<p>After doing some research on renewable energy systems or alternative energy systems as many will call them, I wanted to get the information out there as far as the advantages and disadvantages of the 2 main renewable energy systems, <a title="wind turbine generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind turbine generators</a> and <a title="photovoltaic solar panels" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">photovoltaic solar panels</a>.</p>
<p>Both <a title="solar panel" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panel</a> and <a title="wind generator systems" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator systems</a> are similar as far as how they are setup. You can have the <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> grid tied or off grid, same as <a title="solar panels" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panels</a>. Both the <a title="solar panel photovoltaic panel" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panel (photovoltaic panel)</a> and <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> will need a battery bank if you are using an off grid system. Both of these renewable energy systems will produce clean energy and help the environment as well as save you money in your home!</p>
<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Wind Generator Systems and Solar Panel Systems</h3>
<p>Now onto some of the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative energy system. None of this information is from my own personal experience as I do not have the financial funds to support the research. So the information about these renewable energy systems have came from researching the internet, talking to people that have these alternative energy systems, and of course some calculations of my own (prices, efficiency, etc.).</p>
<h3>Wind Turbine Generator System Pros and Cons</h3>
<p>The main advantage of <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> is that they can produce electricity day or night as long as there is wind. <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">Wind generators</a> need less space on your land to produce sufficient electricity. <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">Wind generators</a> are able to produce more electric for the same price. If you spend $1,000.00 on <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> you can produce 1kW – 2kW, with <a title="solar panels" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panels</a> you may only produce around .5kW – .75kW with the same $1,000.00. <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generators" target="_blank">Wind generators</a> have moving parts, so there is always wear and tear on these moving parts. Bearings can go bad, propeller blades can be struck by objects, and heat may be generated. Your <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> will be installed on a tower or pole of some sort to gain height where there is more wind, allowing lighting to possibly strike your <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a>. As wind hits the propeller blades there will be noise created, think of a fan and how they sound, or even taking a rope and swinging it fast in circles. You will get some of this noise from your <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a>. The propellers of the <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> can also produce shadows flickering. Birds can get killed from flying into your wind generator’s propellers. There are vertical <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generators</a> which will prevent this. So the quick break down of the <a title="wind generator system" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator system</a>:</p>
