<h2 class="post__deck">Small backyard houses get a lot of attention as a solution to the housing crisis, but it’s a different idea in theory than it is when you try to put it into practice.</h2>

<p>When I moved from Brooklyn back to the Bay Area a few years ago, I thought, at first, that the apartment I found was charming. It’s also very small: At the end of a long driveway, inside a former garage, it’s 240 square feet, or roughly the size of one and a half parking spaces.</p>
</div>
</article>
<p>I still live there—partly because rents in Oakland have surged <a href="https://sf.curbed.com/2018/1/30/16950444/bay-area-rent-san-francisco-oakland-san-jose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than 50%</a> in less than a decade, and in a neighborhood where a typical one-bedroom now goes for more than $2,800, I can’t afford to move. I recognize the value of this type of tiny house, called an accessory dwelling unit or ADU, in theory. In built-up cities with little extra land and residents who fight development, adding tiny cottages in backyards is one way to help address the housing shortage. The small size saves energy and curbs my shopping habits, since there literally isn’t any room for, say, another pair of shoes. But I also question how well tiny homes make sense as a solution for long-term housing—and in some cases, as in the even tinier houses sometimes used as housing for people experiencing homelessness, I wonder if they can sometimes distract from other, more systemic solutions that are necessary.</p>
<p>As tiny houses go, mine is larger than some. One nearby shed-like cottage currently for rent on Craigslist is 120 square feet; another, which rents for $1,600 a month, is 200 square feet. A few miles away from me, a village of 8-by-10-foot tiny houses on wheels is under construction for homeless youth, with a separate communal kitchen and communal bathrooms. Hundreds of others are currently living on the street in much tighter quarters in vehicles or tents. While there’s no official definition for a tiny house, they’re generally said to be around 500 or fewer square feet, making my place somewhat medium-size as far as tiny houses go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was electricity from coal before there was gasoline driven cars. Still they are a big part of the problem. As other people have pointed out we are literally forced to drive. That is not to overlook the damage that big ocean ships and airplanes. I mean, Coal, Oil, Hot Asphalt and kerosene are the Big Four of Death.</p>
<p>Still it is hard to deny the seduction of the gasoline internal combustion engine. I got my first one when i was 14. It was a 90 cc Honda Motorcycle and it meant freedom to me. I could go from small town to small town in central Illinois. Meet new people, make new friends for a Quarter (.25$) per Gallon of gas. In fact I met my first true love who was riding a dirt bike on a back road blacktop, on the Honda.</p>
<p>How was I to know how dangerous they are, and that does not include the ones killed by operating them.</p>

<p>The summer I was eighteen, I visited a parking lot forty-five minutes north of town and got behind the wheel for what I hoped would be the first real rite of my adulthood. I was tall, gangly, excitable. Less than a week earlier, following a brief stretch of test-taking at the Department of Motor Vehicles in San Francisco, I had received my learner’s permit. Learning in those days seemed easy. Tests were easy. Doing—when the matter arose at all—was hard. Behind the wheel, I made a show of adjusting the mirrors, as if preparing for a ten-mile journey in reverse. I surveyed the blank pavement ahead of me and slowly slid the gear-shift from park into drive.</p>
<p>Cars had been my first passion. As a two-year-old, I’d learned to recognize the make of vehicles by the logo near the fender or perched on the hood. I grew to understand the people in my life according to their cars; I learned what sort of person <em class="">I</em> was from my parents’ two old Hondas, one of which, a used beige Accord, I had gone with them to buy. My father’s lingering bachelor vehicle, a rotting yellow Civic, needed to be choked awake on dewy mornings, and I’d performed that job with relish, pulling out the knob beside the steering wheel, waiting a long moment, and pushing it back. This was the late eighties. Gas prices had fallen, and the roads were knotty with cars from across the world. I no longer remember what, as a small child, I envisaged for my future, but I know that it involved moving at speed behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Now, all those years later, the parking lot was virtually empty of cars, and I felt a flush of reassurance. I was learning in my parents’ highly defatigable ride, a minivan with an all-plastic interior and the turning radius of a dump truck. My teacher was my father, a flawless but not wholly valiant driver, who habitually refused to drive on certain bridges in certain directions, for fear of being, as he would put it, “hypnotized” by trusses passing alongside the road. For reasons lost to time, my little sister was on board, too, in the back. I eased my foot onto the gas; the engine revved for a moment, and the van lurched.</p>

<p id="4P0Orz">An <a href="https://www.cbeci.org/">online tool</a> that launched this week called the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, or CBECI, estimates how much energy is needed to maintain the Bitcoin network in real time, before using this to calculate its annual energy usage.</p>
<p id="W8bxrR">Currently, the CBECI says the global Bitcoin network is consuming more than seven gigwatts of electricity. Over the course of a year that’s equal to around 64 TWh or terawatt hours of energy consumption. That’s more than the country of Switzerland uses over the same time period (58 TWh per year), but less than Colombia (68 TWh per year).</p>

<p>The utility struck a deal with environmental and labor groups in the Upper Midwest that will allow it to reduce its carbon emissions while easing job losses related to coal plant retirements.</p>

<p>Xcel Energy <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xcel-energy-end-coal-upper-154800947.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">plans to close</a> its last two coal-fired power plants in Minnesota by 2030, a decade earlier than scheduled, while keeping its nuclear power plants running through at least 2040 — the latest step in the eight-state utility’s plan to reach <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/xcel-commits-to-100-carbon-free-electricity-by-20501#gs.d6nxos">100 percent carbon-free</a> electricity by 2050.</p>
<p>The proposed early closures are part of its Upper Midwest Energy Plan, which Xcel expects to submit to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission in July. If approved, it will allow Xcel to cut its carbon emissions in the state by 80 percent compared to 2005 levels. That’s a key metric from Xcel’s <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/xcel-commits-to-100-carbon-free-electricity-by-20501#gs.d6nxos">companywide zero-carbon</a> goals announced in December, up from its previous target of 60 percent reduction from 2005 levels by 2030.</p>
<p>Monday’s announcement comes as part of a settlement agreement with environmental and labor groups, meant both to boost clean energy alternatives and help ease the job and economic losses when the Allen S. King coal power plant in Bayport, Minnesota closes by 2028 and the Sherco 3 coal-fired generator in Becker, Minnesota closes by 2030.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Xcel would proceed with plans to buy the Mankato Energy Center natural-gas plant. But its plans to build a new natural-gas power plant, as well as extend the operating license of its Monticello nuclear plant past its 2030 expiration until at least 2040, are being opposed by some environmental groups.</p>

<p data-elm-loc="1">The round-the-clock security detail for Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt cost taxpayers almost $3.5 million during his first year in office, according to figures <a href="https://www.epa.gov/foia/administrators-security-detail-quarterly-payroll-costs">published</a> Friday by the agency.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="2">The EPA spent more than $2.7 million on agents’ salaries and roughly $760,00 on travel costs as part of that coverage, records released under the Freedom of Information Act show. The amount is <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-05/documents/psd_quarterly_payroll_costs_beginning_fy_2009_-_rev5-14-2018.pdf">nearly double</a> what taxpayers paid annually on average to provide security for Pruitt’s two immediate predecessors, Gina McCarthy and Lisa Jackson, during their tenures.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="3">Pruitt received 24-7 protection <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/05/14/scott-pruitt-requested-and-received-247-security-starting-on-his-first-day-at-epa/?utm_term=.2db5ee94f456">starting on his first day</a>, according to documents released earlier this month by the EPA’s inspector general. Then-senior White House adviser Don Benton first ordered the round-the-clock detail on Feb. 12 out of concern that President Trump’s controversial policies could make Pruitt a target, emails obtained by The Washington Post show, and then Pruitt opted to maintain that level of protection</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the years I have gotten 100s of requests to post links with other Blogs and Internet Sites that are related to the things that I post about; Sometimes tangentially. Sometimes very tangentially. Below I am going to try to post some of those with the text of the request where applicable or sometimes just the link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am only one guy by the way. That is it, Community Energy Systems and Energy Tough Love is just one guy with 900 bucks in the bank&#8230;.so there is no way I can track down each post of mine and put the link on the page. Did I mention I was 63 years old. I would be dead by the time i did 10 or 20 post. Is some of this sarcastic? Well yah. But I never mean it spitefully. Please laugh with me not at me. Consider this:</p>
<p>Hello ,</p>
<p>My name is James Giraldo and I’m the Communications Manager on SaveOnEnergy.com®.</p>
<p>I wanted to point out this page: <a href="/?m=200810" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">censys.org</a> which links to a broken kids energy page on <a href="http://www.miamisci.org/af/sln/frankenstein/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">miamisci.org</a></p>
<p>Our team has created a <a href="https://www.saveonenergy.com/kids-learning-center/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kids Learning Center</a> which is filled with free resources similar to the ones previously found on that page. Please take a look, and if you find any of the content useful consider linking to it on your page, or perhaps use it to replace the broken link so your visitors don&#8217;t end up on that broken page.</p>
<p>Here is a hyperlink to our kids learning center:<br />
<a href="https://www.saveonenergy.com/kids-learning-center/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.saveonenergy.com/kids-learning-center/</a></p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your help and attention. Please let me know if you have questions or concerns that I can assist with.</p>
<p>James G.<br />
Communications Director<br />
6860 North Dallas Parkway, Suite 228 | Plano, TX 75024<br />
<a href="mailto:James@admin.saveonenergy.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">James@admin.saveonenergy.com</a><br />
www.saveonenergy.com</p>
<p>Or this:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Hi censys.org,</span></p>
<p>I was reading a page on your site and I noticed you had link pointing to a page that is broken (no longer valid) which I thought you might want to fix.</p>
<p>The broken link can be found at the middle of the page.  The page that has the broken link is:</p>
<p><a href="/index.php?s=energy&amp;paged=27" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">/index.php?s=energy&amp;paged=27</a></p>
<p>Attached is a screenshot with a circle around the broken link to make it easier to find.</p>
<p>Having broken links on your site isn’t good for your readers and also Google lowers your ranking score if you have them.  It would be awesome if you could replace the broken link with one of our related posts instead, if not, that is okay.</p>
<p><span class="u_b en_0 C4_Z2aVTcY" data-test-id="message-from"><span class="D_F rtlI_rtlI_dz_sSg "><span class="u_N C_Z1VRpVF"><a href="http:www.businesselectric.com">http:www.businesselectric.com</a></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
If you would replace it with our link we would share the post with 14,000+ followers in our niche.  We are up for collaborating more with you or negotiating more about it.</span></p>
<p>Thanks for reading my email and have a nice day ?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Oliver</p>
<p>Or this:</p>
<div>We recently put together an in-depth resource (~10K words) about work boots, which received over 1000 social shares. It&#8217;s quite different to the other articles you see on the web about this topic.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been at a loss for words for the last month. Things are going so well. I know Dotard is still President and many things are seriously messed up. But on the alternative energy front things just keep getting better and better. Don Blankenship actually made a fool out of himself and lost a primary vote for the Senate in West Virginia. Next week I may even get to report that Yucca Mountain is open for business. But for now, California hits one out of the park.</p>

<p data-page="1">California regulators on Wednesday mandated that all newly built single family houses have solar panels, part of the state&#8217;s aggressive push to combat climate change.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card collection-item" data-type="text">
<div class=" card-content ">
<p>The California Energy Commission voted 5-0 to approve the measure, which also applies to multifamily buildings of three stories or fewer. The mandate is set to take effect in 2020 and does not need the approval of the Legislature.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card collection-item" data-type="text">
<div class=" card-content ">
<p>The requirement is expected to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-solar-panels-homes-20180508-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">save consumers</a> money in the long run through reduced utility bills, but also make a new house more expensive to purchase at a time many families already struggle to afford a mortgage.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card collection-item" data-type="text">
<div class=" card-content ">
<p>In addition to the solar mandate, the commission approved new insulation and air filter requirements for newly built homes. In all, the new residential requirements are expected to make a single-family house $9,500 more expensive to build on average, but save $19,000 in reduced utility bills over a 30-year period, according to the Energy Commission.</p>

<p>On Saturday, power corporation FirstEnergy placed its coal and nuclear generation units <a href="https://cms.arstechnica.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=226681&amp;action=edit">under chapter 11 bankruptcy</a>. Although coal and nuclear plants across the country have struggled to compete with the low prices of natural gas, FirstEnergy&#8217;s filing is unique because it stands to take on a political dimension. Just two days before FirstEnergy&#8217;s bankruptcy filing, the company petitioned the Department of Energy (DOE) for an emergency bailout, <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/firstenergy-asks-doe-for-emergency-action-to-save-pjm-coal-nuke-plants/520280/">citing concerns about reliability</a>.</p>

<p>The petition could reinvigorate a debate started by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/energy-secretary-proposes-rule-to-make-grid-managers-favor-coal-nuclear/">proposed a rule</a> last year to change how coal and nuclear plants are compensated for their power. The rule was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/federal-regulator-denies-rick-perrys-proposal-to-compensate-coal-nuclear/">denied by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> (FERC), which said that there was not enough evidence to justify changing how coal and nuclear are compensated.</p>
<p>FirstEnergy disparaged FERC&#8217;s decision in <a href="https://statepowerproject.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/fes-202c-application.pdf">its Thursday petition</a> (PDF), claiming that &#8220;as a result of FERC’s and the RTO&#8217;s [Regional Transmission Organization&#8217;s] failure to address this crisis, swift and decisive action is needed <em>now</em> to address this imminent loss of nuclear and coal-fired baseload generation and the threat to the electric grid that this loss poses&#8221; (emphasis FirstEnergy&#8217;s).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a short article, but when you consider his company launched Heavy Falcon this week as well, it has been a very good year for Elon. It is just getting started.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/73140-tesla-massive-100mw-south-australian-battery-putting-big.html">https://www.techspot.com/news/73140-tesla-massive-100mw-south-australian-battery-putting-big.html</a></p>
<h1 class="large">Tesla&#8217;s massive 100MW South Australian battery is putting a big dent in &#8216;gas cartel&#8217; profits</h1>
<h2>Tesla&#8217;s battery is significantly undercutting traditional &#8216;gas cartel&#8217; energy charges</h2>
<p><em> By <a href="https://www.techspot.com/community/staff/polycount.403116/" rel="author">Cohen Coberly</a> <time datetime="2018-02-06 16:02:00-0500"> <span title="2018-02-06 16:02:00">on Feb 6, 2018, 4:02 PM</span> </time></em></p>
<p>Back in March, Tesla boss Elon Musk promised to provide South Australia with a 100MW battery to help the state make the switch to more affordable, renewable energy. At the time, he promised to get the project done in under 100 days or give it to them for free &#8211; more than living up to his promise, Tesla <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/72125-south-australia-switches-tesla-100mw-battery-largest-lithium.html">finished the battery installation</a> in only 63 days.</p>
<p>After officially being switched on in December, the battery has gone on to save South Australia millions of dollars. It&#8217;s accomplished this by easing some of the burden associated with high FCAS costs.</p>
<p>For the unaware, FCAS (frequency control and ancillary services) charges are costs the Australian Energy Market Operator must pay when they ask energy companies to contribute some of their network services to the government in the case of scheduled maintenance or energy system faults.</p>
