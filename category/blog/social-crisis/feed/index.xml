<p><span class="smartbody__lead-in">As the world’s</span> largest industrial project, the scale of Alberta’s tar sands operations is hard to grasp. Imagine driving on a highway and to either side behind a thin screen of trees is a vast industrial landscape as far as the eye can see. Now imagine 500 miles of that highway.</p>
</div>
<div class="parbase smartbody section text">
<p>If Alberta, with its population of four million people, was a country it would be the fifth largest oil producing nation. While it produces conventional oil, most comes from the Alberta oil sands, the world’s third largest proven oil reserve at 170 billion barrels.</p>
</div>
<div class="parbase smartbody section text">
<p>The local and national Canadian governments are pushing to expand oil extraction operations in the vast tar sands region, which already has a footprint roughly the size of England, even as they promote action on climate change on the world stage. And although the relationships between local people and the extraction operations are complex, involving jobs and services, a growing chorus of environmentalists and indigenous people are speaking out against pollution and degradation in the oil sands. Many are digging in for a fight against proposed expansions, including a major pipeline project.</p>

<p>Honduran environmentalist leader and winner of the 2015 Goldman Environmental Prize Berta Caceres has been shot dead at her home in the town of La Esperanza.</p>
<p>Caceres was killed early on Thursday by two assailants who broke into her home, a member of her group, the Indian Council of People&#8217;s Organizations of Honduras, said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honduras has lost a brave and committed social activist,&#8221; fellow activist Tomas Membreno said in a statement.</p>
<p>Caceres, a mother of four, led opposition to a proposed dam on the Gualcarque river, considered sacred by the Lencas.</p>
<p>She had previously complained of receiving death threats from police, soldiers and local landowners because of her work.</p>
<p>Activist Carlos Reyes described the assassination &#8220;a political crime by the government&#8221;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/532896/discarded-laptop-batteries-keep-the-lights-on/">http://www.technologyreview.com/news/532896/discarded-laptop-batteries-keep-the-lights-on/</a></p>
<h1>Discarded Laptop Batteries Keep the Lights On</h1>
<p class="intro">Millions of batteries discarded with computers have more than enough life to power home lighting for one year, researchers in India say.</p>
<ul class="byline">
<li>By <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/contributor/david-talbot/">David Talbot</a> on December 3, 2014</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the estimated 50 million lithium-ion laptop batteries discarded every year could provide electricity storage sufficient to light homes in poor countries, researchers at IBM say.</p>
<p>In work being aired this week at a <a href="http://acmdev.org/" target="0" rel="noopener">conference</a> in San Jose, researchers at IBM Research India in Bangalore found that at least 70 percent of all discarded batteries have enough life left to power an LED light at least four hours a day for a year.</p>
<p>While it’s possible to combine LED lights with solar panels and rechargeable batteries (see “<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/lists/innovators-under-35/2013/humanitarian/evans-wadongo/" target="0" rel="noopener">Innovators Under 35: Evans Wadongo</a>”), using discarded batteries could make the approach far cheaper.</p>
<p>“The most costly component in these systems is often the battery,” says Vikas Chandan, a research scientist at the lab’s Smarter Energy Group, who led the <a href="http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/%7Emjain/UrJar-DEV-2014.pdf" target="0" rel="noopener">project</a>. “In this case, the most expensive part of your storage solution is coming from trash.”</p>

<div id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1386443855601_4832">Comment:  Plugging a well alone costs more than $50,000. In the study “Who Pays the Cost of Fracking?: Weak Bonding Rules for Oil and Gas Drilling Leave the Public At Risk”, PennEnvironment Research &amp; Policy Center reported documented instances in which fracking wells have cost $700,000 or more to plug.  What is the motivation for the operator to not simply forfeit the bond when they shut down?  Furthermore, drilling companies typically frack a string of wells and not just one.  If they are cutting corners, using improper well-casings for example, or not sealing them correctly, the violation is likely to occur at each site.  One $500,000 bond for perhaps as many as 100 -150 well sites is as unacceptable as a $50,000 for one well site.</div>

<div id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1386443855601_4849">If the purpose of the bond is to protect the state from expenses incurred from an accident or violation, then the bond must be sufficient to cover those occurrences.  It makes no sense to offer a blanket bond—like some bargain basement &#8220;buy 2 pairs of socks and get a third pair free&#8221;.  Each well should be bonded individually and in the amount necessary to cover real and imagined damages as outlined by the PennEnvironment study.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First on the list of actual green active organizations is Greenpeace. As with most activist organizations, I like them or I hate them based on their actions.

<h2>Happy whales have sanctuaries</h2>
<p><a href="http://greenpeaceblogs.org/2012/10/03/happy-whales-have-sanctuaries/"><img decoding="async" alt="" src="http://greenpeaceblogs.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/GP049Q1-2.jpg" /></a><br />
My Greenpeace colleagues aboard the <em>Rainbow Warrior</em> in the Indian Ocean shared a heartwarming experience when a frolicking group of humpback and minke whales put on quite a show. It&#8217;s not a stretch to say these whales were happy and playful. Why wouldn&#8217;t they be as the entire Indian Ocean is a whale sanctuary where they can live in peace? What a contrast this is to other parts of the world where whales not only don&#8217;t have protections but face a myriad of direct threats from humans. One huge emerging threat to whales, dolphins and other marine wildlife is happening now in the coastal waters of California. <a href="http://greenpeaceblogs.org/2012/10/03/happy-whales-have-sanctuaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more</a></p>

<h1>Drought eases in U.S. Midwest, worsens in northern Plains</h1>
<div id="articleInfo">
<p>By Karl Plume</p>
<p>Thu Aug 30, 2012 9:30pm IST</p>
</div>
<p>(Reuters) &#8211; The worst U.S. drought in a half century loosened its grip on the Midwest in the past week, helped by rain and cooler temperatures, but the drought grew more dire in the northern Plains, a report from climate experts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>But the improved Midwest weather arrived too late for crops in major farm states such as Kansas, Iowa, Illinois and Indiana, where severe corn and soybean yield losses have already been realized.</p>
<p>The portion of the contiguous United States suffering from at least &#8220;severe&#8221; drought fell to 42.34 percent from 44.03 percent over the prior week, according to the Drought Monitor, a weekly synthesis representing a consensus climatologists.</p>
<p>The percentage of the Midwest in that category slipped to 49.96 from 51.06 the previous week, with the most notable improvement in Indiana, 64.07 percent of which was under severe drought or worse, down from 81.48 percent a week ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was proposed in 2009 so I imagine it is operational by now. I found this amazing document that I need to look at more, but it is a listing of all the large solar facilities maybe in the world? Anyway if you want to see cool photos go to the site because pictures are a pain.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/abengoa/">http://www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/abengoa/</a></p>
<h3>General Description of Project</h3>
<p>On August 10, 2009, Abengoa Solar Inc., the sole member of Mojave Solar  LLC, filed an Application For Certification (AFC) for its Abengoa Mojave  Solar Project. The proposed project is a nominal 250 megawatt (MW) solar electric  generating facility to be located near Harper Dry Lake in an  unincorporated area of San Bernardino County. The project would be located approximately halfway between Barstow, CA  and Kramer Junction, CA, and is approximately nine miles northwest of  Hinkley, CA.</p>
<p>The project will implement well-established parabolic trough technology  to solar heat a heat transfer fluid (HTF).   This hot HTF will generate steam in solar steam generators, which will  expand through a steam turbine generator to produce electrical power  from twin, independently-operable solar fields, each feeding a 125-MW  power island.   The sun will provide 100 percent of the power supplied to the project  through solar-thermal collectors; no supplementary fossil-based energy  source (like natural gas) is proposed for electrical power production.</p>

<h1>Predicting the Top Sustainability Stories of 2012</h1>
<p>Last month I offered my picks for the Top Sustainability Stories of  2011. Here are my predictions for the Top Sustainability Stories of  2012. (It&#8217;s a rugged mix of bad news and good.)  <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Climate heats up and hides out</strong> The sheer pressure of the hard-to-escape evidence &#8212; more  record-breaking temperatures, more disastrous weather events, big supply  chain disruptions, ever-rising insurance payments &#8212; will drive more  businesses to take global warming seriously as a business risk, even as <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> and others blast the <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2012/01/31/415942/la-times-us-escaped-winter-global-warming-journalistic-malpractice/">journalistic</a> <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/02/climate_change_and_media">malpractice</a> that leaves &#8220;climate&#8221; out of the weather disaster stories, and President Obama takes cover in  an &#8220;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mobileweb/2012/01/26/obama-las-vegas-energy_n_1234582.html">all of the above</a>&#8221; energy strategy.  <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>US falls behind in solar</strong> China, Germany, Brazil &#8212; and California &#8212; continue to invest policy  and capital in the new economy, while Washington remains lost in  ideological shock and awe (as <a href="http://www.greenbuildinglawupdate.com/2011/12/articles/codes-and-regulations/federal/congress-restricts-leed-spending/">House republicans tell the Pentagon </a>&#8220;you  have to waste taxpayers money and make the troops less safe so we can  continue to ignore both the science and the economics of climate  change&#8221;). But there are surprises too: &#8220;red state&#8221; Iowa has decided that  exporting $6b/year to buy fossil fuel from unfriendly nations might not  be the most &#8220;conservative&#8221; plan, and is investing government money to  reduce that balance of payments deficit!</p>
<p><strong>EPA battle royal </strong> The right&#8217;s war on the EPA (and on regulation in general) will  continue, and in fact heat up as campaign fodder. Little noticed: <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/green/2011/12/15/390462/house-gop-voted-191-times-against-the-planet-earning-worst-environmental-record-of-any-congress/">191 house votes attacking the EPA in 2011</a>. Expect this battle to continue into 2013 (depending on how the elections turn out).   But there&#8217;s good news too.</p>
