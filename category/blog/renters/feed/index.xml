<p>Intended to create affordable housing for singles in New York City, those promised prefabricated affordable units are finally being assembled in the Brooklyn Navy Yard and will be unveiled this spring in Manhattan&#8217;s Kips Bay, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/realestate/micro-apartments-tiny-homes-prefabricated-in-brooklyn.html?_r=1#">according to The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>The city&#8217;s first &#8220;micro&#8221; building will have 55 rental apartments, all ranging from 260- to 360-square-feet with big windows, ample storage space, and Juliet balconies.</p>
<p>Because the architects believed amenities are important to micro-unit dwellers, the building will also have a public meeting space, café, and common rooftop garden for residents, as well as a laundry room, residential storage space, a bike room, and fitness space.</p>

<h2>10 Tips to Save Energy and Keep Cool This Summer</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Raise your thermostat to 78º.</strong> This is the number one way to conserve energy.</li>
<li><strong>When you are away from home for more than eight hours, raise  the thermostat setting and you can expect to see a 1% savings for each  degree of setback.</strong> This will reduce the amount of energy used  to cool your home while you&#8217;re away. You can learn more about your  thermostat online by visiting the <a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/space_heating_cooling/index.cfm/mytopic=12720" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Department of Energy website</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Keep shades closed when the air conditioner is on.</strong> Sunny windows account for 40 percent of unwanted heat and can make your air conditioner work two to three times harder.</li>
<li><strong>Check and clean filters.</strong> Cleaning and replacing air conditioning filters monthly allows the system to run more efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Install ceiling fans.</strong> Don&#8217;t underestimate the  importance of ceiling fans. Moving air over the body provides a cooling  effect. The use of ceiling fans can mean savings of around 25% on  cooling costs and can make the temperature seem 10 degrees cooler.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Forget the skyscrapers, and forget the suburbs, when you tear down buildings and then replace them you waste tons of energy. Not to mention the crap that they put in landfills. This is especially true when you produce negligible results. If you address the economic issues instead of the housing issues, you solve the problem. Case in point.</p>
<p><a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/chicago-public-housing-0303.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/chicago-public-housing-0303.html</a></p>
<h1>Chicago hope</h1>
<div>Ambitious attempt to help the city’s poor by moving  them out of troubled housing projects is having mixed results, MIT study  finds.</div>
<p>Peter Dizikes, MIT News Office</p>
<p>In December 2010, the last remaining resident was removed from the last  high-rise building standing in Chicago’s notorious Cabrini-Green housing  projects, long a national symbol of urban blight. The relocation was  part of Chicago’s ambitious Plan for Transformation, a 15-year  enterprise aimed at breaking the poverty cycle in which tens of  thousands of the city’s poor have lived, by moving them out of the  projects and into better, safer living environments.</p>
<p>So far,  according to a study by MIT researchers, the Plan for Transformation is  faring only moderately well. Leaving the projects has produced positive  psychological effects for some of Chicago’s poor, but has not  appreciably improved their economic prospects, while relatively few  participants in the program are living in drastically different types of  housing.</p>
<p>“The results are mixed and nuanced,” says Lawrence  Vale, Ford Professor of Urban Design and Planning at MIT, who produced  the report along with Erin Graves, a former postdoctoral research  associate in MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning. The report,  “The Chicago Housing Authority’s Plan for Transformation: What Does the  Research Show So Far?” released in October by the MacArthur Foundation,  surveys 83 previous studies of the Chicago plan conducted by social  scientists.</p>
<p>On the positive side, the report notes that people  leaving Chicago public-housing projects display better mental health;  one study showed that the percentage of residents suffering anxiety  problems in a given year dropped from 30 percent to 21 percent.  Relocated residents also said they felt safer.</p>
<p>However, it is not  clear that relocation helps residents increase their employment  prospects and incomes. One study shows that among working-age  public-housing residents, the proportion employed between 1999, when the  plan was founded, and 2010, remained between 50 percent and 55 percent,  including part-time workers. “The question of whether they’ve made  significant economic gains is unresolved,” notes Vale.</p>
<p>Moreover,  as Vale and Graves emphasize, only about 2,100 of the 26,000 households  relocated as part of the Plan for Transformation have moved from the  projects into mixed-income housing: the smaller, safer developments,  where middle-income families are mixed in with low-income households.</p>
<p>“The  public perception is that Chicago is replacing all of its infamous  public housing with low-rise mixed-income communities,” says Vale. But  as the report notes, about 9,000 households have moved to senior-only  public housing, and 6,000 households have stayed in renovated public  buildings that house only low-income residents. Similarly, Vale says,  “The academic literature has focused on the least common experience, not  on what the city has done with the majority of the housing.”</p>

<h1>Top 10 Tips for Renters!</h1>
</div>
<div id="mid_col">
<p>Even if you rent an apartment, townhouse, or a home, you can make a  big difference, too!  These tips will show you how to be more energy  efficient and save energy, money, and reduce the risks of global  warming.  If there are things you can&#8217;t change on your own, share these  tips and encourage your landlord to help you make a change for the  better.</p>
<ol>
<li>Lighting is one of the easiest places to start saving energy.  Replacing your five most frequently used light fixtures or the bulbs in  them with ENERGY STAR qualified lights can save more than $65 a year in  energy costs. ENERGY STAR qualified compact fluorescent light bulbs  (CFLs) provide high-quality light output, use 75% less energy, and last  6–10 times longer than standard incandescent light bulbs, saving money  on energy bills and replacement costs.
<ul>
<li>Remember to always turn off your lights when leaving a room.  Turning off just one 60-watt incandescent bulb that would otherwise burn  eight hours a day can save about $15 per year!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Considering purchasing a room air conditioner? Consider an ENERGY  STAR qualified model. They use at least 10 percent less energy than  standard models.
<ul>
<li>In the winter, be sure to insulate room air conditioners from  the outside with a tight-fitting a/c unit cover, available at your local  home improvement center or hardware store. This keeps heated air from  escaping outside. Alternately, you can remove the window unit in the  winter months to prevent energy losses.</li>
<li>Be sure the window unit fits tightly in the window so outdoor air is not getting in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If possible, install a programmable thermostat to automatically  adjust your home&#8217;s temperature settings when you&#8217;re away or sleeping.
<ul>
<li>When used properly, a programmable thermostat with its four  temperature settings can save up to $150 a year in energy costs. Proper  use means setting the thermostat at energy-saving temperatures without  overriding that setting. You should also set the &#8220;hold&#8221; button at a  constant energy-saving temperature when you&#8217;re away or on vacation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consumer electronics play an increasingly larger role in your  home&#8217;s energy consumption, accounting for 15 percent of household  electricity use. Many consumer electronics products use energy even when  switched off. Electronics equipment that has earned the ENERGY STAR  helps save energy when off, while maintaining features like clock  displays, channel settings, and remote-control functions.
<ul>
<li>Unplug any battery chargers or power adapters when not in use (like your cell phone charger!).</li>
<li>Use a power strip as a central “turn off” point when you are done using equipment.
<ul>
<li>Even when turned off, electronic and IT equipment often use a  small amount of electricity. For home office equipment, this stand-by or  “phantom” power load can range from a few watts to as much as 20 or  even 40 watts for each piece of equipment. Using a power strip for your  computer and all peripheral equipment allows you to completely  disconnect the power supply from the power source, eliminating standby  power consumption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A ten minute shower can use less water than a full bath.
<ul>
<li>With a new 2.5 gallon-per-minute (low-flow) shower head, a  10-minute shower will use about 25 gallons of water, saving you five  gallons of water over a typical bath. A new showerhead also will save  energy — up to $145 each year on electricity — beating out both the bath  and an old-fashioned showerhead.</li>
<li>To avoid moisture problems, control humidity in your bathroom by  running your ventilating fan during and 15 minutes after showers and  baths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure all air registers are clear of furniture so that air can  circulate freely. If your home has radiators, place heat-resistant  reflectors between radiators and walls. In the winter, this will help  heat the room instead of the wall.</li>
<li>During cold weather, take advantage of the sun&#8217;s warmth by keeping  drapes open during daylight hours. To keep out the heat of the summer  sun, close window shades and drapes in warm weather.</li>
<li>Save water by scraping dishes instead of rinsing them before  loading in the dishwasher. Run your dishwasher with a full load and use  the air-dry option if available.
<ul>
<li>Rinsing dirty dishes before loading your dishwasher uses a lot  of water and energy. Most dishwashers today can thoroughly clean dishes  that have had food scraped, rather than rinsed, off — the wash cycle and  detergent take care of the rest. To make the most efficient use of your  dishwasher&#8217;s energy and water consumption, run the dishwasher only when  enough dirty dishes have accumulated for a full load.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wash your laundry with cold water whenever possible. To save  water, try to wash full loads or, if you must wash a partial load,  reduce the level of water appropriately.
<ul>
<li>Hot water heating accounts for about 90 percent of the energy  your machine uses to wash clothes — only 10 percent goes to electricity  used by the washer motor. Depending on the clothes and local water  quality (hardness), many homeowners can effectively do laundry  exclusively with cold water, using cold water laundry detergents.  Switching to cold water can save the average household more than $40  annually (with an electric water heater) and more than $30 annually  (with a gas water heater).</li>
<li>Washing full loads can save you more than 3,400 gallons of water each year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t over dry your clothes. If your dryer has a moisture sensor  that will automatically turn the machine off when clothes are done, use  it to avoid over drying. Remember to clean the lint trap before every  load. Dry full loads, or reduce drying time for partial loads. Learn  more.
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s easy to over dry your clothes, if one setting is used for  various fabric types. Try to dry loads made up of similar fabrics, so  the entire load dries just as the cycle ends. Many dryers come with  energy-saving moisture or humidity sensors that shut off the heat when  the clothes are dry. If you don&#8217;t have this feature, try to match the  cycle length to the size and weight of the load. A dryer operating an  extra 15 minutes per load can cost you up to $34, every year.</li>
<li>The lint trap is an important energy saver. Dryers work by  moving heated air through wet clothes, evaporating and then venting  water vapor outside. If the dryer cannot provide enough heat, or move  air sufficiently through the clothes, they will take longer to dry, and  may not dry at all. One of the easiest things you can do to increase  drying efficiency is to clean the lint trap before each and every load.  This step also can save you up to $34 each year.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Apartments</h1>
<p>Simple energy conservation measures can lower your utility bills  while increasing the comfort of your apartment. Although your landlord  or management company is ultimately responsible for your building&#8217;s  energy efficiency, you make dozens of energy decisions every day.</p>
<h2>Electricity</h2>
<p>Many ways for cutting electricity costs in houses also apply to apartments. See our section on <a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/electricity/index.cfm/mytopic=11140">reducing electricity use</a> for ways to lower these costs.</p>
<h2>Heating and Cooling</h2>
<p>Here  are some ways to reduce your heating and cooling costs. They can also  make your apartment more comfortable. You might need your landlord&#8217;s or  management company&#8217;s permission for some of the suggestions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/insulation_airsealing/index.cfm/mytopic=11270">Caulk</a> and <a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/insulation_airsealing/index.cfm/mytopic=11280">weatherstrip</a> windows and exterior doors.</li>
<li>Carefully select, install, and use <a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/windows_doors_skylights/index.cfm/mytopic=13500">window treatments or coverings</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Water Heating</h2>
<p>If you have your own water heater in your apartment, see our section on <a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=13030">energy-efficient water heating</a>. If you don&#8217;t have your own water heater, you can still save energy by <a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=13050">reducing your hot water use</a>. You may need your landlord&#8217;s or management company&#8217;s permission for some of these energy conservation measures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know it sounds sorta dumb but if you talk to the landlord about your interest in saving energy&#8230;you may find out that he shares your beliefs or is at least neutral about it. If on the other hand he makes rude comments or says something like, &#8220;I ain no treehugger&#8221;, then you need to drop it. If he seems neutral or somewhat interested. DO NOT ask him to DO anything right away. Follow the tips I have posted here and that are widely available on the web. Then you should causally mentions some of the things that you have done. Look for things that might interest him. Just as an example if you have access to the water heater and he pays the bills&#8230;tell him you turned it down and ask if he notice any savings&#8230;.</p>

<p>As your publicly owned utility, it is our  hope that we can help you become a resourceful and efficient customer.  By choosing energy efficient housing and by following energy saving  habits you will keep your costs at a minimum. Rental property owners are  finding that energy efficient units are easier to rent and require less  <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://www.gocolumbiamo.com/WaterandLight/Images/rentersgd.gif" alt="Renters' Guide" hspace="5" width="144" height="138" align="right" />maintenance than inefficient dwellings.</p>
<p>If you are a renter, the following information can help  you incorporate energy efficiency into your decisions before you rent  and lifestyle choices after you rent, resulting in lower energy costs in  your monthly budget. The information is divided into two parts:</p>
