										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The more things change the more they stay the same. This Blog for instance will change at the beginning of the year. I am going to seek full time employment after working on Community Energy Systems for 6 years. I do not really know what that means. It could mean as little as 1 post a week. In an emergency like Katrina or the Gulf Oil Spew it could mean daily for awhile. Today I leave you with something I have seen up close and personal, the ancient Bristle Cone Pine tree.</p>

<p>By Hunter Oatman-Stanford</p>
<p>n 1964, a geologist in the Nevada wilderness discovered the oldest living thing on earth, after he killed it. The young man was Donald Rusk Currey, a graduate student studying ice-age glaciology in Eastern Nevada; the tree he cut down was of the<em> Pinus longaeva</em>species, also known as the Great Basin bristlecone pine. Working on a grant from the National Science Foundation, Currey was compiling the ages of ancient bristlecone trees to develop a glacial timeline for the region.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Bristlecones are slow-growing and conservative, not the grow-fast, die-young types.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Currey’s ring count for this particular tree reached backward from the present, past the founding of the United States, the Great Crusades, and even the Greek and Roman Empires, to the time of the ancient Egyptians. Sheltered in an unremarkable grove near Wheeler Peak, the bristlecone he cut down was found to be nearly 5,000 years old, taking root only a few hundred years after human history was first recorded. How could a half-dead pine barely 20 feet tall outdo the skyscraper-height sequoias, commonly thought to be the oldest trees alive?</p>
<p>The longevity of Great Basin bristlecones was first recognized in the 1950s by Dr. Edward Schulman, who shocked a scientific community that believed in a correlation between long lifespan and great size. Schulman systematically sampled Great Basin bristlecones in California and Nevada, and published his findings in a 1958 <em>National Geographic </em>article, which revealed several of the trees to be more than 4,000 years old. Schulman’s analysis supported the idea that “adversity begets longevity,” or that the severe conditions in which the bristlecone pine evolved actually helped extend its lifespan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When are the poor countries of the world going to catch a break. First they are conquered by the countries of Europe. Then they are handed over to corrupt and inept &#8220;local&#8221; leadership. Finally they are bought and paid for by the new corporate elites. This is just to0 nasty for words. But this is humans finest hour.</p>
<h1><a href="http://allafrica.com/africa/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Africa</span>:</a> The New Land Grab in Africa &#8211; An Alarming Scramble for the Continent Is On</h1>
<p>Agazit Abate</p>
<p>3 November 2011</p>
<p><em>Multinational corporations are buying enormous tracts of land in Africa to the detriment of local communities. <strong>Agazit Abate</strong> warns that the land grab puts countries on the path to increased food  insecurity, environmental degradation, increased reliance on aid and  marginalisation of farming and pastoralist communities.</em></p>
<div id="google_inset_a">
<div id="google_ads_div_AllAfrica_Story_InsetA_ad_container"><ins><ins></ins></ins></div>
</div>
<p>The recent phenomenon of land grab, as outlined in the extensive  research of the Oakland Institute, has resulted in the sale of enormous  portions of land throughout Africa. In 2009 alone, nearly 60 million  hectares of land were purchased or leased throughout the continent for  the production and export of food, cut flowers and agrofuel crops.</p>
<p>Land grab was in part spurred by the food and financial crisis of  2008 when international bodies, corporations, investment funds, wealthy  individuals, and governments began to re-focus their attention on  agriculture and food as a profitable commodity. As outlined in the  reports, the consequences of land grab include increased food  insecurity, environmental degradation, community repression and  displacement, and increased reliance on aid.</p>
<p><strong>MEET THE INVESTORS</strong></p>
<p>While media coverage has focused on the role of countries like India  and China in land deals, the Oakland Institute&#8217;s investigation reveals  the role of Western firms, wealthy US and European individuals, and  investment funds with ties to major banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP  Morgan. Investors include alternative investment firms like the  London-based Emergent that works to attract speculators, and various  universities like Harvard, Spelman and Vanderbilt.</p>
<p>Several Texas-based interests are associated with a major 600,000  hectares South Sudan deal which involves Kinyeti Development LLC, an  Austin, Texas-based &#8216;global business development partnership and holding  company&#8217; managed by Howard Eugene Douglas, a former United States  Ambassador at Large and Coordinator for Refugee Affairs. A key player in  the largest land deal in Tanzania is Iowa agribusiness entrepreneur and  Republican Party stalwart, Bruce Rastetter.</p>
<p>US companies are often below the radar, using subsidiaries registered  in other countries, like Petrotech-ffn Agro Mali which is a subsidiary  of Petrotech-ffn USA. Many European countries are also involved, often  with support provided by their governments and embassies in African  countries. For instance, Swedish and German firms have interests in the  production of biofuels in Tanzanian. Addax Bioenergy from Switzerland  and Quifel International Holdings (QIH) from Portugal are major  investors in Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone Agriculture (SLA) is actually a  subsidiary of the UK based Crad-1 (CAPARO Renewable Agriculture  Developments Ltd.), associated with the Tony Blair African Governance  Initiative.</p>

<p>I just wanted to post the villains. For the rest of the analysis, go there and read that. More tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post was really difficult for me. Riding animals has been a human practice for thousands of years and still is in use in many parts of the world. From dog sleds in the north to camels in the south and horses all inbetween many hundreds of animals have been used to haul humans and freight. In some places humans even haul people in what Americans usually refer to as rickshaws. I contemplated making this a multiple post but the biggest question for me is how this move back to animals as a major form of transportation would restructure our world. How would we feed them all? How quickly would it happen? How many people would have to give way for all of the offset food? Anyway there are so many ways I could have diced this pie that a simple post will have to do. Please try not to think about how much manure this would generate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some animals are used due to sheer physical strength in tasks such as ploughing or logging. Such animals are grouped as a <strong>draught</strong> or <strong>draft animal</strong>. Others may be used as <a title="Pack animal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pack_animal">pack animals</a>, for <a title="Animal-powered transport" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal-powered_transport">animal-powered transport</a>, the movement of people and goods.

<ul>
<li><a title="Oxen" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxen">Oxen</a> are slow but strong, and have been used in a yoke since ancient times:  the earliest surviving vehicle, Puabi&#8217;s Sumerian sledge, was ox-drawn;  an acre was originally defined as the area a span of oxen could plow in a  day. The <a title="Domestic buffalo" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_buffalo">Water buffalo</a> and <a title="Carabao" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carabao">Carabao</a>, domesticated water buffalo, pull wagons and ploughs in <a title="Southeast Asia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia">Southeast Asia</a> and the <a title="Philippines" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines">Philippines</a>.</li>
<li><a title="Draught horse" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draught_horse">Draught or Draft horses</a> are commonly used in harness for heavy work. Several breeds of  medium-weight horses are used to pull lighter wheeled carts, carriages  and buggies when a certain amount of speed or style is desirable.</li>
<li><a title="Mule" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule">Mules</a> are considered to be very tough and strong, with harness capacity dependent on the type of horse <a title="Mare" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare">mare</a> used to produce the mule <a title="Foal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foal">foal</a>. Because they are a <a title="Hybrid (biology)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_%28biology%29">hybrid</a> animal and usually are infertile, separate breeding programs must also be maintained.</li>
<li><a title="Pony" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pony">Ponies</a> and <a title="Donkey" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey">donkeys</a> are often used to pull carts and small wagons, historically, ponies were commonly used in <a title="Mining" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining">mining</a> to pull ore carts.</li>
<li><a title="Dog" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog">Dogs</a> are used for pulling light carts or, particularly, sleds. (e.g. <a title="Sled dog" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sled_dog">sled dogs</a> such as Huskies) for both recreation and working purposes.</li>
<li><a title="Goat" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat">Goats</a> also can perform light harness work in front of carts</li>
<li><a title="Reindeer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reindeer">Reindeer</a> are used in the <a title="Arctic" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic">Arctic</a> and sub-Arctic Nordic countries and Siberia.</li>

<p><strong>The Central     Disposal Facility (CDF)</strong> is located   on Adamson Road in Cocoa. The property was first used for solid waste disposal   in the 1960&#8217;s. Since then the County has continued to make improvements operationally   and environmentally. For example, the 192-acre permitted landfill area is lined   by a clay slurry wall, groundwater monitoring wells have been installed, and   a methane gas collection and flare system is in place.</p>
<p>The site originally consisted of 285 acres. CDF now totals 957 acres. Portions     of the landfill have been closed by capping it with a liner, two feet of       cover dirt, and sod. It is estimated Brevard County will have enough landfill       capacity     to handle the disposal needs for the county until 2014.</p>
<p>In addition to the landfill area itself, there are many other areas within   the landfill which emphasize waste reduction and environmental protection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What a difference the evaporation of 5 $$$ gasoline and 2 years makes. Obama is President and one of the greenest Presidents we have ever had. McCain is not. Gasoline, though rising, is at 3.25 $$$ a gallon. Electric cars have just rolled out of two car companies, one of which Obama saved through a bailout. The electrics are popular and have waiting lists. The new normal for cars is 40 miles to the gallon. Of course I have the advantage of hindsight but I was pointing out that Obama had the superior energy policy back then so I can crow alittle.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/06/mccain_scores_with_offshore_dr.html" target="_self" rel="noopener">http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/06/mccain_scores_with_offshore_dr.html</a></p>
<p>June 19, 2008</p>
<h2>McCain Scores With Offshore Drilling Proposal</h2>
<p><strong>By</strong> <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/author/dick_morris_and_eileen_mcgann/"><strong>Dick Morris and Eileen McGann</strong></a></p>
<p>John McCain has drawn first blood in the political debate following  Barack Obama&#8217;s victory in the primaries. His call yesterday for offshore  oil drilling &#8212; and Bush&#8217;s decision to press the issue in Congress &#8211;  puts the Democrats in the position of advocating the wear-your-sweater  policies that made Jimmy Carter unpopular.</p>
<p>With gas prices nearing $5, all of the previous shibboleths need to  be discarded. Where once voters in swing states like Florida opposed  offshore drilling, the high gas prices are prompting them to reconsider.  McCain&#8217;s argument that even hurricane Katrina did not cause any oil  spills from the offshore rigs in the Gulf of Mexico certainly will go  far to allay the fears of the average voter.</p>
<p>For decades, Americans have dragged their feet when it comes to  switching their cars, leaving their SUVs at home, and backing  alternative energy development and new oil drilling. But the recent  shock of a massive surge in oil and gasoline prices has awakened the  nation from its complaisance. The soaring prices are the equivalent of  Pearl Harbor in jolting us out of our trance when it comes to energy.</p>
<div id="article-box-ad"><a href="http://ads.forbes.com/RealMedia/ads/click_lx.ads/realclearpolitics.com/story/1096689056/Block/OasDefault_v5/default/empty.gif/47505654506b306b6c37734142706738" target="_top" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://ads.forbes.com/RealMedia/ads/adstream_lx.ads/realclearpolitics.com/story/1096689056/Block/OasDefault_v5/default/empty.gif/47505654506b306b6c37734142706738?" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /></a></div>
<p>Suddenly, everything is on the table. Offshore drilling, Alaska  drilling, nuclear power, wind, solar, flex-fuel cars, plug-in cars are  all increasingly attractive options and John McCain seems alive to the  need to go there while Obama is strangely passive. During the Democratic  primary, he opposed a gas tax holiday and continues to be against  offshore and Alaska drilling and squishy on nuclear power. That leaves  turning down your thermostat and walking to work as the Democratic  policies.</p>
<p>McCain has also been ratcheting up his attacks on oil speculators.  With the total value of trades in oil futures soaring from $13 billion  in 2003 to $260 billion today, it is increasingly clear that it is not  the supply and demand for oil which is, alone, driving up the price, but  it is the supply and demand for oil futures which is stoking the upward  movement.</p>
<p>The Saudis have made a fatal mistake in not forcing down the price of  oil. We could have gone for decades as their hostage, letting their  control over our oil supplies choke us while enriching them. But they  got greedy and let the price skyrocket.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Just so we are clear here, the Greedy Saudi&#8217;s had nothing to do with the gasoline prices, speculators and greedy refinery owners did. But then they are these guys friends so they couldn&#8217;t possibly see that. More tomorrow.</p>

But what the &#8220;near miss hurricane&#8221; showed is that they and their sand barriers are full of crap. Even worse, by insisting that BP hire local unemployed workers as clean up people, the tox results from previous oil spills show that they are also going to lead to people&#8217;s deaths. Way to go you two.</p>

<p>The  shut down on June 23 of part of the state&#8217;s dredging operations for  construction of offshore sand berms was treated by Governor Jindal as a  sudden and arbitrary action by federal agencies. (1) But the reality is  somewhat different.</p>
<p>While some media stories conveyed the  impression that the state&#8217;s entire sand berm plan was approved by the  Corps of Engineers in late May, only six sections of the original  proposal were given a permit. Two sections to the east of the river, on  the upper end of the Chandeleur  Island chain, and four sections west of the river were  authorized by the Corps, which described them as &#8220;critical locations  where greater immediate benefit is likely to be achieved with minimal  adverse disruption of coastal circulation patterns.&#8221; (2)</p>
<p>The  Corps Permit specified the source areas for sand/sediment: Ship Shoal,  South Pelto, the Mississippi  River Offshore Disposal Site, and Pass a Loutre for the western  sites, and St. Bernard shoal and Hewes Point for the sites to the east.  The location of borrow and dredge sites at the northern end of the  Chandeleur Islands has been one of the areas of greatest concern. NOAA and other agencies  had pointed out that creating borrow pits or dredging in close proximity  to the islands could cause accelerated erosion and even compromise  their stability, so using a source site a couple of miles away was a  condition of the permit.</p>
<p>Soon after receiving its permit,  however, the state began to voice its intention to source near to the  islands after all, due to a lack of pipe for pumping sand and mud from a  distance. The state said it would replace sand from the dredged site  within a few weeks, but federal agencies agreed to this change with a  much shorter time limit because of the possible effects on the island.</p>
<p>Despite  the Governor&#8217;s repeated claims that &#8220;we don&#8217;t have a day to wait,&#8221; the  state was not ready for the approved level of dredging even after it was  approved. Federal officials said that &#8220;the state has been unprepared  since the beginning, has caused further delay because it did not have  the proper pipe available and has continued to asked for time to shift  to the offshore site. According to the Interior Department, it gave the  state permission for more than a week to use the closer source of sand  while locating the pipe, but that allowing the state to continue  dredging could have negative effects on existing barrier islands.&#8221; (3)</p>
<p>An  official with the Department of Interior noted that if the department  had allowed the state to continue digging where it was digging, they  feared approaching a &#8220;tipping point&#8221; with an &#8220;impact on that island  chain that may never be restored.&#8221;(4) The Governor&#8217;s reaction was to  completely ignore these considerations and instead attack the federal  agencies: &#8220;We haven&#8217;t heard from them before today about any concern  about these islands or this area. All of a sudden now that we&#8217;re  building new land to protect our coast, they&#8217;re worried about a  hypothetical consequence?&#8221; (5)</p>
<p>The Governor may not have heard or  read the federal agencies concerns in their response to the state&#8217;s  permit application, or have seen the U.S. Geological Survey report last year  about the status of the Chandeleur Islands and how they could be  actually restored in ways that minimize adverse impacts (<a rel="nofollow noopener" href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?et=1103531264084&amp;s=1879&amp;e=001UAJr95lHaOQESm-X8_u_lnmuKO0VSi_te6kBnQmctG3gK3qkR74TfvXeYBQJm-A-0HKaT4hiSGAZC0oD6r-_fA63GB6Ckb-q0aLX7Mls0fRO0ak1s96m_ZYyS0d4zT61qZ0U4YhHwzE=" target="_blank">http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2009/5252</a>).  He could have read the comments of his own Department of Wildlife and  Fisheries, which pointed out in its letter to the Corps the need  to &#8220;determine whether or not borrow area excavation will increase wave  energy and subsequent shoreline erosion, alter littoral currents, or  otherwise impact depositional processes, in a way that undermines the  sustainability of inland islands, marsh, and shorelines, most  importantly the Chandeleur Islands.&#8221; (6)</p>

<p>Breaking news: You need not worry about the safety  of offshore oil drilling. How do I know this? Well, let&#8217;s just say a hat  tip is in order for Exxon&#8217;s new blog, <a href="http://www.exxonmobilperspectives.com/2010/06/14/addressing-gom-spill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perspectives</a>,  which launched today with a post about the Deepwater Horizon disaster.  &#8220;This devastating chain of events is far from the industry norm,&#8221;  proclaims Exxon blogger Ken Cohen, who&#8217;s also the oil giant&#8217;s vice  president of public and government affairs. &#8220;We all need to understand  what occurred on this occasion that did not occur on the 14,000 other  deepwater wells that have been successfully drilled around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translated into the kind of language that actual bloggers use,  Cohen&#8217;s missive appears to be saying that Exxon and the world&#8217;s other  upstanding oil outfits shouldn&#8217;t be punished for BP&#8217;s bad behavior.  &#8220;Energy consumers around the world need the energy and natural gas  resources found in offshore and deepwater regions,&#8221; he concludes, &#8220;but  they expect it to be done safely and in an environmentally sensitive  way.</p>

<p>What happened at the <a title="Deepwater Horizon Link" href="http://www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com/go/site/2931/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deepwater Horizon</a> rig  is a tragedy on many levels – from the terrible loss of life involved,  to the ongoing impact of the spill on the environment, communities and  businesses of the Gulf Coast.  Everyone at ExxonMobil  shares in the concern over the accident and spill, and we have  contributed personnel and equipment to help with the response.</p>
<p>The Presidential Commission’s investigation and others underway  will help us determine what happened and what needs to be done going  forward.  This devastating chain of events is far from the industry  norm.  We all need to understand what occurred on this occasion that did  not occur at the 14,000 other deepwater wells that have  been successfully drilled around the world.</p>

<h2>Latest news:</h2>
<p><strong>Subsea operational update &#8211; 14 June. </strong>Preparations  for   additional planned enhancements to the LMRP cap containment  system continue to   progress. The first planned addition, to operate in  addition to the LMRP cap   system, will take oil and gas from the choke  line of the failed Deepwater   Horizon blow-out preventer (BOP) through  a separate riser to the Q4000 vessel on   the surface. Both the oil and  gas captured by this additional system are   expected to be flared  through a specialised clean-burning system. This system is   intended to  increase the amount of oil and gas that can be captured from the   well  and is currently anticipated to begin operations in the next few days.</p>

<p>Energy prices have become a profoundly important issue to  consumers, governments and the oil and gas industry today.</p>
<p>The problem is formidable: under pressure from worldwide  demand growth and reduced spare supply, how does the industry continue  to meet the needs of consumers in an affordable and environmentally  responsible way?</p>
<p>As thousands of delegates from 61 member countries gather in  Madrid from June 29 through July 3 for the World Petroleum Congress,  this event blog will report on ways technology and new ideas are  addressing these challenges and shaping the oil and gas industry.</p>
<p>Chevron participants to the Congress, which is held every  three years, will share how they see the industry responding to this  dynamic marketplace. The era of easy access to cheap oil is clearly  over. The industry has already begun developing new technologies to  deliver the energy that current and future generations will need to  support their economies and prosper. The Congress will highlight some of  this activity.</p>

<div>
<div>We would  like to share with you a reflection on the personal impacts of the BP  Deepwater Horizon Disaster written by our colleague and friend Mike  Roberts of Louisiana Bayoukeeper. Mike has made a life for himself and  his family fishing the waters of the Louisiana coast. Now BP&#8217;s disaster  is threatening an entire way of life.</p>

<div><span>Summer Of  Tears</span><br />
by Mike Roberts</div>
<p>The boat ride, out,  from Lafitte, Louisiana, Sunday, May 23, 2010, to our fishing grounds was not unlike any other I have taken in my life, as a commercial fisherman from this area.  I have made the trip thousands of times in my 35 plus years shrimping and crabbing.  A warm breeze in my face, it is a typical Louisiana summer day.  3 people were with me, my wife Tracy, Ian Wren, and our grandson, Scottie.  I was soon to find out, how untypical this day would become for me, not unlike a death in the family.  This was going to be a very bad day for me.</p>
<p>As we neared Barataria Bay, the smell of crude oil in the air was getting thicker and thicker.  An event that always brought joy to me all of my life, the approach of the fishing grounds, was slowly turning into a nightmare.  As we entered Grand Lake, the name we fishermen call Barataria Bay, I started to see a weird, glassy look to the water and soon it became evident to me, there was oil sheen as far as I could see.  Soon, we were running past patches of red oil floating on top of the water.  As we headed farther south, we saw at least a dozen boats, in the distance, which appeared to be shrimping.  We soon realized that shrimping was not what they were doing at all, but instead they were towing oil booms in a desperate attempt to corral oil that was pouring into our fishing grounds.  We stopped to talk to one of the fishermen, towing a boom, a young fisherman from Lafitte.  What he told me floored me.  He said, &#8220;What we are seeing in the lake, the oil, was but a drop in the bucket of what was to come.&#8221;  He had just come out of the Gulf of Mexico and he said, &#8220;It was unbelievable, the oil runs for miles and miles and was headed for shore and into our fishing grounds&#8221;.  I thought, what I had already seen in the lake was enough for a lifetime.  We talked a little while longer, gave the fisherman some protective respirators and were soon on our way.  As we left the small fleet of boats, working feverishly, trying to corral the oil, I became overwhelmed with what I just saw.</p>
<p>I am not real emotional and consider myself a pretty tough guy.You have to be to survive as a fisherman. As I left that scene, tears flowed down my face and I cried.  Something I have not done in a long time, but would do several more times that day.  I tried not to let my grandson, Scottie, see me crying.  I didn&#8217;t think he would understand, I was crying for his stolen future.  None of this will be the same, for decades to come.  The damage is going to be immense and I do not think our lives here in South Louisiana will ever be the same.  He is too young to understand.  He has an intense love for our way of life here.  He wants to be a fisherman and a fishing guide when he gets older.  It is what he is, it is in his soul, and it is his culture.  How can I tell him that this may never come to pass now, now that everything he loves in the outdoors may soon be destroyed by this massive oil spill?  How do we tell this to a generation of young people, in south Louisiana who live and breathe this bayou life that they love so much, could soon be gone?  How do we tell them?  All this raced through my mind and I wept.</p>
<p>We continued farther south towards Grand Terre Island.  We approached Bird Island.  The real name is Queen Bess Island, but we call it Bird Island, because it is always full of birds.  It is a rookery, a nesting island for thousands of birds, pelicans, terns, gulls etc.  As we got closer, we saw that protective boom had been placed around about two thirds of the island.  It was obvious to me, that oil had gone under the boom and was fouling the shore and had undoubtedly oil some birds.  My God.  We would see this scene again at Cat Island and other unnamed islands that day.  We continued on to the east past Coup Abel Pass and more shrimp boats trying to contain some of the oil on the surface.  We arrived at 4 Bayou Pass to see more boats working on the same thing.  We beached the boat and decided to look at the beach between the passes.</p>
<p>The scene was one of horror to me.  There was thick red oil on the entire stretch of beach, with oil continuing to wash ashore.  The water looked to be infused with red oil, with billions of, what appeared to be, red pebbles of oil washing up on the beach with every wave.  The red oil pebbles, at the high tide mark on the beach were melting into pools of red goo in the hot Louisiana sun.  The damage was overwhelming.  There was nobody there to clean it up.  It would take an army to do it.  Like so much of coastal Louisiana, it was accessible only by boat.  Will it ever be cleaned up?  I don&#8217;t know.  Tears again.  We soon left that beach and started to head home.</p>
<p>We took a little different route home, staying a little farther to the east side of Barataria Bay.  As we approached the northern end of the bay, we ran into another raft of oil that appeared to be covering many square miles.  It was only a mile from the interior bayous on the north side of Barataria Bay.  My God.  No boats were towing boom in this area.  I do not think anyone even knew it was there.  A little bet farther north, we saw some shrimp boats with boom, on anchor, waiting to try and protect Bayou St. Dennis from the oil.  I alerted them of the approaching oil.  I hope they were able to control it before it reached the bayou.  We left them and started to head in.</p>
<p>My heart never felt so heavy, as on that ride in.  I thought to myself, this is the most I&#8217;ve cried since I was a baby.  In fact I am sure it was.  This will be a summer of tears for a lot of us in south Louisiana.</p>
