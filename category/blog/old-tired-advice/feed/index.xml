										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just like CANCER. That was the first thought I had when I read this article. Evidence was gathered 60 years ago. People spoke up, and the oil and gas industry killed any discussion. Now we are stuck with more powerful Hurricanes. We are stuck with the American west being consumed by droughts and fire. The Arctic is gone and the Antarctic going. The world should confiscate their wealth and apply every dime to remediating the effects. Unfortunately the whole world never does anything. I mean the UN could pass a resolution but Pfffhh.</p>

<p class="dcr-s23rjr"><span class="dcr-114to15"><span class="dcr-1jnp7wy">I</span></span><span class="dcr-s23rjr">n August 1974, the CIA produced a study on “climatological research as it pertains to intelligence problems”. The diagnosis was dramatic. It warned of the emergence of a new era of weird weather, leading to political unrest and mass migration (which, in turn, would cause more unrest). The new era the agency imagined wasn’t necessarily one of hotter temperatures; the CIA had heard from scientists warning of global cooling as well as warming. But the direction in which the thermometer was traveling wasn’t their immediate concern; it was the political impact. They knew that the so-called “<a title="" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/29/little-ice-age" data-link-name="in body link">little ice age</a>”, a series of cold snaps between, roughly, 1350 and 1850, had brought not only drought and famine, but also war – and so could these new climatic changes.</span></p>
<p class="dcr-s23rjr">“The climate change began in 1960,” the report’s first page informs us, “but no one, including the climatologists, recognized it.” Crop failures in the Soviet Union and India in the early 1960s had been attributed to standard unlucky weather. The US shipped grain to India and the Soviets killed off livestock to eat, “and premier Nikita Khrushchev was quietly deposed”.</p>
<p class="dcr-s23rjr">But, the report argued, the world ignored this warning, as the global population continued to grow and states made massive investments in energy, technology and medicine.</p>

<p>MOSCOW (AP) — Belarus&#8217; first nuclear power plant began operating Tuesday, a project that has spooked its neighbor Lithuania, which immediately cut off importing electricity from Belarus at the news.</p>
<p>The Russian-built Astravyets nuclear power plant, 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, has been connected to Belarus&#8217; power grid and has started producing electricity, according to Belarusian electricity operator Belenergo.</p>
<p>Lithuanian authorities long have opposed the plant&#8217;s construction, arguing that the project has been plagued by accidents, stolen materials and the mistreatment of workers. In line with the country&#8217;s law banning electricity imports from Belarus once the plant starts, Lithuania&#8217;s Litgrid power operator cut the inflow of electricity from Belarus upon receiving data that the Astravyets nuclear reactor had started producing energy.</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s state nuclear corporation Rosatom, which built the plant, has rejected the Lithuanian complaints, saying the plant&#8217;s design conforms to the highest international standards as confirmed by the International Atomic Energy Agency, a U.N. watchdog.</p>

<p><strong>What is This Device?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s called ÖkoWatt and its tech was originally created by no other than the legendary Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist, Nikola Tesla.</p>
<p>Initially it was concealed from the general public because it offered average families the opportunity to save on their monthly energy costs. <a href="http://track.roinattrack.com/click?cep=2iSzLCQN0QDlUE_kc09NvGhBKa4V9Ds1f1yyex-Z58wWB_8RM5YwHXsOKH9NWUtbuCUSEMRKHQ_0RlDGcUpFlJzGXzi4Q_p74VT-SWA2Q0i-Amg8DFsYirLyDONBCYYGMTX9V7TsDuuIZkSVuIL76ySCYwsuwsEUjTcMDlbbd79ETiuYdHHt5oGNQdr1l1eN7JPAsD9viwI-kdqmdTQvkbPd9bdjXInYoegmhpYVBIUXGEESFgLUY8_CvXOPm9Clow1QlJnEaHOjY_GdeJgzp5p53t2mhHj-vj1kxXzkn49xdzLAV9y76nAZJmRS3uV_nv_UPspIgPLK2NkkliRU4r8uXeozX-1H8ZniVXk_djgY91el84Pbh34N5ozleyRYFKReOdCJ-RDKkHh0ExgHan4LjC9L7uL56NKlOIASPj_sC4R9vbQtBfpCO51NEXXA5XZ8yx2ibfxptiiJ9r4pL9Gas3GK5szYiYN8yVYXopT4LgI9MXdJ2xGppP2wnfHhysBeE3FMbR4NJL1HDz8tfQ&amp;lptoken=154f8257813173a793f7&amp;adversion_id=4238759&amp;ad_id=369037&amp;budget_id=206702&amp;adcampaign_id=150894&amp;publication_id=2853&amp;headline_id=1322572&amp;content_id=279679&amp;previewimage_id=333544&amp;device=desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ÖkoWatt is a small, compact, affordable, and easy-to-use plug-in unit</strong></a><strong> </strong>that stops unnecessary power from entering the electrical cables and overloading the network.</p>
<p>ÖkoWatt is your power company&#8217;s worst nightmare. They have been trying to hide ÖkoWatt from the everyday consumer and have even banned it in retail shops.</p>
<p>Big Energy is threatened by this device and its potential to cut into profits.</p>
<p>However, thanks to the Internet, the secret is out, and everyday people are now reaping the rewards of less power consumption overall, <strong><em>as well as that used by household appliances.</em></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a travesty on so many levels. First at the corporate level, who ran this company into the ground? I mean seriously there are all kind of remedies for years, including burying power lines, and cladding power lines or leasing solar on customers roofs. To not do anything but take profit for thirty years should get someone jail time. Second, what about the employees? The Camp Fire was cause my a Power Pole that was ONE HUNDRED years old. Why did someone not take the damn thing down on their own initiative? Again &#8211; Jail Time. Where were the regulators? That should have made them create a revitalization and safety plans 30 years ago. Again &#8211; Jail Time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past 12 years I have never posted an entire work. That is kind of the point here. To get you to go to other sites and read. Maybe on your own to go to another link to expand your world or you knowledge base. But Greta said it so well and what she said is so important that I am going to put it all up here. I am going to put up a link so NBC gets credit but there isn&#8217;t anything extra there.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/read-greta-thunberg-s-full-speech-united-nations-climate-action-n1057861">https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/read-greta-thunberg-s-full-speech-united-nations-climate-action-n1057861</a></p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">My message is that we&#8217;ll be watching you.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">This is all wrong. I shouldn&#8217;t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet, you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you!</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words and yet I&#8217;m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">For more than 30 years, the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you&#8217;re doing enough when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency, but no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not want to believe that. Because if you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act then you would be evil and that I refuse to believe.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50 percent chance of staying below 1.5 degrees and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">Fifty percent may be acceptable to you, but those numbers do not include tipping points, most feedback loops, additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution or the aspects of equity and climate justice.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">They also rely on my generation sucking hundreds of billions of tons of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">So a 50 percent risk is simply not acceptable to us, we who have to live with the consequences.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">How dare you pretend that this can be solved with just business as usual and some technical solutions? With today&#8217;s emissions levels, that remaining CO2 budget will be entirely gone within less than eight and a half years.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures here today, because these numbers are too uncomfortable and you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">You are failing us, but the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you and if you choose to fail us, I say: We will never forgive you.</p>
<p class="endmarkEnabled">We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up and change is coming, whether you like it or not.</p>
<p class="">Thank you.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Thats all folks. More next week.</p>

<p>Unusually hot and dry conditions in parts of the northern hemisphere have been conducive to fires raging from the Mediterranean to – in particular – the Arctic. Climate change, with rising temperatures and shifts in precipitation patterns, is amplifying the risk of wildfires and prolonging the season.</p>
<p>WMO’s Global Atmosphere Watch Programme has released a <a href="http://https://youtu.be/ZfJsedQlio0">short animation</a> which highlights the risks and explains how advances in satellite technology make it possible to detect and monitor fire dangers. Improving forecasting systems is important for predictions and warnings around fire danger and related air pollution hazards.</p>
<p>In addition to the direct threat from burning, wildfires also release harmful pollutants including particulate matter and toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and non-methane organic compounds into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Particles and gases from burning biomass can be carried over long distances, affecting air quality in regions far away.</p>
<p><strong>Heatwaves fuel fires</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week&#8217;s articles says &#8211; Not Likely. I say the trees are a good start. The point is that some people argue for trees or solar panels in the desert for instance. But the desert is an ecosystem that trees or solar panels would disrupt. Deserts are not &#8220;throw away&#8221; ecosystems. So we can only deploy so much of each. This is why i think geothermal is the ultimate solution.</p>

<p>Last week, a new study in the journal <em><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Science (opens in a new tab)">Science</a></em> highlighted the role forests could play in <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2019/07/04/could-planting-tons-of-trees-solve-climate-change/#.XR9vR9NKjm1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="tackling climate change (opens in a new tab)">tackling climate change</a>. Researchers estimated that by restoring forests to their maximum potential, we could cut down atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) by 25 percent — a move that would take us back to levels not seen in over a century. Though the study brings hope in the fight against climate change, other experts warn the solution is not that simple.</p>
<p>The study, led by scientists at ETH-Zürich, Switzerland, determined the planet has 0.9 billion hectares of land available to hold more trees — an area the size of the continental U.S. Converting those areas into forests would be a game-changer for climate change, the authors suggested.</p>
<p>“[The study] is probably the best assessment we have to date of how much land could support tree cover on our planet,” says Robin Chazdon, a forest ecologist and professor emeritus at the University of Connecticut not involved in the study, But she is quick to point out that restoring forests is not as simple as it sounds.</p>

<p>Go there and think. More next week.</p>

<p>The utility struck a deal with environmental and labor groups in the Upper Midwest that will allow it to reduce its carbon emissions while easing job losses related to coal plant retirements.</p>

<p>Xcel Energy <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xcel-energy-end-coal-upper-154800947.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">plans to close</a> its last two coal-fired power plants in Minnesota by 2030, a decade earlier than scheduled, while keeping its nuclear power plants running through at least 2040 — the latest step in the eight-state utility’s plan to reach <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/xcel-commits-to-100-carbon-free-electricity-by-20501#gs.d6nxos">100 percent carbon-free</a> electricity by 2050.</p>
<p>The proposed early closures are part of its Upper Midwest Energy Plan, which Xcel expects to submit to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission in July. If approved, it will allow Xcel to cut its carbon emissions in the state by 80 percent compared to 2005 levels. That’s a key metric from Xcel’s <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/xcel-commits-to-100-carbon-free-electricity-by-20501#gs.d6nxos">companywide zero-carbon</a> goals announced in December, up from its previous target of 60 percent reduction from 2005 levels by 2030.</p>
<p>Monday’s announcement comes as part of a settlement agreement with environmental and labor groups, meant both to boost clean energy alternatives and help ease the job and economic losses when the Allen S. King coal power plant in Bayport, Minnesota closes by 2028 and the Sherco 3 coal-fired generator in Becker, Minnesota closes by 2030.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Xcel would proceed with plans to buy the Mankato Energy Center natural-gas plant. But its plans to build a new natural-gas power plant, as well as extend the operating license of its Monticello nuclear plant past its 2030 expiration until at least 2040, are being opposed by some environmental groups.</p>

Clean Energy was going to chase coal all across the globe as it fought a rear guard action. Then it would become a novelty &#8211; OH LOOK they still use that stupid stuff. Then people will marvel at all the damage it had done and it would go away.</p>

<p class="speakable-p-1 p-text">The embers of the coal industry have been slowly fading in recent years, despite efforts by the Trump administration to reignite the flames.</p>
<p class="speakable-p-2 p-text">But an announcement this week from a northern Indiana utility — in the heart of a state that ranks in the top 10 for both coal production and consumption — suggests the end may be nearer than some expect.</p>
<p class="p-text">After having already announced plans to <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/environment/2018/09/20/move-over-coal-indiana-utility-switching-solar-and-wind/1369539002/" data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a">speed up the retirement of its coal power plants</a>, the Northern Indiana Public Service Company said this week that it will switch to renewable energy to make its electricity instead.</p>
<p class="p-text">Why? Because it&#8217;s cheaper. A lot cheaper, they said, to the tune of more than $4 billion over a few decades. Still, those long-term savings might come with a short-term price. The utility is asking for a raise in its rates to upgrade infrastructure.</p>

<p>Go there and read. More next week.</p>

<p class="content__segment combx">Duke Energy Corp. expects to spend $500 million over the next 15 years installing more than 300 megawatts worth of storage batteries on its Carolinas grid.</p>
<p class="content__segment combx">Charlotte-based Duke (NYSE: DUK) released the estimate Wednesday morning, days after <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/news/2018/10/09/duke-energy-proposes-solar-plus-storage-project.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposing its first microgrid project </a>— including a two-megawatt solar farm and a four-megawatt storage battery — for residential and business customers. That will serve the remote mountain town of Hot Springs, on the North Carolina-Tennessee border north of Asheville.</p>
<p class="content__segment combx">Duke says it plans to expand the use of batteries beyond storing and dispatching of energy. Its long-range plan includes deploying batteries for other purposes such as system balancing, increasing reliability of “end of the line” power supplies and to defer other traditional grid upgrades.</p>
