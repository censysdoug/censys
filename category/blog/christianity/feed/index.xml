<h1>Coal, nuclear plant operator files for bankruptcy, asks Trump for a bailout</h1>
<h2>FirstEnergy&#8217;s request comes after regulator struck down an industry-wide bailout plan.</h2>

<p>On Saturday, power corporation FirstEnergy placed its coal and nuclear generation units <a href="https://cms.arstechnica.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=226681&amp;action=edit">under chapter 11 bankruptcy</a>. Although coal and nuclear plants across the country have struggled to compete with the low prices of natural gas, FirstEnergy&#8217;s filing is unique because it stands to take on a political dimension. Just two days before FirstEnergy&#8217;s bankruptcy filing, the company petitioned the Department of Energy (DOE) for an emergency bailout, <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/firstenergy-asks-doe-for-emergency-action-to-save-pjm-coal-nuke-plants/520280/">citing concerns about reliability</a>.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p>The petition could reinvigorate a debate started by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/energy-secretary-proposes-rule-to-make-grid-managers-favor-coal-nuclear/">proposed a rule</a> last year to change how coal and nuclear plants are compensated for their power. The rule was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/federal-regulator-denies-rick-perrys-proposal-to-compensate-coal-nuclear/">denied by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> (FERC), which said that there was not enough evidence to justify changing how coal and nuclear are compensated.</p>
<p>FirstEnergy disparaged FERC&#8217;s decision in <a href="https://statepowerproject.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/fes-202c-application.pdf">its Thursday petition</a> (PDF), claiming that &#8220;as a result of FERC’s and the RTO&#8217;s [Regional Transmission Organization&#8217;s] failure to address this crisis, swift and decisive action is needed <em>now</em> to address this imminent loss of nuclear and coal-fired baseload generation and the threat to the electric grid that this loss poses&#8221; (emphasis FirstEnergy&#8217;s).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Unitarian Church in Springfield Il. has invested in itself and its environment. I must add frustration here, as an accumulator type journalist, because I had the article in my hands. It did a great job of describing what they have done. I could not find so I had to use two sources that do it justice, but not as good as the first article. I am sorry.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aluuc.org/togetherweshare/wp-content/uploads/ALUUC-Newsletter-March-2017-web.pdf">http://www.aluuc.org/togetherweshare/wp-content/uploads/ALUUC-Newsletter-March-2017-web.pdf</a></p>
<div class="textLayer">
<div>Page</div>
<div>8</div>
<div>Green Sanctuary News</div>
<div>Notes from the ALUUC Prairie</div>
<div>The Green Sanctuary Committee burned the ALUUC prairie the</div>
<div>first Sunday in February. What a blaze! Flames over 5 feet tall</div>
<div>—</div>
<div>for</div>
<div>maybe 10 minutes. These burns have to be conducted with care using</div>
<div>equipment and training that have been developed over years of experi-</div>
<div>ence with prairie burning.</div>
<div>So why burn? Before Europeans arrived in the U.S., native people</div>
<div>routinely burned the prairies to stimulate growth of new plants for game</div>
<div>and to make hunting easier. Lightning also set prairies ablaze. Over thou-</div>
<div>sands of years, prairie plants adapted to these fires</div>
<div>—</div>
<div>sending roots deep</div>
<div>into the earth to protect against both drought and fires. Fires can kill less</div>
<div>adapted plants such as cool season grasses and some shrubby plants that</div>
<div>can take over the prairie. So we burn for the same reason</div>
<div>—</div>
<div>to rid the area of last year’s growth, stimu-</div>
<div>late new growth and rid the prairie of undesirable plants such as cool season grasses.</div>
<div>A common concern is that burning releases carbon</div>
<div>into the air adding to global warming. True, burning</div>
<div>does release carbon into the air</div>
<div>—</div>
<div>but this carbon is</div>
<div>“new” carbon that has been circulating in the air in the</div>
<div>last few years</div>
<div>—</div>
<div>not “old” carbon sequestered millions of</div>
<div>years ago in the coal and oil we now burn. Because of</div>
<div>their deep roots, prairie plants sequester more carbon in</div>
<div>their roots than released in a burn, even in prairies</div>
<div>burned every year. So in balance, prairie plants are a</div>
<div>carbon sink. (Chris Helzer, Nature Conservancy’s Direc-</div>
<div>tor of Science in Nebraska).</div>

<p>Springfield resident Bob Croteau has been involved in local solar projects since 1989 and played a major role in three of the local sites on the tour.</p>
<div class="ad-container"></div>
<p>The Abraham Lincoln Unitarian Universalist Congregation held fundraisers and used members from the church who are contractors to purchase and install their solar array. It has been operational since early 2015, features a web-based remote monitoring system, and &#8220;faces southeast, toward the morning sun, so solar electricity is running the lights and sound during the morning services,&#8221; said Croteau, who spearheaded the effort.</p>
<p>The net metering program offered by CWLP means that &#8220;if we are producing power when we don&#8217;t need it, it allows the meter to spin backward,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="409" data-total-count="750">The vision that Francis outlined in the 184-page encyclical is sweeping in ambition and scope: He described a relentless exploitation and destruction of the environment, for which he blamed apathy, the reckless pursuit of profits, excessive faith in technology and political shortsightedness. The most vulnerable victims are the world’s poorest people, he declared, who are being dislocated and disregarded.</p>
<p>The first pope from the developing world, Francis, an Argentine, used the encyclical — titled “Laudato Si’,” or “Praise Be to You” — to highlight the crisis posed by climate change. He placed most of the blame on fossil fuels and human activity while warning of an “unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequence for all of us” if swift action is not taken. Developed, industrialized countries were mostly responsible, he said, and were obligated to help poorer nations confront the crisis.</p>

<p>With all the recent talk at the federal level about the EPA’s proposed carbon regulations for new and existing power plants, it’s easy to forget about the executives that have front row seats to cutting American carbon pollution. And though climate deniers <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/06/26/2202141/the-anti-science-climate-denier-caucus-113th-congress-edition/">run rampant</a> through the halls of Congress, a <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate-guide-governors/">new analysis</a> from the CAP Action War Room reveals that half of America’s Republican governors agree with the anti-science caucus of Congress.</p>
<p>Fifteen out of twenty-nine sitting Republican governors deny climate science despite the overwhelming level of <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/05/15/2014211/study-finds-97-consensus-on-human-caused-global-warming-in-the-peer-reviewed-literature/">scientific consensus</a>, the <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/report/2013/09/12/73895/states-of-denial-states-with-the-most-federal-disaster-aid-sent-climate-science-deniers-to-congress-2/">enormous cost to taxpayers</a>, and the critical place governors occupy in implementing new limits on carbon pollution. None of the country’s Democratic governors have made public statements denying climate change.</p>
<p>This map from the analysis categorizes governors into four groups: green for those who both accept climate science and are taking action to fight climate change; orange for those who either accept or haven’t openly denied climate science, but also have yet to take serious action to address climate change; red for those who have failed to take action or openly rejected to federal safeguards to address climate change, and red with stripes for climate deniers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>4 years ago at one point there were 17 candidates and I did something insane. I looked at all their energy policies. For over a half month I babbled on about &#8220;this, that or the other&#8221; white paper. Now as an older blogger, I did not even bother. What would be the difference between Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum&#8217;s energy policies. What, Newt wants to find energy on the moon his first year in office. And once it was all over, what is one to say about a guy that says he is for coal. But anyway, here is the Richie Rich&#8217;s energy policy proposals.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mittromney.com/issues/energy">http://www.mittromney.com/issues/energy</a></p>
<h2>Mitt&#8217;s Plan</h2>
<p>As president, Mitt Romney will make every effort to safeguard the environment, but he will be mindful at every step of also protecting the jobs of American workers. This will require putting conservative principles into action.</p>
<p><strong>Significant Regulatory Reform</strong></p>
<p>The first step will be a rational and streamlined approach to regulation, which would facilitate rapid progress in the development of our domestic reserves of oil and natural gas and allow for further investment in nuclear power.</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish fixed timetables for all resource development approvals</li>
<li>Create one-stop shop to streamline permitting process for approval of common activities</li>
<li>Implement fast-track procedures for companies with established safety records to conduct pre-approved activities in pre-approved areas</li>
<li>Ensure that environmental laws properly account for cost in regulatory process</li>
<li>Amend Clean Air Act to exclude carbon dioxide from its purview</li>
<li>Expand NRC capabilities for approval of additional nuclear reactor designs</li>
<li>Streamline NRC processes to ensure that licensing decisions for reactors on or adjacent to approved sites, using approved designs, are complete within two years</li>
</ul>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and read&#8230;if you can stomach it. More tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting &#8220;laid to rest&#8221; is a two part process. There is preparing you and there is the ground you go into. Yesterday I covered the ground you go into part with Roselawn Cemetery which is a dated term I suppose but it is what I know. Today we take a look at the services that get you there. Jenn Bormann is with Butler Funeral Home and she was at Earth Awareness Fest with Clada Parker. They had with them a woven willow casket complete with a basket style top and an optional silk liner. Wow is all I can say. A casket you could leak out of, that is a very winning concept! Sorry I probably wasn&#8217;t supposed to say that but I am a loud mouth sometimes. Anyway I found this story about them in the SJR and I will put up their website as well. I did not want to just copy text from their website, because that is way to commercial for this nonprofit.</p>

<h1>Tim Landis: Butler Funeral Home gets &#8216;green&#8217; certification</h1>
<div><strong>By <a href="mailto:tim.landis@sj-r.com">TIM LANDIS (tim.landis@sj-r.com)</a></strong></div>
<div><a>THE STATE JOURNAL-REGISTER</a></div>
<div title="2010-09-25T23:30:00Z">Posted Sep 25, 2010 @ 11:30 PM</div>
<p>Not only is it possible to go green. Among the newer trends in the funeral home business is going out green.</p>
<p>BUTLER FUNERAL HOMES and ROSELAWN MEMORIAL PARK of Springfield have obtained certification from the national Green Burial Council for sustainable funeral and cemetery practices, eco-friendly products and even organic snacks at the wake.</p>
<p>Butler is getting in early on the green-certification trend as far as central Illinois goes, but president Chris Butler said he expects others to follow.</p>
<p>“Some of this includes elements people are already asking for. They just don’t call it ‘green,’” Butler said of practices that include non-toxic embalming fluids or no embalming at all, using only natural stone, limiting loss of natural habitat, biodegradable caskets, burial shrouds instead of caskets and use of renewable products.</p>
<p>Butler Funeral Homes Inc. is among the city’s older businesses. Forerunner funeral homes date to 1893.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Earth Awareness Fair was this last weekend and I should be reporting on that. But these two women were there, Clada Parker and Jenn Bormann. They are with Roselawn Memorial Park and Butler Funeral home respectively. I am going to do Roselawn today and Butler tomorrow. I just love these guys. They had a woven basket casket with an optional silk liner with them on Saturday. But they have so many options it is real exciting. This is their Facebook page and their website:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Roselawn-Memorial-Park/121946907815445">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Roselawn-Memorial-Park/121946907815445</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.roselawninfo.com/">http://www.roselawninfo.com/</a></p>
<p>And here is a great little write up on them:</p>
<p><a href="http://wakethememory.com/blog/category/cemeteries/">http://wakethememory.com/blog/category/cemeteries/</a></p>
<h2><a title="Permanent Link to Are There Green Cemeteries in Illinois?" href="http://wakethememory.com/blog/are-there-green-cemeteries-in-illinois/" rel="bookmark"> Are There Green Cemeteries in Illinois?</a></h2>
<div>July 19th, 2010</div>
<p>I am happy to report that the answer is finally, <strong>YES</strong>!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Green Burial Council</em> in California recently approved Roselawn Memorial Park for green burials. You can now be buried in Illinois without a casket, without embalming, without anything but a shroud if you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not personally think that a green burial ground has to be approved by the Green Burial Council, but they have some strict standards that make sense, and their mission is great. In a previous life, I worked in the architectural world, and saw first-hand what it was like dealing with the logistics of becoming LEED certified, and know how hard it can be. Additionally, it is very expensive to become “Certified Organic”. I think it’s worthwhile to recognize any cemetery or burial product willing to become more natural, and I will support any company that tries to be better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is their information. They do not seem to have a working website yet. I will keep you posted and update after I contact them directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This all began as a lark. I was bored and could come up with anything interesting that I wanted people to see and think about so I typed in environmental disaster in the google field and picked the one that looked interesting. But it has turned out to be quite fun in a macabre sort of way. Look it is bad enough that Brazil is dozing the rain forest or planting crops in the pantanal; bad enough that they have dammed the Amazon and are running their surface fleet on ethanol. Now they are tossing oil in the ocean.</p>

<div>In yet another environmental disaster, off shore  oil drilling has caused 416,400 litres of oil to flood into the sea  370km (230 miles) off the Brazilian coast.</div>
<div>Chevron claims full responsibility for the disaster that occurred almost 2 weeks ago and has <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-11-20/chevron-says-brazil-oil-spill-reduced-to-residual-seepage.html">made assurances </a>that  the underwater rupture had been sealed although there continued to be  residual oil leaking from undersea rock at the Frade Oil Project.   The international environmental group <a href="http://skytruth.org/">Skytruth</a> suggested the spill was 10 times larger than the official estimate and backed up its claim with satellite images.</div>
<p>The cause of the spill was put down to</p>
<blockquote><p>underestimated  pressure of underwater oil deposits while drilling, causing oil to rush  up the bore hole and seep into the surrounding seabed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Head of the Federal Police Environmental Division Fabio  Scliar voiced concern about the methods Chevron was using to clean up  the spill. He said, Chevron was &#8220;pushing&#8221; the oil to the bottom of the  sea, thereby putting corals in the area at risk of destruction.</p>
<div>
Currently the oil slick originating from the drilling location has  extended over 2,379 square kilometers but is dispersing in a clockwise  eddy by the ocean currents as it drifts further out to sea.</p>

<h1>South African magic rescued climate talks &#8211; Zuma</h1>
<p>Monday 12 December 2011 18:20</p>
<p>A  touch of South African magic rescued the faltering climate talks in  Durban. This is according to President Jacob Zuma who spoke on a state  visit to Benin.</p>
<p>Zuma  says the country defused tensions between parties and prevented its  collapse. &#8220;It was South African magic that actually helped and finally  we emerged with the results that surprised everyone that Durban emerged  with the process. We, as South Africans, should be very proud.&#8221;</p>
<p>An estimated 15 000 delegates attended the conference.</p>
<p>Earlier  today, Environmental Affairs Minister has likened COP 17 to the historic  Kyoto conference in 1997. The Two-week climate talks were aimed at  discussing the future of the planet.</p>
<blockquote><p>The conference moves to Qatar next year</p></blockquote>
