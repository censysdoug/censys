										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More next Fall. HAHA Took me three extra months to return. Sorry did not EVEN think about posting until now.</p>
<p>First, of let me say I am now cancer free. Second, let me say that taking a break away from posting because of the cancer and the cancer treatment left me fairly lazy, so it is tough getting back to writing these posts. The thought has occurred to me that I might retire at the end of the year. Anyway it is good to be back for now. So without further adieu:</p>

Nuclear Power is the pointy rock on tip of the spear and society is a human body. That spear is plunged in to the human body NOT so that it dies, but so it heals. Now whoever controls the shaft of that spear controls the human. THAT is the way the power grid was DESIGNED. To change power grids you have to pull the spear out. The human dies.</p>

<p id="jyKEUO" class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text drop-letter-i"><span role="text"><span class="sr-only">In</span></span> the future, our vehicles and homes will be in constant conversation with the power grid. Smart thermostats will send information about how much energy the home is using or potentially wasting to heat or cool itself. Solar panels will say how much energy they have on hand, while electric vehicles will share information about when and where they’re charging and how much juice they need for their travels. Solar and EV batteries might even offer up the energy they’re storing in case it’s needed elsewhere.</p>
<p id="dcseeR">“You just plug it in, and somehow it automatically talks to its nearest neighbors,” explains Ben Kroposki, a director at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. “[It] says, ‘Hey, I just want to let you know I’m out here. I can provide these kinds of services back.’”</p>
<p id="a6P4n1">That conversation is the backbone of what’s called a “smart grid.” While America’s aging grid system was built to send electricity in one direction — from power plants to homes and businesses — smart grids are a two-way street. Homes and buildings send information and electricity back to the grid or to other homes and buildings. An electric vehicle battery, for example, might be able to provide power to an area in the middle of a blackout. A smart grid also listens for directions from the utility, so that it charges whenever solar or other renewable energy is most abundant.</p>
<p id="4i0kPH">It’s a simple enough idea that for more than a decade has been sold as a way to improve the efficiency, environmental impact, and resiliency of the power sector. But electricity grids still have a long way to go to get “smart.” They’ve managed to fail spectacularly under the stressors of climate change and more extreme weather.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While this article is not click bait per se, the first sentence talks about Roosevelt and WWII. You know, the Big One that he used to take over the economy for almost 10 years. Ask yourself, &#8220;Would any USA President use emergency powers OR The War Powers Act to purge the economy of fossil fuels&#8221;? The real answer is a resounding NO. Then he proceeds to discuss a &#8220;PLAN&#8221; that is more of a &#8220;thought experiment&#8221; or a model with some &#8220;results&#8221;.</p>
<p>None-the-less it is entertaining. And to be fair possible. But somebody has got to light a really really really large fire. Every pun intended.</p>

All of the country’s resources were bent to the task. In 1939, the US had 1,700 aircraft; in 1945, it had 300,000 military aircraft and 18,500 B–24 bombers.</p>
<p id="uRBvdX">By the time the war was won, the economy was up and humming with a massively expanded workforce (drawing in women and African Americans) and turbocharged productive capacity. Investments made during the war mobilization yielded a robust middle class and decades of sustained, broadly shared prosperity.</p>
<p id="SlrMMD">A similar mobilization will be necessary for the US to decarbonize its economy fast enough to avert the worst of climate change. To do its part in limiting global temperature rise to between <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/10/9/17951924/climate-change-global-warming-un-ipcc-report-takeaways">1.5° and 2° Celsius</a>, the US must reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 at the latest. To achieve this, the full resources of the US economy must be bent toward manufacturing the needed clean-energy technology and infrastructure.</p>
<p id="Fyj2J0">FDR began with two questions. First, he asked not what was politically feasible but <em>what was necessary</em> to win the war. He also asked not how much funding was available in the federal budget but how much productive capacity was available in the economy — <em>what was possible</em>.</p>
<p id="ss5u50">Saul Griffith is trying to answer those same questions on climate change: what is necessary, given the trajectory of global warming, and what is possible, given the resources in the US economy.</p>

<p>It is a Vox long read. So go there and read forever. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little house for me is 800 square feet. That&#8217;s what my wife and I have if you discount the storage space and the plant room in the basement. During the spring, summer, and fall months, we spend a lot of time outdoors in are yard or up until March doing other things in other spaces. Whether its an apartment or a rental house, that&#8217;s pretty much the way I have always been. Whether there were one of me or two of us.</p>
<p>The idea that small is better has always seemed to be suspect to me. Anyway, here is one take on the down side of a Tiny House. And yes, I still believe Small is Beautiful.</p>

<p class="body">Tiny houses are everywhere. They’ve received heavy <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2018/04/03/small-but-not-tiny-homes/484295002/">coverage</a> in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jun/26/tiny-home-communities-housing-solution-or-gentrified-trailer-parks">the media</a> and there are <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tinyhousemovement/?hl=en">millions</a> of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tinyhouse/?hl=en">followers</a> on dozens of pages on social media. While there is no census for these homes, they have seen a surge in popularity in the decade since the Great Recession – witness the <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/article/tiny-house-maker-legacy-housing-sets-terms-for-41-million-ipo-cm1063239">prolific growth</a> of tiny house manufacturers, for instance. Originating in the US, tiny homes have also been popping up across Canada, Australia and <a href="http://www.tinyhouseuk.co.uk/">the UK</a>.</p>
<p class="body">Tiny houses are promoted as <a href="https://theconversation.com/tiny-houses-the-big-idea-that-could-take-some-heat-out-of-the-housing-crisis-77295">an answer</a> to the affordable housing crisis; a desirable alternative to traditional homes and mortgages. Yet there are many complexities and contradictions that surround these tiny spaces, as I discovered when I began investigating them.</p>
<p class="body">I have toured homes, attended tiny house festivals, stayed in a tiny house community and interviewed several dozen people who live inside them. My research took me throughout the US, from a converted accessory unit squeezed between two average size homes on Staten Island to a community in Florida full of cute and brightly coloured tiny structures – appropriately located just down the road from Disney World. Here are three things I unexpectedly discovered along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am sure there are thousands of people that are happy with their Tiny Houses. Go there and read. More next week.</p>

<p>Excerpt:</p>
<p>Musk slammed the Bay Area’s shelter-in-place orders as “unconstitutional” and “fascism” in a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/29/elon-musk-slams-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-orders-as-fascist.html">profanity-laced tirade</a> on an earnings call Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>He said: “I think we are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area and that should be identified as a serious risk. We only have two car factories now, one in Shanghai and one in the Bay Area.”</p>
<p>And he continued sounding more and more incensed, at one point asking, “What the f&#8211;k?”</p>
<p>Musk also ranted about the health orders: “I think people are going to be very angry about this and are very angry. It’s like somebody wants to stay in the house? That’s great, they should be allowed to stay in the house, and they should not be compelled to leave. But to say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist. This is not democratic. This is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom.”</p>
<p>(Leaving a place of residence is not a crime in California under Covid-19 health orders.)</p>

<p>Go there and listen to loud shouting. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During this pandemic I have been getting rid of my housitis by driving around in my car. No touching. No talking. Just driving. At first it was close to Riverton, like to Williamsville or places in Springfield like Lincoln Land Community College or Washington Park. One day I thought, &#8220;Let&#8217;s drive to Mt. Pulaski&#8221; which is about 20 miles away maybe. I had forgotten that they had built a wind farm just shy of there. What a glorious sight. Right along the highway. I was amazed. I pulled off the road in wonder. My faith in humanity was renewed.</p>
<p>(I know this is a company site but it has wonderful Pictures. I can neither vouch for this company nor advise any sort of dealings with this company. I am simply reposting its website)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.enelgreenpower.com/stories/a/2019/01/hilltopper-and-sustainable-future-of-energy-with-egp-ppas">https://www.enelgreenpower.com/stories/a/2019/01/hilltopper-and-sustainable-future-of-energy-with-egp-ppas</a></p>
<h1 class="hero_title text--page-heading">HillTopper wind farm creates energy solutions for a sustainable future</h1>
<p class="hero_date text--date">Published on Thursday, 17 January 2019</p>
<p>excerpted:</p>
<h2><b>A Wind Farm “Made in the USA”</b></h2>
<p>Located in <b>Illinois</b>, the US state with the sixth highest installed wind capacity, HillTopper is an example of how our projects contribute to local socio-economic development.</p>
<p>By purchasing wind turbines produced from a local business, HillTopper contributed <b>50 million dollars directly to the local economy</b>: a clear example of the care Enel Green Power has for the communities that welcome us. As Enel Green Power, we provide sustainable, clean, reliable and affordable energy to several companies, with the goal of creating new value in the heart of Illinois.</p>
<p>The 185-MW wind farm uses <b>General Electric</b> turbines manufactured in the United States and, through a collaboration with <b>Trinity Structural Towers</b>, located just a few kilometers from the site, we’re fostering the growth of the local economy.</p>
<p>The local manufacturer provided about half of HillTopper’s 74 turbines. At nearly 90 meters tall, they provide <b>570 GWh</b> of energy every year. This power can cover the energy needs of more than <b>46,300</b> American households.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and read all their corporate speak. But look at the picture and imagine the possibilities. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Does that mean they will stop the Blackouts after the winds reach 40 miles an hour? Does that mean they will go out of business? Or does that mean they will become a nice reasonable caring utility company committed to the community of central California? I got my doubts about the last but we shall see in a year for sure.</p>

<p>In a federal filing Monday permanently documenting its role in causing California’s deadliest wildfire, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric announced it has pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter for the 2018 Camp fire in the Northern California town of Paradise.</p>
<p>PG&amp;E, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said it reached the settlement with the Butte County district attorney’s office on March 17. Under the deal, PG&amp;E said prosecutors won’t pursue further criminal charges, an outcome that disappointed some utility watchdogs.</p>
<p>This is the second time PG&amp;E’s guilt has been established in a wildfire legal proceeding. In 1997, a Nevada County jury <a class="Link" href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/PG-E-Guilty-In-1994-Sierra-Blaze-739-counts-of-2821364.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found the utility guilty of causing a fire</a> three years earlier that burned a dozen homes.</p>
<p>But while this chapter of PG&amp;E’s role in the Camp fire is over, the plea‘s implications for other utilities is less clear, said Shon Hiatt, an associate professor of management and organization at USC’s Marshall School of Business.</p>
