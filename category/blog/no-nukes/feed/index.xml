										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are however safer Nuclear Reactors. But the real drawback is that even France &#8211; that spent 600 million Euro son there&#8217;s &#8211;  gave up their research one 2 years ago.  So Bill Gates may be one of the smartest men on the planet, but for a badly mixed metaphor, he is barking up the wrong tree. Since sodium remains liquid at high temperatures &#8211; instead of turning into steam &#8211; sodium reactors do not need the heavy pressurized hulls of PWRs. But sodium burns on contact with air and explodes when plunged into water. Like I said &#8220;safer&#8221; reactor. Then as always, there is the problem with what to do with the fuel.</p>

<p>KEMMERER, Wyoming (AP) — In this sleepy Wyoming town that has relied on coal for over a century, a company founded by the man who revolutionized personal computing is launching an ambitious project to counter climate change: A nationwide reboot of nuclear energy technology.</p>
<p>Until recently, Kemmerer was little-known for anything except J.C. Penney&#8217;s first store and some 55-million-year-old fish fossils in quarries down the road.</p>
<p>Then in November, a company started by Bill Gates, TerraPower, announced it had chosen Kemmerer for a nontraditional, sodium-cooled nuclear reactor that will bring on workers from a local coal-fired power plant scheduled to close soon.</p>
<p>The demonstration project comes as many U.S. states see <a class="link " href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-business-environment-and-nature-bill-gates-nuclear-power-90689f06e1cf0271710e07e8b3ba8e09" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:nuclear emerging as an answer to fill the gap" data-rapid_p="8" data-v9y="1">nuclear emerging as an answer to fill the gap</a> as a transition away from coal, oil and natural gas to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Many residents in Kemmerer, where the population of 2,700 is little-changed since the 1990s, see the TerraPower project as a much-needed economic boost because Rocky Mountain Power&#8217;s Naughton power plant will close 2025. The plant employs about 230 and a mine that supplies coal exclusively to the plant — and is also at risk of closing if it can&#8217;t find another customer — almost 300.</p>

<p>LACEY TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) — For the second time in as many months, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has fined the owners of a former New Jersey nuclear power plant for security-related violations.</p>
<p>The agency said Wednesday it fined Jupiter, Florida-based Holtec Decommissioning International $50,000 for security violations at the former Oyster Creek nuclear power plant in the Forked River section of Lacey Township.</p>
<p>The plant was one of the oldest in the U.S. when it shut down in 2018.</p>
<p>The fine involved a company employee working as an armorer at the plant.</p>
<p>In an investigation that concluded in March 2021, the NRC determined the armorer “deliberately failed to properly perform required annual material-condition inspections of response unit rifles, and falsified related records.”</p>
<p>The plant has several fortified bunkers from which armed security staff can fight off attackers. The NRC said the violation was the work of “a now-former security superintendent.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What genius decided to put Hanford Nuclear Site so close to the Columbia River that it is about to ruin it for good? Actually whose idea was it to put in a river valley in the first place? They really could have done a much better job. I mean look at the other World War II sites like Tennessee and New Mexico. It is almost collectively like they said, &#8221; Heh&#8217; lets do something like Rocky Mountain Flats in Denver.  But we well do it better&#8221;. And now after 80 years and one 12 story failed attempt, they are &#8220;excited to get going&#8221; with the attempted clean up. Sometimes I do not want to admit I am part of the Human race. sigh.</p>

<p>Hanford officials say that will be a historic moment.</p>
<div class="caas-da">
<div id="sda-INARTICLE"></div>
</div>
<p>“Being on the verge of the first use of large scale tank waste treatment on the Hanford site is pretty doggone exciting,” said John Eschenberg, president of Hanford’s tank waste contractor, Washington River Protection Solution.</p>
<p>The Department of Energy announced on Tuesday that construction and the readiness assessment of the Tank-Side Cesium Removal. or TSCR, system at Hanford had been completed.</p>
<p>“What a lot of people don’t recognize is the start of tank waste treatment actually starts when TSCR operations begin, so we will be actually treating waste on the industrial scale in just a few months for the first time in the history of the site,” said Brian Vance, the DOE Hanford manager.</p>
<p>The system, placed next to a Hanford underground waste storage tank, was developed in three years as a workaround to the Pretreatment Facility, which stands 12 stories high and covers an area larger than a football field at the vitrification plant.</p>
<p>The Pretreatment Facility was planned to separate waste into low-activity and high-level radioactive waste streams for treatment, but after possible technical issues related to high level waste were identified in 2012, construction on the building stopped.</p>
<p>DOE changed course, deciding to start treating just low activity radioactive waste first and delay treatment of high level radioactive waste for more than a decade.</p>
<p>It estimates that about 90% of the waste in underground tanks could be treated and disposed of in a lined landfill at Hanford as low activity waste.</p>

This administration is so OLD it is frightening. (quick aside &#8211; like for the last 100 yrs &#8211; how do get rid of the waste?)</p>

<p>GLASGOW, Scotland — In an interview at the U.N. Climate Change Conference, Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm told Yahoo News on Friday that the Biden administration is “very bullish” on building new nuclear reactors in the United States.</p>
<p>“We are very bullish on these advanced nuclear reactors,” she said. “We have, in fact, invested a lot of money in the research and development of those. We are very supportive of that.”</p>
<p>Nuclear energy is controversial among environmental activists and experts because while it does not create the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change, it has the potential to trigger dangerous nuclear meltdowns and creates radioactive nuclear waste.</p>
<p>Most of the Biden administration’s effort to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and almost all the rhetoric at the climate change conference, also known as COP26, is about promoting other clean forms of energy, such as wind and solar power.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nuclear Power was always too EXpensive to meter. But when the Nuclear Choo-Choo Train got going in the 60s everyone was in love with the new technology, the marvelous future, how many decades the plants could run and the massive power produced that the regulators publicly patted the Utility Guys on the back and quietly passed the costs on to ratepayers. This is what should have happened from the very beginning.</p>

<h1 data-test-locator="headline">Failed nuclear contractor signs $21M deal, working with feds</h1>
<p>The chief contractor at a failed multibillion-dollar project to build two nuclear reactors in South Carolina has agreed to pay more than $20 million as part of a cooperation agreement with federal authorities probing the fiasco.</p>
<p>Under an agreement announced Monday by Acting U.S. Attorney Rhett DeHart, Westinghouse Electric Co. will contribute $5 million to a program intended to assist low-income ratepayers affected by the project’s failure. Another payment of $16.25 million will be due before July 1, 2022.</p>
<p>The company will also be required to cooperate with federal investigators still probing the company&#8217;s role in the 2017 debacle, which cost ratepayers and investors billions and left nearly 6,000 people jobless.</p>

<p>A second high-ranking employee of Westinghouse Electric is facing criminal charges in connection with the multi-billion dollar failure of the doomed nuclear project in Fairfield County.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Benjamin, a former Westinghouse senior vice president of new plants and projects, faces multiple counts of fraud, according to an 18-page indictment made public Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Columbia.</p>
<p>It is the latest criminal charge in a four-year federal investigation of what went wrong at the highest levels of two substantial American companies — Westinghouse and the former SCANA Corporation.</p>
<div class="caas-da">
<div id="sda-INARTICLE"></div>
</div>
<p>The charges against Benjamin are “for his role in failing to truthfully report information regarding construction of new nuclear units at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant,” Acting U.S. Attorney Rhett DeHart said in a <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://twitter.com/USAO_SC/status/1428082981189701641?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:press release" data-rapid_p="6" data-v9y="1">press release</a>.</p>
<p>Benjamin’s alleged cover-up of billions of dollars in losses at Westinghouse’s troubled nuclear plants in South Carolina and Georgia were part of a series of events leading to the company’s bankruptcy in March 2017, according to the indictment.</p>
<p>“The defendant’s misrepresentations and omissions, as well as the associated cover-up, resulted in billions of dollars in losses to (SCANA), ratepayers and investors,” the indictment said.</p>

<p>MOSCOW (AP) — Belarus&#8217; first nuclear power plant began operating Tuesday, a project that has spooked its neighbor Lithuania, which immediately cut off importing electricity from Belarus at the news.</p>
<p>The Russian-built Astravyets nuclear power plant, 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, has been connected to Belarus&#8217; power grid and has started producing electricity, according to Belarusian electricity operator Belenergo.</p>
<p>Lithuanian authorities long have opposed the plant&#8217;s construction, arguing that the project has been plagued by accidents, stolen materials and the mistreatment of workers. In line with the country&#8217;s law banning electricity imports from Belarus once the plant starts, Lithuania&#8217;s Litgrid power operator cut the inflow of electricity from Belarus upon receiving data that the Astravyets nuclear reactor had started producing energy.</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s state nuclear corporation Rosatom, which built the plant, has rejected the Lithuanian complaints, saying the plant&#8217;s design conforms to the highest international standards as confirmed by the International Atomic Energy Agency, a U.N. watchdog.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chernobyl symbolized the beginning of the end for me. Man had shown his weakness against forces that he unleashed on the Earth. If that was true then it was only a matter of time before the jinny or jin coalesced and demanded his due. The sum of which men could not produce. So the sword would fall on all our necks. But every once in awhile there is cause for hope.</p>

<p class="body">The effects of the radioactive explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on April 26, 1986 devastated the environment. Around the plant and in the nearby city of Pripyat in Ukraine, the Chernobyl disaster’s radiation caused the leaves of thousands of trees to turn a rust color, giving a new name to the surrounding woods—the <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/56235-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-33-years-later-wildlife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Forest</a>.

Though experts today believe parts of the zone will remain unsafe for humans for another <a href="https://www.livescience.com/39961-chernobyl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20,000 years</a>, numerous animal and plant species not only survived, but thrived.</p>
<h2 class="body title">2. Bears and Wolves Outnumber Humans Around the Chernobyl Disaster Site</h2>
<p class="body">While humans are strictly prohibited from living in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, many other species have settled there.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chernobyl and Fukushima released a lot of radiation. People died from the severe radiation released just after the accident, but &#8220;mild&#8221; consistent radiation is not dangerous to animals though it may have mild effects on adults and bigger effects on children. But the idea that a major radiation release would create one eyed giant humans or fire breathing dragons like wadzzilla is really remote. The fear of radiation has done some pretty amazing things for the environment, however.</p>
