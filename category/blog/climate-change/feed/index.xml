										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have come to despise Joe Machin. The entire Senate turns on whether he will vote for something. He has derailed the stringent Climate Change provisions of Built Back Better bill, and acted like it was a boon that he voted for a Black Woman to the Supreme Court. He is a waste of human space. Joe Manchin helped a West Virginia power plant that is the sole customer of his private coal business. Along the way, he blocked ambitious climate action.</p>

<p>This article is from the NY Times but its tagline would not load up so I used the one above. from politico. I think if you click on the author you may get through. In fact I clicked on the active author link and it took me right through so you get 2 articles for the nonprice of 1.</p>

<p class="css-g5piaz evys1bk0">GRANT TOWN, W.Va. — On a hilltop overlooking Paw Paw Creek, 15 miles south of the Pennsylvania border, looms a fortresslike structure with a single smokestack, the only viable business in a dying Appalachian town.</p>
<p class="css-g5piaz evys1bk0">The Grant Town power plant is also the link between the coal industry and the personal finances of Joe Manchin III, the Democrat who rose through state politics to reach the United States Senate, where, through the vagaries of electoral politics, he is now <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/climate/manchin-climate-biden.html?searchResultPosition=21">the single most important figure</a> shaping the nation’s energy and climate policy.</p>
<p class="css-g5piaz evys1bk0">Mr. Manchin’s ties to the Grant Town plant date to 1987, when he had just been elected to the West Virginia Senate, a part-time job with base pay of $6,500. His family’s carpet business was struggling.</p>
<p class="css-g5piaz evys1bk0">Opportunity arrived in the form of two developers who wanted to build a power plant in Grant Town, just outside Mr. Manchin’s district. Mr. Manchin, whose grandfather went to work in the mines at age 9 and whose uncle died in a mining accident, helped the developers clear bureaucratic hurdles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This could become a heated and useless discussion. One that goes back centuries. To be blunt &#8211; Are we molly coddling the little beggars. Lets face it, on one level life has improved immeasurably. Life expectancies, just as an example, show how less brutal life is; and total global populations show how plentiful general life support is. I guess the real question here is, do you believe that global warming will make Earth uninhabitable for humans? If the answer is YES to that question, AND something could be done to change that &#8211; then you have an obligations to say something. If the answer is No and NO then I guess &#8211; Shut Up. But is it that easy?</p>

</div>
<div class="content-header__row content-header__accreditation" data-testid="ContentHeaderAccreditation">
<div class="content-header__row content-header__dek">Many young people feel like their future is in peril. To make progress on climate change, we must move past doomsday scenarios.</div>
</div>
<p>Is climate change the biggest threat to humanity? Many people would say so. Young people in particular feel hopeless. A <a class="external-link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3918955" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3918955" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3918955&quot;}">recent survey</a> asked 10,000 16- to 25-year-olds in 10 countries about their attitudes about climate change. The results were damning. More than half said “humanity was doomed”; three-quarters said the future was frightening; 55 percent said they would have less opportunities than their parents; 52 percent said family security would be threatened; and 39 percent were hesitant to have children as a result. These attitudes were consistent across countries rich and poor, big and small: from the United States and the United Kingdom to Brazil, the Philippines, India, and Nigeria.</p>
<p>It’s totally legitimate that young people feel this way. I’ve been there. Today, much of my work focuses on researching, writing, and thinking about climate change. But it’s a field I very nearly walked away from. Fresh out of university with a degree in environmental science and climate change, it was hard to see that I could contribute anything at all. I flipped back and forth between anger and hopelessness. Any effort seemed futile, and I nearly quit. Thankfully my perspective shifted. I’m glad it did. Not only did I continue working on climate, I’m also sure that my work has had many times the positive impact it would have if I’d been stuck in my previous mindset. And that’s why I’m convinced that if we’re to make progress on climate, we need to lift this cloak of pessimism.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear: Climate change is one of the biggest problems we face. It comes with many risks—some certain, some uncertain—and we’re not moving anywhere near fast enough to reduce emissions. But there seems to have been a breakdown in communication of what our future entails. None of the climate scientists I know and trust—who surely know the risks better than almost anyone—are resigned to a future of oblivion. Most of them have children. In fact, they often have several. Young ones, too. Now, having kids is no automatic qualification for rational decision-making. But it signals that those who spend day after day studying climate change are optimistic that their children will have a life worth living.</p>

<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden called out two fellow Democrats on Tuesday in explaining why he hasn’t enacted some of the most ambitious elements of his agenda, noting that slim majorities in the House and evenly divided Senate have hamstrung legislative negotiations around key issues like voting rights.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">Biden, speaking during an event marking the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre, responded to critics who question why he hasn’t been able to get a wide-reaching voting rights bill passed.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">“Well, because Biden only has a majority of effectively four votes in the House, and a tie in the Senate — with two members of the Senate who voted more with my Republican friends,” he lamented.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-61 Component-p-0-2-52">It appeared to be a veiled reference to Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, both of whom have frustrated Democrats with their defense of the filibuster — the rule requiring most legislation to win 60 votes to pass, making many of Democrats’ biggest priorities like voting rights and gun control bills dead on arrival in the 50-50 Senate. While Sinema is a sponsor of the voting rights bill that passed the House, known as the For the People Act, Manchin has refused to sign on, calling the measure “too broad.</p>

<p>He is not even a Democrat. He is a DINO: Democrat In Name Only. He knows the majority is thin and thus his power is great. So behind the flag of Fiscal Responsibility he argues for a smaller bill. A Bill that can &#8220;get paid for&#8221;. What gets dropped out of that smaller bill? Surprise! Surprise! The Climate Change program that his coal sucking buddies hate.

<p class="has-dropcap">Although <strong>Joe Manchin</strong> has been holding up <strong>Joe Biden</strong>’s infrastructure plans for a while now over the price tag, the West Virginia senator has been somewhat cagey about his actual demands. Not as guarded, perhaps, as <strong>Kyrsten Sinema</strong>, his fellow Democratic holdout; where she has <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/09/what-exactly-does-kyrsten-sinema-want">refused</a> to state her terms to anyone outside the White House, Manchin at least engages with his colleagues and speaks publicly about his objections to the reconciliation bill. But he’s been difficult to pin down nonetheless, adding to the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/nancy-pelosi-democrats-infrastructure-deal">frustrations</a> of Democrats as they seek to deliver on the centerpiece of Biden’s domestic agenda.</p>

Manchin is asking for the credit to include a work requirement and an income cap that would make families earning more than $60,000 ineligible for assistance—a demand that would weaken a key part of the spending bill. He is also, as Axios reported, continuing to rail against provisions of the reconciliation bill that are crucial to addressing climate change, <a class="external-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/climate/manchin-climate-biden.html?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20211017&amp;instance_id=43090&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;regi_id=56298477&amp;segment_id=71906&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=2abb12c11b787f32a2358bbfc4aeefd0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/climate/manchin-climate-biden.html?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20211017&amp;instance_id=43090&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;regi_id=56298477&amp;segment_id=71906&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=2abb12c11b787f32a2358bbfc4aeefd0" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/climate/manchin-climate-biden.html?campaign_id=9&amp;emc=edit_nn_20211017&amp;instance_id=43090&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;regi_id=56298477&amp;segment_id=71906&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=2abb12c11b787f32a2358bbfc4aeefd0&quot;}">supposedly</a> because of concerns that the shift to clean energy the Biden plan would help usher in could cost jobs in the coal state of West Virginia.

<p>Yah I know Nobody Ever Said That. I thought it was a cool lead, or as they say cool lede, now. AND I know Antarctica is hard to care about. It&#8217;s just like Greenland. So what if it melts. I live in the mid west. When we flood, the world will really be flooded. No Florida, no Louisiana, no Southern Georgia, and no Southern Alabama and Mississippi. AND no Beaches.</p>

<p class="body"><em>This is a dispatch in a series from Jeff Goodell, who was aboard the Nathaniel B. Palmer in Antarctica <em class="gjs-comp-selected" data-highlightable="1"> in 2019 </em>, investigating <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/journey-to-antarctica/" data-highlightable="1">the effect of climate change on Thwaites glacier</a>.<br data-highlightable="1" /><br data-highlightable="1" /></em>Yesterday, the <em>Nathaniel B. Palmer</em> left Antarctica behind and made the turn toward home. The last science experiments were completed, and the ship headed north, toward Punta Arenas, Chile, where our two-month journey will end. Scientists on board are packing up equipment and writing rough drafts of papers based on discoveries they made during our adventure into uncharted waters around Thwaites glacier. But an almost existential question looms above it all: Did we just witness what amounts to a climate catastrophe playing out in real time?</p>

<p>On March 3rd, 2019, Bastien Queste, an oceanographer at the University of East Anglia who is a key member of the science team aboard the ship, got a WhatsApp message from a colleague back in the UK. She had sent him a satellite image of Thwaites glacier and the surrounding region in West Antarctica. At the time, we had just completed <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/antarctica-thwaites-doomsday-glacier-goodell-801622/" data-highlightable="1">our own close encounter</a> with the awesome craggy blue glacier and were only a few miles away, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/journey-to-antarctica-mapping-thwaites-goodell-803526/" data-highlightable="1">mapping</a> the seabed in front of the glacier with the ship’s sonar device.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just like CANCER. That was the first thought I had when I read this article. Evidence was gathered 60 years ago. People spoke up, and the oil and gas industry killed any discussion. Now we are stuck with more powerful Hurricanes. We are stuck with the American west being consumed by droughts and fire. The Arctic is gone and the Antarctic going. The world should confiscate their wealth and apply every dime to remediating the effects. Unfortunately the whole world never does anything. I mean the UN could pass a resolution but Pfffhh.</p>

The diagnosis was dramatic. It warned of the emergence of a new era of weird weather, leading to political unrest and mass migration (which, in turn, would cause more unrest). The new era the agency imagined wasn’t necessarily one of hotter temperatures; the CIA had heard from scientists warning of global cooling as well as warming. But the direction in which the thermometer was traveling wasn’t their immediate concern; it was the political impact. They knew that the so-called “<a title="" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/29/little-ice-age" data-link-name="in body link">little ice age</a>”, a series of cold snaps between, roughly, 1350 and 1850, had brought not only drought and famine, but also war – and so could these new climatic changes.</span></p>
<p class="dcr-s23rjr">“The climate change began in 1960,” the report’s first page informs us, “but no one, including the climatologists, recognized it.” Crop failures in the Soviet Union and India in the early 1960s had been attributed to standard unlucky weather. The US shipped grain to India and the Soviets killed off livestock to eat, “and premier Nikita Khrushchev was quietly deposed”.</p>
<p class="dcr-s23rjr">But, the report argued, the world ignored this warning, as the global population continued to grow and states made massive investments in energy, technology and medicine.</p>

As you continue into the Cascade Range, you pass through sparser forests dominated by Ponderosa pines. These tall, slender trees with prickly cones thrive in the hotter, drier conditions on the eastern side of the state.</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">All trees consume carbon dioxide, releasing the oxygen and storing the carbon in their trunks, branches and roots. Every ton of carbon sequestered in a living tree is a ton that isn’t contributing to climate change. And that thick coastal forest can easily store twice as much carbon per acre as the trees deeper inland.</p>

<p>An emergency is a serious situation that requires immediate action. When someone calls 911 because they can’t breathe, that’s an emergency. When someone stumbles on the sidewalk because their chest is pounding and their lips are turning blue, that’s an emergency. Both people require help right away. Multiply those individuals by millions of people who have similar symptoms, and it constitutes the biggest global health emergency in a century: the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Now consider the following scenarios: A hurricane blasts Florida. A California dam bursts because floods have piled water high up behind it. A sudden, record-setting cold snap cuts power to the entire state of Texas. These are also emergencies that require immediate action. Multiply these situations worldwide, and you have the biggest environmental emergency to beset the earth in millennia: climate change.</p>
<p>Given the circumstances,<em> Scientific American</em> has agreed with major news outlets worldwide to start using the term “climate emergency” in its coverage of climate change. An official statement about this decision, and the impact we hope it can have throughout the media landscape, is below.</p>
<p><em>The planet is heating up way too fast. It’s time for journalism to recognize that the climate emergency is here</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If Schumer could pull this off I would be &#8220;dancin in the streets&#8221;. It would not be as good and banning Airline Flights, but heh I will take whatever I can get. It would be really good for the lower level atmosphere and especially good for bodies of water, whether flowing bodies like rivers or standing bodies like lakes or oceans. Unfortunately, the upper atmosphere is where the real global warming is taking place. Still &#8211; I am not minimizing this. IT be good.</p>

<p class="c-entry-summary p-dek">The Senate majority leader is reviving his plan to give people discounts for swapping their gas car for an electric one</p>

<p id="UnXkqU" class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text drop-letter-w"><span role="text"><span class="sr-only"><strong>W</strong>ith</span></span> the $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill signed into law, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is ready to tackle the next major challenge: President Joe Biden’s call for a massive infrastructure bill. As part of that package, Schumer said he plans to include his ambitious proposal to get every American to swap their gas-guzzling car for an electric one.</p>
<p id="4s4nuu">“It’s a bold new plan designed to accelerate America’s transition to all electric vehicles on the road, to developing a charging infrastructure, and to grow American jobs through clean manufacturing,” Schumer told <em>The Verge</em> in a brief interview this week. “And the ultimate goal is to have every car manufactured in America be electric by 2030, and every car on the road be clean by 2040.”</p>
<p id="9dBBWh">The top-line details of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931983/schumer-electric-car-trade-in-gas-discount-proposal-zero-emission">“cash for clunkers’’-style plan</a> haven’t changed much since Schumer first proposed it in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/opinion/chuck-schumer-electric-car.html">an op-ed in <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em> in late 2019</a>. But the political landscape has certainly shifted in favor of the Democrats, breathing new life into the idea. Under the proposal, anyone who trades in their gas car for an electric one would get a “substantial” point-of-sale discount, Schumer says. He wouldn’t say how much of a discount, only that it would be “deep.” A spokesperson later confirmed they are eyeing rebates that are “more generous” than the current $7,500 federal EV tax credit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the atmosphere is so gunked up and the ocean so full of crap then the currents both in the atmosphere and the ocean slow down and eventually stop. At that point we all die. End game. Checkmate. But here I&#8217;ll let these people tell you in more technical language. I am sure if you don&#8217;t believe me, you will believe them.</p>

<h1>Atlantic currents seem to have started fading last century</h1>
<h2>Another predicted impact of climate change may be here.</h2>

<p>The major currents in the Atlantic Ocean help control the climate by moving warm surface waters north and south from the equator, with colder deep water pushing back toward the equator from the poles. The presence of that warm surface water plays a key role in moderating the climate in the North Atlantic, giving places like the UK a far more moderate climate than its location—the equivalent of northern Ontario—would otherwise dictate.</p>
<p>But the temperature differences that drive that flow are expected to fade as our climate continues to warm. A bit over a decade ago, measurements of the currents seemed to be indicating that temperatures were dropping, suggesting that we might be seeing these predictions come to pass. But a few years later, it became clear that there was just too much year-to-year variation for us to tell.</p>
<p>Over time, however, researchers have figured out ways of getting indirect measures of the currents, using material that is influenced by the strengths of the water&#8217;s flow. These measures have now let us look back on the current&#8217;s behavior over the past several centuries. And the results confirm that the strength of the currents has dropped dramatically over the last century.</p>
