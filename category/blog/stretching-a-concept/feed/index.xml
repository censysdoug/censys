In the 1980s, it cost about $18 billion a year to clean up after climate disasters. Then the extreme weather intensified, so the costs ballooned. In the 1990s, we spent about $27 billion annually to clean up. In the 2000s, it cost almost $52 billion annually. In the 2010s, cleanup costs exploded to $81 billion. Then in the last five years, we&#8217;ve spent a whopping $121 billion per year to clean up after an angry Mother Nature.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the shell game for the oil companies was always &#8211; who can we get to take this stuff? Meaning solid supposedly recyclable plastics. For awhile anybody would take the &#8220;stuff&#8221; to burn it and Americans are like &#8211; out of sight out of mind. When they got caught at that, then they started exporting for &#8220;conversion&#8221; to other substances and China bought that one big time. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, plastic can be recycled but it is MORE expensive to do so than to throw it away. PLUS you can only recycle it once or twice and then it has to be thrown away anyway. YUP recycling was always a lie. But ain&#8217;t capitalism grand.</p>

<p>Laura Leebrick, a manager at Rogue Disposal &amp; Recycling in southern Oregon, is standing on the end of its landfill watching an avalanche of plastic trash pour out of a semitrailer: containers, bags, packaging, strawberry containers, yogurt cups.</p>
<p>None of this plastic will be turned into new plastic things. All of it is buried.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me that felt like it was a betrayal of the public trust,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I had been lying to people &#8230; unwittingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rogue, like most recycling companies, had been sending plastic trash to China, but when China shut its doors two years ago, Leebrick scoured the U.S. for buyers. She could find only someone who wanted white milk jugs. She sends the soda bottles to the state.</p>
<p>But when Leebrick tried to tell people the truth about burying all the other plastic, she says people didn&#8217;t want to hear it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember the first meeting where I actually told a city council that it was costing more to recycle than it was to dispose of the same material as garbage,&#8221; she says, &#8220;and it was like heresy had been spoken in the room: You&#8217;re lying. This is gold. We take the time to clean it, take the labels off, separate it and put it here. It&#8217;s gold. This is valuable.&#8221;</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and read. Next time you see an empty gallon milk jug. Light it on fire in protest. More next week.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>P.S. Today is recycling day in Riverton and they just took my plastic away. hahahahaa</p>

<h1>Warren Buffett and casino boss Sheldon Adelson clash in Nevada over electricity</h1>
<p>by Trevor Hunnicutt</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong> | Casino magnate <a href="https://www.afr.com/news/world/north-america/elon-musk-just-gave-almost-us40000-to-republicanallied-group-20180715-h12q03">Sheldon Adelson</a> and investor <a href="https://www.afr.com/personal-finance/why-warren-buffett-likes-apple-20180930-h162k3">Warren Buffett</a> are set for a desert showdown over electricity next week as the two billionaires&#8217; interests collide on election ballots in Nevada.</p>
<p>At issue in the November 6 election is the cost and control of power from the neon lights shining on the Las Vegas Strip to the state&#8217;s gold mines.</p>
<p data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-7770372_137="3869" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time-7770372_137="4000" data-gtm-vis-has-fired-7770372_137="1">A measure supported by Republican donor Adelson, who is also Las Vegas Sands Corp&#8217;s chairman, would force state legislators to break up control over much of the state&#8217;s electricity in effect held by a unit of Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway, NV Energy. It would allow customers to choose their own power provider by 2023.</p>
<p>Buffett has supported liberal causes and backed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p>
<p>Unlike previous western duels, both sides in Nevada are showing up with cash. The energy tussle is shaping up as one of the more costly of an election season in which Democrats are trying to wrest control of at least one chamber of US Congress from Republicans.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and decide for yourself. More next week.:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the years I have gotten 100s of requests to post links with other Blogs and Internet Sites that are related to the things that I post about; Sometimes tangentially. Sometimes very tangentially. Below I am going to try to post some of those with the text of the request where applicable or sometimes just the link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am only one guy by the way. That is it, Community Energy Systems and Energy Tough Love is just one guy with 900 bucks in the bank&#8230;.so there is no way I can track down each post of mine and put the link on the page. Did I mention I was 63 years old. I would be dead by the time i did 10 or 20 post. Is some of this sarcastic? Well yah. But I never mean it spitefully. Please laugh with me not at me. Consider this:</p>
<p>Hello ,</p>
<p>My name is James Giraldo and I’m the Communications Manager on SaveOnEnergy.com®.</p>
<p>I wanted to point out this page: <a href="/censys/?m=200810" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">censys.org</a> which links to a broken kids energy page on <a href="http://www.miamisci.org/af/sln/frankenstein/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">miamisci.org</a></p>
<p>Our team has created a <a href="https://www.saveonenergy.com/kids-learning-center/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kids Learning Center</a> which is filled with free resources similar to the ones previously found on that page. Please take a look, and if you find any of the content useful consider linking to it on your page, or perhaps use it to replace the broken link so your visitors don&#8217;t end up on that broken page.</p>
<p>Here is a hyperlink to our kids learning center:<br />
<a href="https://www.saveonenergy.com/kids-learning-center/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.saveonenergy.com/kids-learning-center/</a></p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your help and attention. Please let me know if you have questions or concerns that I can assist with.</p>

<p>Or this:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Hi censys.org,</span></p>
<p>I was reading a page on your site and I noticed you had link pointing to a page that is broken (no longer valid) which I thought you might want to fix.</p>
<p>The broken link can be found at the middle of the page.  The page that has the broken link is:</p>
<p><a href="/censys/index.php?s=energy&amp;paged=27" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">/censys/index.php?s=energy&amp;paged=27</a></p>
<p>Attached is a screenshot with a circle around the broken link to make it easier to find.</p>
<p>Having broken links on your site isn’t good for your readers and also Google lowers your ranking score if you have them.  It would be awesome if you could replace the broken link with one of our related posts instead, if not, that is okay.</p>
<p><span class="u_b en_0 C4_Z2aVTcY" data-test-id="message-from"><span class="D_F rtlI_rtlI_dz_sSg "><span class="u_N C_Z1VRpVF"><a href="http:www.businesselectric.com">http:www.businesselectric.com</a></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
If you would replace it with our link we would share the post with 14,000+ followers in our niche.  We are up for collaborating more with you or negotiating more about it.</span></p>
<p>Thanks for reading my email and have a nice day ?</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia has a plan to wean its economy off oil. In the biggest sign of what the future of the Gulf state would look like, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, has signed a memorandum of understanding with Japanese multinational Softbank to build 200 GW of solar power by 2030 at a cost of $200 billion.</p>
<p>These are eye-popping numbers. If built, that solar-power plant will be about 200 times the size of the biggest solar plant operating today. It would more than triple Saudi Arabia’s capacity to produce electricity, from about 77 GW today.</p>
<p>With current technology, solar panels capable of generating 200 GW would likely cover 5,000 sq km—an area larger than the the world’s largest cities.</p>

<h1>Worst-hit reactor at Fukushima may be easiest to clean up</h1>
<div class="author">By MARI YAMAGUCHI Associated Press</div>
<div class="date"><time class="asset-date text-muted" datetime="2018-01-30T19:48:17-06:00">4 hrs ago</time></div>
<p>OKUMA, Japan (AP) — High atop Fukushima&#8217;s most damaged nuclear reactor, the final pieces of a jelly-roll shaped cover are being put in place to seal in highly radioactive dust.</p>
<p>Blown apart by a hydrogen explosion in 2011 after an earthquake and tsunami hit Japan&#8217;s Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, reactor Unit 3 is undergoing painstaking construction ahead of a milestone that is the first step toward dismantling the plant.</p>
<p>The operating floor — from where new fuel rods used to be lowered into the core — has been rebuilt and if all goes as planned, huge cranes will begin removing 566 sets of still-radioactive fuel rods from a storage pool just below it later this year.</p>
<p>It has taken seven years just to get this far, but now the real work of cleaning up the Tokyo Electric Power Co. plant can begin.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you compare it with mountain climbing, we&#8217;ve only been preparing to climb. Now, we finally get to actually start climbing,&#8221; said Daisuke Hirose, an official at the plant&#8217;s decommissioning and decontamination unit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People have always said the Donald Trump was smart as a fox. Or that his antics distract from what he really wants, and that he ALways gets what he wants. It has even been said that he is like a major league hitter who whiffs sometimes but hits out of the park enough to have a great average. I think he is just a dumb ass with a lot of money to cover up his mistakes. This is such a doozy that ain&#8217;t no mount of money gonna make up for it. Even the conservatives agree.</p>

<p>The Corner The one and only. ‘Taking Us to the Cleaners’</p>
<p>by Veronique de Rugy January 24, 2018 1:36 PM</p>
<p>The title of this post comes from the great Don Boudreaux, professor of economics and a free-trade warrior, over at Cafe Hayek.</p>
<p>It is the perfect soundbite to the Trump administration’s decision to impose a penalty on Americans who buy foreign-made solar panels and washers. The administration, of course, doesn’t call it that. Instead, it calls it a 30 percent tariff of solar panels and imported washers to protect our domestic manufactures.</p>
<p>Here is what the the solar protection looks like: &#8221; The solar trade protection — which applies to solar panels as well as cells, the piece of equipment that converts sunlight into electricity — is a 30% tariff in the first year, declining to 15% by a fourth year. The first 2.5 gigawatts of cells imported annually is exempt from the tariff.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a perfect example of the profound deficiencies in the process that leads to applying a tariff, which I wrote about last week. The Wall Street Journal reports: &#8220;The solar tariff is a response to a petition filed at the International Trade Commission by two U.S.-based manufacturers — Chinese-owned Suniva, which filed for bankruptcy last year, and German-owned SolarWorld Americas, whose parent company filed for bankruptcy last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and read. More next week.</p>

<h1 class="title">Florida Nuke Plant Did Not Meet Fed Safety Guidelines as Irma Roared</h1>
<div class="byline">By <span class="author"> <a class="author-name" href="http://www.newsweek.com/authors/melina-delkic" rel="author">Melina Delkic</a> </span> <time datetime="2017-09-11T22:01:15-04:00"> On 9/11/17 at 10:01 PM </time></div>
<p><em>Update</em> | Operators of a nuclear power plant in the path of Hurricane Irma kept one reactor operating during the cyclone, although the plant had not finished meeting stricter federal safety requirements implemented after Japan&#8217;s Fukushima accident.</p>
<p>The Turkey Point nuclear plant in Homestead, along the southeast Florida coast, experienced an unrelated failure in one reactor&#8217;s cooling system during the storm. A part called the steam generator&#8217;s feed regulating valve failed on Sunday night, prompting engineers to shut down the reactor.</p>
<p>The cooling system malfunction did not cause any radiation leakage, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p>
<p>The failure of the valve at Turkey Point was unrelated to larger, federally mandated improvements that are still pending, including improving seals on exterior doors and improving floodwater drainage mechanisms near &#8220;key&#8221; cooling pumps, according to a flood- and hurricane-preparedness report the power plant sent to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in June — a requirement of <a href="https://www.nei.org/Issues-Policy/Safety-and-Security/Fukushima-Response" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">post-Fukushima regulations</a>.</p>
