<p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">One hundred years ago, Congress passed the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, setting up a system in which companies lease public lands to wrest valuable oil and gas from the ground. In the century since, the royalties and rent that those corporations pay to the American people for access have remained essentially unchanged even as the scale of development and profits has grown hugely.</p>
<p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">As senators from different parties, we have our share of policy differences. But we both believe in sticking up for the public interest and the taxpayer. In this case, we agree that oil and gas companies should pay fair market value for the public resources they extract and sell. They aren’t doing that now — not even close — and the American public is the big loser.</p>
<p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">That’s why we <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.tomudall.senate.gov/news/press-releases/udall-grassley-introduce-bill-to-ensure-taxpayers-get-fair-share-for-public-lands-leasing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced the Fair Returns for Public Lands Act</a> this year to reform the antiquated law that governs royalties and the leasing of public land.</p>
<p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The country’s economy and the oil and gas industries have changed significantly since 1920. Automobiles had just started to replace the horse and buggy, and the oil industry was a relatively new enterprise dominated by the successors of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil. Yet, since then, the federal royalty rate for oil and gas on public lands has remained steady, at a bargain-basement 12.5 percent of the value of what’s extracted.</p>

<p>Unusually hot and dry conditions in parts of the northern hemisphere have been conducive to fires raging from the Mediterranean to – in particular – the Arctic. Climate change, with rising temperatures and shifts in precipitation patterns, is amplifying the risk of wildfires and prolonging the season.</p>
<p>WMO’s Global Atmosphere Watch Programme has released a <a href="http://https://youtu.be/ZfJsedQlio0">short animation</a> which highlights the risks and explains how advances in satellite technology make it possible to detect and monitor fire dangers. Improving forecasting systems is important for predictions and warnings around fire danger and related air pollution hazards.</p>
<p>In addition to the direct threat from burning, wildfires also release harmful pollutants including particulate matter and toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and non-methane organic compounds into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Particles and gases from burning biomass can be carried over long distances, affecting air quality in regions far away.</p>

<p>The indications of a warming world are numerous and hard to miss. Last year was the third-warmest year on record for both the planet and the United States — exceeded only by 2015 and 2016. In June, scientists reported that Antarctica has lost 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 — yielding “enough water to cover Texas to a depth of nearly 13 feet,” <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-antarctica-global-warming-20180613-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Associated Press reported</a>.</p>
<p>The indications of inaction on the subject are also abundant and visible. Last year, <a id="PEBSL000163" title="Donald Trump" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/donald-trump-PEBSL000163-topic.html">Donald Trump</a> pulled the United States out of the Paris agreement on greenhouse gas emissions. The <a id="ORGOV000048" title="U.S. Environmental Protection Agency" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/environmental-issues/u.s.-environmental-protection-agency-ORGOV000048-topic.html">Environmental Protection Agency</a> has moved to ease regulations on power plants and motor vehicles that were integral to the Obama administration’s efforts to slow climate change.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Bipartisan action – once a normal response to environmental harms – is not on the agenda for Congress or the White House. But a growing group of farsighted pragmatists are nonetheless trying to find a middle ground between the entrenched adversaries.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People have always said the Donald Trump was smart as a fox. Or that his antics distract from what he really wants, and that he ALways gets what he wants. It has even been said that he is like a major league hitter who whiffs sometimes but hits out of the park enough to have a great average. I think he is just a dumb ass with a lot of money to cover up his mistakes. This is such a doozy that ain&#8217;t no mount of money gonna make up for it. Even the conservatives agree.</p>

<p>The Corner The one and only. ‘Taking Us to the Cleaners’</p>
<p>by Veronique de Rugy January 24, 2018 1:36 PM</p>
<p>The title of this post comes from the great Don Boudreaux, professor of economics and a free-trade warrior, over at Cafe Hayek.</p>
<p>It is the perfect soundbite to the Trump administration’s decision to impose a penalty on Americans who buy foreign-made solar panels and washers. The administration, of course, doesn’t call it that. Instead, it calls it a 30 percent tariff of solar panels and imported washers to protect our domestic manufactures.</p>
<p>Here is what the the solar protection looks like: &#8221; The solar trade protection — which applies to solar panels as well as cells, the piece of equipment that converts sunlight into electricity — is a 30% tariff in the first year, declining to 15% by a fourth year. The first 2.5 gigawatts of cells imported annually is exempt from the tariff.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a perfect example of the profound deficiencies in the process that leads to applying a tariff, which I wrote about last week. The Wall Street Journal reports: &#8220;The solar tariff is a response to a petition filed at the International Trade Commission by two U.S.-based manufacturers — Chinese-owned Suniva, which filed for bankruptcy last year, and German-owned SolarWorld Americas, whose parent company filed for bankruptcy last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alongside Highway 401 in northern North Carolina is a 21st-century twist on a classic rural scene. A few miles outside of Roxboro, sheep graze among <a href="http://www.researchtriangle.org/news-and-events/person-county-solar-park-expansion-nears-completion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5,000 panels</a> at the Person County Solar Park, keeping the grass tidy on the rural installation.</p>
<p>Fields like these aren&#8217;t just scenic settings for roadtripping tourists to snap photos. <a href="http://www.ecowatch.com/tag/solar">Solar</a> has &#8220;been some of the only economic development to happen in rural North Carolina in the last 30 years,&#8221; explained Richard Harkrader, CEO of a local solar company.</p>
<p>For companies like Harkrader&#8217;s Carolina Solar Energy, the Tar Heel State is a great place to do business. Abundant sunshine, <a href="http://www.cleanenergyconservatives.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017_FINAL_CCE-Poll-Press-Release_03.14.17_PDF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ample support</a> for clean energy and smart public policy have spurred the rapid growth of solar. Today, North Carolina boasts more solar capacity than <a href="http://www.seia.org/research-resources/top-10-solar-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">every state</a> except California. In the first quarter of 2017, North Carolina added more solar than any other state, and its solar industry <a href="http://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/north-carolina" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">employs</a> more people than <a href="http://about.wfu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wake Forest University</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me be clear here, the transition to clean energy sources will be painful because it is unplanned. Consider this: What if the Federal Government had a plan to move away from fossil fuels with clear benchmarks for the shift and training programs to move workers into that market. Well, plants would be closed on a schedule that everyone knows in advance, and there would be no pain. Only growth and prosperity. The way we are going about it now, Nuclear Power gets classified as &#8220;green&#8221;, plants are shuttered and workers are thrown out of their jobs. Brilliant.</p>

<h1 class="article-headline">Two Ohio coal-fired plants to close, deepening industry decline</h1>
<div id="article-byline"><span class="author">By <a href="http://www.reuters.com/journalists/emily-flitter">Emily Flitter</a></span> <span class="location"><span class="divider">|</span> NEW YORK</span></div>
<p>Electricity company Dayton Power &amp; Light said on Monday it would shut down two coal-fired power plants in southern Ohio next year for economic reasons, a setback for the ailing coal industry but a victory for environmental activists.</p>
<p>Republican President Donald Trump promised in his election campaign to restore U.S. coal jobs that he said had been destroyed by environmental regulations put into effect by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Dayton Power &amp; Light, a subsidiary of The AES Corporation, said in an emailed statement that it planned to close the J.M. Stuart and Killen plants by June 2018 because they would not be &#8220;economically viable beyond mid-2018.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coal demand has flagged in recent years due to competition from cheap and plentiful natural gas.</p>

So the 2 big questions this raises is 1) Will this have an effect on Chicago&#8217;s electric rates and  renewable goals. and 2) will the WE offer Chicago a new and improved natural gas deal? We shall see. Ameren must be wondering the same sort of things. Below are a short article link and then a longer treatment.</p>

<div id="story-body-text">It was just before Christmas that Gale Klappa, chairman and CEO of Wisconsin Energy Corp., asked Charlie Schrock, his counterpart at Chicago-based Integrys Energy Group Inc., out to dinner.Sitting in a restaurant in Chicago, Klappa didn’t mince words with the head of the parent company for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas.</p>
</div>
<p>“The first thing on my mind that I opened with in my discussion with Charlie is when you look at what the combined company would become in what is clearly a consolidating industry,” he recalled. “Size, scale and the ability to take advantage of the economies of scale is becoming more important.”</p>
<p>On Monday, six months after that dinner, the two CEOS were together again, announcing a $5.7 billion merger agreement that will create an energy company with more than 4.3 million metered electric and gas customers in Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And if you do not believe me, then go to the links below and read what they say.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dangersoffracking.com/">http://www.dangersoffracking.com/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/261337/more-proof-that-fracking-is-dirtier-than-advertised">http://theweek.com/article/index/261337/more-proof-that-fracking-is-dirtier-than-advertised</a></p>
<p>As for what I think:</p>
<p>Hydraulic Fracturing is a drilling process that drills oil and gas wells into shale formations and produces what is referred to as “ tight petroleum fluids”. Principally oil and methane. This process begins by drilling a typical vertical well.  The drill bit is then turned to drill horizontally and moves as far as 3 miles. Then the well is cased with concrete and a slurry of liquids are prepared. We will come back to that discussion in a bit because the fluids pumped into the bore hole are very special. Once the drill is extracted it is replaced with special pipe that is flexible enough to make the turn and has holes in it which are temporarily plugged with ping pong ball  like ball bearings. Once that is done, the fluids  are piped down the well under extremely high pressure. These fluids blast the bearings out of the way and the fluids escape from the pipe and pulverizes the surrounding rock. Then the danger of fracking begins. Because of the  physics of pressure, the fluids  which are now in front of the flow of the oil and methane burst back to the surface and must be contained. After that the dangers only grow. These risks include: Pollution risks, Health risks, Death risks and Financial risks.</p>
<p>The health risks are many. The groundwater risks arise from the fracking itself and the type fluids used. The fluids are extremely toxic.  While I can&#8221;t say what exactly are in the fluids because the drilling companies refuse to release them, everyone admits that toxics like diesel fuel, hydrochloric acid, silica, and antifreeze are involved.  For a list of the thousand of chemical used please see  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_additives_for_hydraulic_fracturing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_additives_for_hydraulic_fracturing</a> .   Will the fluids remain in the area fracked and will the oil and gas flow towards the well head if other avenues are available? This is something no one can guarantee. If even small amounts of the fracking fluids do not return through the bore hole then ground water contamination is possible and well water contamination is all but guaranteed. Surface contamination comes in the form of produced water contamination on the ground and in the nearby waterways. Many wild catters want to just dump those waters in waste pits or worse yet dump them in larger stream and rivers. Even tank storage is problematic. Transportation to a disposal site risks many types of accidents. I believe that all these fluids should be recycled. They contain radioactive materials, heavy metals and poisons like arsenic. Finally there is air pollution. This come in the form of methane and benzene. Many wild catters want to flare the methane and only deal with the oil. This guarantees that methane will be released and methane is one of the most potent green gases around. Exposure to benzene can be lethal as will be discussed later and will lead to lung damage and many cancers.</p>
<p>Some of the health risks were discussed above but there are a set of studies to be considered. You can find these studies easily online but in their gist they ask the question, &#8220;Are children in fracking zones healthy&#8221;?  The answer is NO. In general children that live within a ten mile area of fracked wells have many more health problems than children that live farther away. Please see this list for a discussion of benzene on human health &#8211; <a href="http://www.allenstewart.com/practice-areas/gas-property-damage/chemicals-used-in-fracking/">http://www.allenstewart.com/practice-areas/gas-property-damage/chemicals-used-in-fracking/</a>   If that is true then how healthy can the adults be? But fracking is so new that it is hard to tell. I know in my heart that taking that plunge over that cliff is not worth the danger. We need to stop now.</p>
<p>Then there are risks of death to the nearby humans. Is that extreme? Not in the least. The increase in the large truck traffic alone and the attendant violations of trucking laws will destroy roads and lead to a large increase in traffic accidents leading to increases in deaths. And of course there will be deaths directly relating to the increase in drilling activity. Drilling for oil is inherently dangerous and the industry has its own mortality rate. We have already seen large numbers of deaths due to train wrecks involving trains pulling tanker cars holding fracked oil. Because of the trapped gases in fracked oil it is a lot more explosive. Who wants to die a fiery death? While pipeline leaks could have been discussed anywhere, the problems of pipelining unconventional oil are clear. Since the oil must be heated under pressure to physically move through a pipeline, any leak means the oil cools rapidly and latches on to anything in its path. Especially if it falls into water it will not float and it must be dug out of the bottom. Wherever it lands it begins to release its toxic chemicals including the ever present benzene. While no deaths have yet occurred, fracking possess the possibility of causing major calamities. The first are earthquakes. Today there is no doubt that fracking can cause earthquakes. The questions is when will they cause a major one? So far no earthquake caused by fracking has been greater than a 4.5 earthquake, so we continue to pray they stay small. Then there is the question of Bhopal On The Prairie. This was not a concern of mine but many people who live near old coal mines raised it with me at events I attended. They said, &#8220;What if they frack near an old coal mine or an old uncapped oil well&#8221; both of which Illinois has in abundance? Well the answer is, all the stuff that should go up the nrw well bore hole will spew out into the general environment. If you are anywhere near that the methane will kill you. This is unlikely but just one incident could kill many people.</p>
<p>Ever wonder why oil men refer to their business as a “Boom and Bust” business? It is because of their Financial Risks. These risks are not limited to the investors and the drillers themselves. First and foremost any property owners near these wells will see their property values go to zero and if you hold a mortgage on any such property you will be in debt for a worthless property. There is also a growing push to send the fracked oil and its refined products overseas. This means that oil prices will rise and the cost of gasoline will follow along. But ultimately it is the case that  wildcat fracking is a Ponzi Scheme and that costs investors the most money. Small drillers raise money well by well but when the first one “comes in” they divert some of the profits to the next well which enriches themselves. Because fracked wells have such a short life expectancy (possibly as short as 3 years) eventually the level of those losing money on their investments climb and the driller declares bankruptcy leaving those newest investors holding huge losses. Not only that but it leaves the State of Illinois and individual property owners holding the bag for any damages that remains. This also leads to market manipulation on insider information because the upcoming bankruptcies are an open secret in the oil and gas industry itself.</p>
<p>I must end with a plea for Illinois to stop this. Fracking is nothing but a case of gluttony gone wild. These are not resources we need to exploit now. We could leave these resources for future generations that may need them. But in our general lust for fatter and fatter energy girths we will be looked on by future generations with mortification. Again, shame on everyone in Illinois.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I get this question all the time. The argument is always the trade off argument. We get jobs and cheap fossil fuels but  the environment is degraded. And boy and how. Destroyed is more like it but we do not even get the results that the fracking industry promised. Did I mention it is cold outside?</p>

<h2 style="visibility: visible;">Record high prices for propane, natural gas in some markets as cold snap saps fuel supplies</h2>

<p>NEW YORK — A second fierce blast of winter weather is sapping fuel supplies in many regions and sending prices for propane and natural gas to record highs.</p>
<p>Higher natural gas prices are also leading to sharply higher wholesale electricity prices as power utilities snap up gas at almost any price to run power plants to meet higher-than-normal winter demand.</p>
<p>Propane users will get pinched the most. Those who find themselves suddenly needing to fill their tanks could be paying $100 to $200 more per fill up than a month ago. Homeowners who use natural gas and electricity will see higher heating bills because they&#8217;ll use more fuel. But prices won&#8217;t rise dramatically because utilities only buy a small portion of the fuel at the elevated prices.</p>
<p>A swirling storm with the potential for more than a foot of snow clobbered the mid-Atlantic and the urban Northeast on Tuesday. The snowstorm will be followed by bitter cold as arctic air from Canada streams in, causing homeowners to crank up the thermostat.</p>

<p>NEW YORK — A second fierce blast of winter weather is sapping fuel supplies in many regions and sending prices for propane and natural gas to record highs.</p>
<p>Higher natural gas prices are also leading to sharply higher wholesale electricity prices as power utilities snap up gas at almost any price to run power plants to meet higher-than-normal winter demand.</p>

<p>A swirling storm with the potential for more than a foot of snow clobbered the mid-Atlantic and the urban Northeast on Tuesday. The snowstorm will be followed by bitter cold as arctic air from Canada streams in, causing homeowners to crank up the thermostat.</p>
<p>Michael McCafferty, a propane expert at Platts, an energy information provider, said the wholesale spot price of propane rose 70 percent between Friday and Tuesday to a record $2.45 per gallon. Both the size of the jump and the price itself he called &#8220;unprecedented.&#8221;</p>

<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388764500577_2312">For regulations to work, levied fines must exceed the financial benefit a company gains by violating the rules. None of the rulemaking sanctions meet this criterion. This results in the other 150 pages of rules being essentially meaningless because they will be ignored.   The draft rule sanctions place the Hydraulic Fracturing Regulatory Act (HFRA)  on the road to failure before the first permit is issued.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388764500577_2313"><em>Examples:</em></p>
<ol id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388764500577_2315">
<li id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388764500577_2314">Section 1-100(b) of the law specifies misdemeanor and felony criminal charges for a number of violations of the law.  Yet there are NO criminal charges in the rules</li>
<li id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388764500577_2316">In Section 1-60(a)1-6 of the law, there are six (6) grounds for suspension or revocation of a permit.  These are re-listed with a 7th in section 245.1100 of the rules.  But the very next  section of the Rules&#8211;245.1110&#8211;reduces the grounds for an immediate permit suspension to one: &#8220;an emergency condition posing a significant hazard to the public health, aquatic life, wildlife or the environment.” This is the most stringent requirement of the seven grounds listed in section 245.1100.  Why bother to list seven possible grounds for permit suspension or revocation in section 245.1100 if you then require the Department to identify the most stringent criteria for an immediate suspension.</li>
<li id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388764500577_2317">Section 1-60(b) of the law requires a much lower standard of proof to suspend, revoke or deny a permit than the rules (245.1110).  Under the law, the Department need only serve notice of its action (to suspend, revoke or deny), including a statement of the reasons for the action.</li>
<li id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388764500577_2323">In the law, if a well operator’s permit has been suspended, the burden of proof is on well operator to prove that the identified problem is<strong><em> “no significant threat to public health, aquatic life, wildlife, or the environment&#8221; </em></strong>[Section 1-60(d)].  In the rules, this phrase becomes something <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">IDNR</span></strong> must prove <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before ordering a permit suspension</span> [Rule Section 245.1100(b)3A].</li>
<li id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388764500577_2322">Sections 1-100 and 1-101 of the law have some stiff penalties that accrue on a daily basis until the reason for the fine is corrected.  These fines can go as high as $50,000 per violation and up to $10,000 per day.  These are replaced by fines so trivial ($50-$2500) that it will cost the IDNR more to impose and collect a fine than the dollar value of the fine itself.</li>
</ol>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388764500577_2318"><strong>Revisions Needed:</strong>  Return to the standards of the law with regard to fines, penalties and revocations.</p>
