<p><strong>What is This Device?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s called ÖkoWatt and its tech was originally created by no other than the legendary Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist, Nikola Tesla.</p>
<p>Initially it was concealed from the general public because it offered average families the opportunity to save on their monthly energy costs. <a href="http://track.roinattrack.com/click?cep=2iSzLCQN0QDlUE_kc09NvGhBKa4V9Ds1f1yyex-Z58wWB_8RM5YwHXsOKH9NWUtbuCUSEMRKHQ_0RlDGcUpFlJzGXzi4Q_p74VT-SWA2Q0i-Amg8DFsYirLyDONBCYYGMTX9V7TsDuuIZkSVuIL76ySCYwsuwsEUjTcMDlbbd79ETiuYdHHt5oGNQdr1l1eN7JPAsD9viwI-kdqmdTQvkbPd9bdjXInYoegmhpYVBIUXGEESFgLUY8_CvXOPm9Clow1QlJnEaHOjY_GdeJgzp5p53t2mhHj-vj1kxXzkn49xdzLAV9y76nAZJmRS3uV_nv_UPspIgPLK2NkkliRU4r8uXeozX-1H8ZniVXk_djgY91el84Pbh34N5ozleyRYFKReOdCJ-RDKkHh0ExgHan4LjC9L7uL56NKlOIASPj_sC4R9vbQtBfpCO51NEXXA5XZ8yx2ibfxptiiJ9r4pL9Gas3GK5szYiYN8yVYXopT4LgI9MXdJ2xGppP2wnfHhysBeE3FMbR4NJL1HDz8tfQ&amp;lptoken=154f8257813173a793f7&amp;adversion_id=4238759&amp;ad_id=369037&amp;budget_id=206702&amp;adcampaign_id=150894&amp;publication_id=2853&amp;headline_id=1322572&amp;content_id=279679&amp;previewimage_id=333544&amp;device=desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ÖkoWatt is a small, compact, affordable, and easy-to-use plug-in unit</strong></a><strong> </strong>that stops unnecessary power from entering the electrical cables and overloading the network.</p>
<p>ÖkoWatt is your power company&#8217;s worst nightmare. They have been trying to hide ÖkoWatt from the everyday consumer and have even banned it in retail shops.</p>
<p>Big Energy is threatened by this device and its potential to cut into profits.</p>
<p>However, thanks to the Internet, the secret is out, and everyday people are now reaping the rewards of less power consumption overall, <strong><em>as well as that used by household appliances.</em></strong></p>

<p id="4P0Orz">An <a href="https://www.cbeci.org/">online tool</a> that launched this week called the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, or CBECI, estimates how much energy is needed to maintain the Bitcoin network in real time, before using this to calculate its annual energy usage.</p>

Over the course of a year that’s equal to around 64 TWh or terawatt hours of energy consumption. That’s more than the country of Switzerland uses over the same time period (58 TWh per year), but less than Colombia (68 TWh per year).</p>

<p>A next-generation EPR nuclear reactor in China has carried out its first chain reaction, French energy giant EDF announced Wednesday, becoming the second using the much-delayed European technology to reach the milestone.</p>
<p>The fission reaction at the Taishan 2 reactor on Tuesday follows the Taishan 1 becoming last year the first of its kind to advance to the operational stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;The <a class="textTag" href="https://phys.org/tags/nuclear+reaction/" rel="tag">nuclear reaction</a> was authorised and yesterday the Chinese reactor carried out a <a class="textTag" href="https://phys.org/tags/fission+reaction/" rel="tag">fission reaction</a> for the first time,&#8221; EDF chairman and CEO Jean-Bernard Levy told Europe 1 radio on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Southern Co. will absorb $1.1 billion in additional pre-tax costs for its Plant Vogtle nuclear expansion project, the company said in financial disclosures early today.</p>
<p>The costs include $700 million in additional subcontractor costs and an additional construction contingency estimate for nuclear reactors, which Southern&#8217;s Georgia Power Co. unit is building with a group of public power companies.</p>
<p>Georgia Power recorded the pre-tax charge of $1.1 billion, or $800 million after taxes, for the quarter, ending June 30.</p>
<p>Atlanta-based Southern released the information shortly after 6 a.m. as part of its quarterly report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s decision to eat millions of dollars in costs associated with a large power plant is a bitter reminder to investors of its next-generation coal project in Mississippi. Southern took back-to-back quarterly losses amounting to billions of dollars with the Kemper County energy facility because of a settlement with Mississippi utility regulators.</p>
<p>Unlike Kemper, Southern does not own the technology associated with Vogtle. This is also the first year that the company&#8217;s nuclear unit and Georgia Power are fully in control of the project.</p>
<p>This means the utilities can no longer point fingers at others if there are problems.</p>

<h1>Coal, nuclear plant operator files for bankruptcy, asks Trump for a bailout</h1>
<h2>FirstEnergy&#8217;s request comes after regulator struck down an industry-wide bailout plan.</h2>

<p>On Saturday, power corporation FirstEnergy placed its coal and nuclear generation units <a href="https://cms.arstechnica.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=226681&amp;action=edit">under chapter 11 bankruptcy</a>. Although coal and nuclear plants across the country have struggled to compete with the low prices of natural gas, FirstEnergy&#8217;s filing is unique because it stands to take on a political dimension. Just two days before FirstEnergy&#8217;s bankruptcy filing, the company petitioned the Department of Energy (DOE) for an emergency bailout, <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/firstenergy-asks-doe-for-emergency-action-to-save-pjm-coal-nuke-plants/520280/">citing concerns about reliability</a>.</p>

</aside>
<p>The petition could reinvigorate a debate started by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/energy-secretary-proposes-rule-to-make-grid-managers-favor-coal-nuclear/">proposed a rule</a> last year to change how coal and nuclear plants are compensated for their power. The rule was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/federal-regulator-denies-rick-perrys-proposal-to-compensate-coal-nuclear/">denied by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> (FERC), which said that there was not enough evidence to justify changing how coal and nuclear are compensated.</p>
<p>FirstEnergy disparaged FERC&#8217;s decision in <a href="https://statepowerproject.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/fes-202c-application.pdf">its Thursday petition</a> (PDF), claiming that &#8220;as a result of FERC’s and the RTO&#8217;s [Regional Transmission Organization&#8217;s] failure to address this crisis, swift and decisive action is needed <em>now</em> to address this imminent loss of nuclear and coal-fired baseload generation and the threat to the electric grid that this loss poses&#8221; (emphasis FirstEnergy&#8217;s).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In other words they try to get out of their obligations by appearing to be generous. No Nuke has been built in the U.S. in 40 years because they are financial death traps. It takes a &#8220;modernizing&#8221; economy to support such a massive waste of time and money. And of course ignore safety concerns when regulation is lax. Now they want to give away a partially built plant. What the hell is North Carolina gonna do with that?</p>

<p>COLUMBIA — The parent company of South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co. is offering the site of a failed nuclear reactor project to the state-owned utility Santee Cooper.</p>
<p>SCANA has proposed giving the Fairfield County site to Santee Cooper so the project could be preserved and perhaps finished at some point in the future, The State newspaper reported.</p>
<p>SCE&amp;G and Santee Cooper abandoned their joint effort July 31 after spending more than $9 billion, both blaming the failure on the bankruptcy by principal contractor Westinghouse. SCE&amp;G customers have been charged nearly $2 billion toward interest on the company&#8217;s debt, via a series of rate hikes since 2009, without any power being generated.</p>

<p>TALLAHASSEE — The decision by South Carolina utilities to shut down a nuclear plant under construction should send a signal to other states, including Florida, that a supposed nuclear &#8220;renaissance&#8221; is over, critics said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Florida Power &amp; Light Co. proposed building two new nuclear units at its Turkey Point power plant south of Miami, but the utility told the Public Service Commission in May that it plans to continue a planning &#8220;pause&#8221; while it seeks to learn from nuclear plants that were being built in South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>The decision by SCE&amp;G and Santee Cooper utilities to abandon construction in South Carolina nine years after starting shows that the Florida project is doomed, critics said. Duke Energy Florida in 2013 abandoned its plans to build a new nuclear plant in Levy County.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think for FPL and the people of Florida this is a time to say basically, wait a second what are we doing here?&#8221; said Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I am writing this to avoid writing about the worst piece of Illinois energy legislation in my lifetime. But it is true that this is a great way to save energy and extend the life of your equipment. In addition the site has other useful cleaning tips.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/cleaning/worst-cleaning-jobs-made-easy/cleaning-behind-under-refrigerator">http://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/cleaning/worst-cleaning-jobs-made-easy/cleaning-behind-under-refrigerator</a></p>
<h1 class="lead-headline">The Worst Cleaning Jobs Made Easy</h1>
<h2 class="slide-title">Dirty Job No. 7: Cleaning Behind and Under the Refrigerator</h2>
<p><strong>Time it takes:</strong> 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Lots of dust on the coils can cause a refrigerator to run inefficiently. And dust under the refrigerator can mix with moisture from the air to gum up the finish on your floor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Pull out the refrigerator by grasping both sides and gently wiggling it toward you; some are on wheels, so this may be easier than you think. When you can, reach behind and pull the plug (your food will survive for the short time it takes to clean). If you have an ice maker, shut off the water supply first, just in case the hose comes loose.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To dislodge dust around the condenser coils (the wriggly apparatus in back), use a long, thin tool known as a refrigerator-coil brush (Rubbermaid, $9, <a href="http://www.acehardware.com/product/index.jsp?productId=1279693" target="_blank">acehardware.com</a>), then gently vacuum with a brush attachment. Some refrigerators have their condenser coils behind a removable grille in the front. If yours does, snap off or unscrew the grille and clean the coils, as above.</p>

<p>Go there, read and get clean. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, right off the bat I have to say that this is a for profit business in the waste handling business. The part of their website about recycling is excellent. There business practices may not be. I have never been to Britain and I do not intend to start. Readers will have to judge for themselves. I f they are really bad folks or really good folks let me know.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kenburn.co.uk/recycling-for-kids/">http://www.kenburn.co.uk/recycling-for-kids/</a></p>
<h1>Recycling for Kids</h1>
<p>Did you know that recycling helps save the planet from things like global warming and rubbish? That’s right, by recycling things such as food packets and old toys, you are reducing the amount that gets put into the rubbish bin. This is a very good thing, because rubbish is full of nasty bugs that spread diseases and gases that increase global warming.</p>
<p>But what is recycling? How are things recycled? And what can you do to get more people to recycle?</p>
<p>Read through this leaflet, and by the end of it you will be able to teach your parents a thing or 2 about recycling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is Recycling?</h3>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://www.kenburn.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bin3.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3009" src="http://www.kenburn.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bin3-300x292.jpg" alt="bin3" width="430" height="419" /></a>Fun Fact:</em></strong><em> If we took all of the UK’s rubbish and put it in its biggest lake, it would take 8 months to fill it!</em></p>
<p>Recycling means making rubbish into something new. Every time you throw something away it gets sent to a landfill. More and more rubbish is piled on top until it is too big and the landfill has to be closed.</p>
<p>The great thing is that most things can be recycled. Every day, clever scientists come up with new ways to make use of things we usually consider rubbish. But what exactly do they do with the recycling?</p>

<h1>Blankenship Pleads Not Guilty to Charges Linked to Massey Mine Explosion</h1>
<div class="publish-date">By Jef Feeley and Margaret Cronin Fisk | <span class="the-date">November 21, 2014</span></div>

<p class="bloomberg">Former Massey Energy chief Donald Blankenship pleaded not guilty to charges linked to the West Virginia mine explosion that killed 29 workers in the worst U.S. coal industry disaster in almost 40 years.</p>
<p>The former executive, 64, once a powerful figure in the coal industry and state politics, wore a gray business as he stood with four lawyers in federal court in Beckley, West Virginia, and said, “Not guilty.”</p>
<p>Blankenship is accused of hampering regulators’ safety inspections of the Upper Big Branch mine in Raleigh County where the explosion occurred in April 2010.</p>
<p>The judge set a trial for Jan. 26. About 50 spectators were in the courtroom.</p>
<p>If the former chief executive officer is convicted of the four charges, he faces a maximum penalty of 31 years in prison, according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>Blankenship is accused of setting hyper-aggressive coal- production quotas and instructing subordinates to ignore basic safety measures, such as controlling explosive coal dust and providing proper ventilation in the mines</p>
