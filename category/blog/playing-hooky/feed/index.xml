										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While this article is not click bait per se, the first sentence talks about Roosevelt and WWII. You know, the Big One that he used to take over the economy for almost 10 years. Ask yourself, &#8220;Would any USA President use emergency powers OR The War Powers Act to purge the economy of fossil fuels&#8221;? The real answer is a resounding NO. Then he proceeds to discuss a &#8220;PLAN&#8221; that is more of a &#8220;thought experiment&#8221; or a model with some &#8220;results&#8221;.</p>
<p>None-the-less it is entertaining. And to be fair possible. But somebody has got to light a really really really large fire. Every pun intended.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/21349200/climate-change-fossil-fuels-rewiring-america-electrify">https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/21349200/climate-change-fossil-fuels-rewiring-america-electrify</a></p>

<h1 class="c-page-title">How to drive fossil fuels out of the US economy, quickly</h1>
</div>
<p class="c-entry-summary p-dek">The US has everything it needs to decarbonize by 2035.</p>
<div class="c-byline"><span class="c-byline-wrapper"> By <span class="c-byline__item"> <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/david-roberts" data-analytics-link="author-name"><span class="c-byline__author-name">David Roberts</span></a><a class="c-byline__twitter-handle" href="https://www.twitter.com/drvox">@drvox</a><a title="" href="mailto:david@vox.com">david@vox.com</a> </span> <span class="c-byline__item"> <time class="c-byline__item" datetime="2020-08-06T14:10:00" data-ui="timestamp"> Aug 6, 2020, 10:10am EDT </time> </span> </span></div>
<p id="ZX9Wor">In the runup to World War II, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt enlisted the entire US economy in an effort to scale up production of war material. All of the country’s resources were bent to the task. In 1939, the US had 1,700 aircraft; in 1945, it had 300,000 military aircraft and 18,500 B–24 bombers.</p>
<p id="uRBvdX">By the time the war was won, the economy was up and humming with a massively expanded workforce (drawing in women and African Americans) and turbocharged productive capacity. Investments made during the war mobilization yielded a robust middle class and decades of sustained, broadly shared prosperity.</p>
<p id="SlrMMD">A similar mobilization will be necessary for the US to decarbonize its economy fast enough to avert the worst of climate change. To do its part in limiting global temperature rise to between <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/10/9/17951924/climate-change-global-warming-un-ipcc-report-takeaways">1.5° and 2° Celsius</a>, the US must reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 at the latest. To achieve this, the full resources of the US economy must be bent toward manufacturing the needed clean-energy technology and infrastructure.</p>
<p id="Fyj2J0">FDR began with two questions. First, he asked not what was politically feasible but <em>what was necessary</em> to win the war. He also asked not how much funding was available in the federal budget but how much productive capacity was available in the economy — <em>what was possible</em>.</p>
<p id="ss5u50">Saul Griffith is trying to answer those same questions on climate change: what is necessary, given the trajectory of global warming, and what is possible, given the resources in the US economy.</p>

<p>It is a Vox long read. So go there and read forever. More next week.</p>

<h1>Warren Buffett and casino boss Sheldon Adelson clash in Nevada over electricity</h1>
<p>by Trevor Hunnicutt</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong> | Casino magnate <a href="https://www.afr.com/news/world/north-america/elon-musk-just-gave-almost-us40000-to-republicanallied-group-20180715-h12q03">Sheldon Adelson</a> and investor <a href="https://www.afr.com/personal-finance/why-warren-buffett-likes-apple-20180930-h162k3">Warren Buffett</a> are set for a desert showdown over electricity next week as the two billionaires&#8217; interests collide on election ballots in Nevada.</p>
<p>At issue in the November 6 election is the cost and control of power from the neon lights shining on the Las Vegas Strip to the state&#8217;s gold mines.</p>
<p data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-7770372_137="3869" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time-7770372_137="4000" data-gtm-vis-has-fired-7770372_137="1">A measure supported by Republican donor Adelson, who is also Las Vegas Sands Corp&#8217;s chairman, would force state legislators to break up control over much of the state&#8217;s electricity in effect held by a unit of Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway, NV Energy. It would allow customers to choose their own power provider by 2023.</p>
<p>Buffett has supported liberal causes and backed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p>
<p>Unlike previous western duels, both sides in Nevada are showing up with cash. The energy tussle is shaping up as one of the more costly of an election season in which Democrats are trying to wrest control of at least one chamber of US Congress from Republicans.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and decide for yourself. More next week.:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In other words they try to get out of their obligations by appearing to be generous. No Nuke has been built in the U.S. in 40 years because they are financial death traps. It takes a &#8220;modernizing&#8221; economy to support such a massive waste of time and money. And of course ignore safety concerns when regulation is lax. Now they want to give away a partially built plant. What the hell is North Carolina gonna do with that?</p>

<p>COLUMBIA — The parent company of South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co. is offering the site of a failed nuclear reactor project to the state-owned utility Santee Cooper.</p>
<p>SCANA has proposed giving the Fairfield County site to Santee Cooper so the project could be preserved and perhaps finished at some point in the future, The State newspaper reported.</p>
<p>SCE&amp;G and Santee Cooper abandoned their joint effort July 31 after spending more than $9 billion, both blaming the failure on the bankruptcy by principal contractor Westinghouse. SCE&amp;G customers have been charged nearly $2 billion toward interest on the company&#8217;s debt, via a series of rate hikes since 2009, without any power being generated.</p>

I was so impressed. NASA put her in a building with no &#8220;Blacks Only&#8221; bathroom. So every day she would have to spend a half hour or more getting to the bathroom and back. Yet she got our white male astronauts to and from the moon with no complaints. WOW is all I can say. Please read the book and see the movie.</p>

<p>When NASA’s Langley Research Center built its newest, state-of-the-art research facility in Hampton, Va., it was only right that they named it after Katherine Johnson, the NASA engineer and subject of the book and Oscar-nominated film <em>Hidden Figures.</em></p>
<p>“You want my honest answer? I think they’re crazy,” the 99-year-old math genius said when she heard about the naming of the Katherine G. Johnson Computational Research Facility. The building was <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/langley/nasa-langley-s-katherine-johnson-computational-research-facility-officially-opens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dedicated on Sept. 22 </a>in a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe and students from Black Girls Code and the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program.</p>
<div class="js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic"></div>
<p>The $23 million, 37,000-square-foot data center is named after Johnson, who broke the glass ceiling for black women in the space program. In 2015 Johnson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her work as a trailblazer in the space program.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, right off the bat I have to say that this is a for profit business in the waste handling business. The part of their website about recycling is excellent. There business practices may not be. I have never been to Britain and I do not intend to start. Readers will have to judge for themselves. I f they are really bad folks or really good folks let me know.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kenburn.co.uk/recycling-for-kids/">http://www.kenburn.co.uk/recycling-for-kids/</a></p>
<h1>Recycling for Kids</h1>
<p>Did you know that recycling helps save the planet from things like global warming and rubbish? That’s right, by recycling things such as food packets and old toys, you are reducing the amount that gets put into the rubbish bin. This is a very good thing, because rubbish is full of nasty bugs that spread diseases and gases that increase global warming.</p>
<p>But what is recycling? How are things recycled? And what can you do to get more people to recycle?</p>
<p>Read through this leaflet, and by the end of it you will be able to teach your parents a thing or 2 about recycling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is Recycling?</h3>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://www.kenburn.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bin3.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3009" src="http://www.kenburn.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bin3-300x292.jpg" alt="bin3" width="430" height="419" /></a>Fun Fact:</em></strong><em> If we took all of the UK’s rubbish and put it in its biggest lake, it would take 8 months to fill it!</em></p>
<p>Recycling means making rubbish into something new. Every time you throw something away it gets sent to a landfill. More and more rubbish is piled on top until it is too big and the landfill has to be closed.</p>
<p>The great thing is that most things can be recycled. Every day, clever scientists come up with new ways to make use of things we usually consider rubbish. But what exactly do they do with the recycling?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why is Elon Musk worshiped so? He blows a rocket landing and everyone says it &#8220;Was nicely played&#8221;. In the passed week or so, his companies have both launched a space capsule about a mile in the air and brought it back to the ground my parachute. This was done 50 years ago by NASA. And announce a new battery for the residential housing market which is anything but new. He is a carny shill if ever I saw one. I shall continue this rant over at <a href="https://myspace.com/dougnicodemus">myspace/dougnicodemus</a>  if anyone is interested.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-tesla-s-battery-for-homes-change-the-energy-market/">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-tesla-s-battery-for-homes-change-the-energy-market/</a></p>
<h1 class="article-title">Will Tesla&#8217;s Battery for Homes Change the Energy Market?</h1>
<div class="article-dek">
<p>Tesla did not reveal the price of its larger batteries for businesses and utilities, but it will sell residential models for $3,000—$3,500</p>
</div>
<p>May 4, 2015 <span class="metaDataDivider">|</span>By <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/author/davide-castelvecchi">Davide Castelvecchi</a> and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/author/nature-magazine">Nature magazine</a> <span class="metaDataDivider">|</span> <a class="viewInAnotherLanguage" href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/espanol/noticias/cambiara-el-mercado-de-la-energia-la-nueva-bateria-de-tesla-para-el-hogar/">Véalo en español</a></p>
<p>Tesla Motors, the electric-car maker based in Palo Alto, California, has announced that it will sell versions of its battery packs directly to consumers to help to power their homes, as well as to businesses that run larger facilities, and utility companies.</p>
<p>At a press conference in Los Angeles on April 30, the company’s charismatic founder Elon Musk said that the firm’s lithium-ion batteries would enable economies to move to low-carbon energy sources. Solar energy sources are erratic—but by storing their energy and then releasing it when required, batteries could solve that problem, he said.</p>
<p>Many other companies also sell stationary battery storage for buildings and for power grids—but analysts say that the technology is still too expensive for widespread use. Here, <em>Nature</em> explores whether Tesla’s announcement might change the game.</p>

<h1 id="articleTitle" class="entry-title">Kitchen</h1>
<p class="date-info"><span class="updated">August 5, 2012</span></p>
<div>
<p>There are a variety of ways to improve the energy efficiency of your kitchen, starting with the way you use your appliances to home sealing and replacing your light fixtures.</p>
<div>
<div>
<h2>Floor Vents/Radiators</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ensure vent connections and registers are well sealed at floors, walls and ceilings, which are all common areas for disconnected ducts and leakage.</li>
<li>Make sure all floor vents and air registers are clear of furniture, allowing air to flow freely.</li>
<li>Install heat resistant reflectors between radiators and walls to reflect heat back into the room instead of onto walls.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Range</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the right sized pots with stove burners; for example, a 6? pot on an 8? burner wastes over 40% of the heat generated.</li>
<li>Cover pots and pans when cooking to keep heat in.</li>
<li>Learn more:
<ul>
<li>Save up to $36 annually on electric ranges or $18 on gas by simply using the right sized pots on burners.</li>
<li>Cook more efficiently and keep your kitchen cooler by covering pots and pans.</li>
<li>Keep gas range burners clean to ensure maximum efficiency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Range Hood</h2>
<ul>
<li>Install ENERGY STAR certified range hoods to control moisture and remove cooking odors.</li>
<li>Learn more:
<ul>
<li>On average, ENERGY STAR certified ventilation fans use 60% less energy than standard models.</li>
<li>Save more than $60 in electricity costs over the life of a fan by replacing it with an ENERGY STAR certified one.</li>
<li>By using high performance motors and improved blade design, ENERGY STAR certified fans are quieter, perform better and are longer lasting than standard models.</li>
<li>Look for ENERGY STAR certified range hoods at home improvement and hardware stores, or ask for them from your HVAC or electrical contractor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<div id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388158609481_14725" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;">&#8220;The Hearing Officer shall set a time and place for hearing and shall give notice as follows, at least 20 days prior to the date of the hearing;</div>

<div id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388158609481_14729" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;">The second notice of public hearings&#8211;for Effingham, Decatur, and Carbondale&#8211;was published in the Illinois Register on December 6, 2013.  But the Effingham hearing took place on December 16, 2013, the Decatur hearing took place on December 17, 2013, and the Carbondale hearing took place on December 19, 2013.  Each of those hearings was held on less than 20 days&#8217; notice.</div>

<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1387550914435_5842">Subsection 245.270(n), allows the applicant to attempt to correct deficiencies identified at the hearing, but places no time limit on such correction.  It also doesn&#8217;t require the Department to provide public notice of such correction. As such, applicants could, in principle, provide information to the Department on Day 59 of the 60-day permit issuance period, and the public would not find out about it until long after the permit had been issued.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1387550914435_5843"><strong>Revisions Needed</strong>: This provision should specify a time window for applicants to provide corrections. It should also provide that the post- hearing public comment period must remain open for a sufficient number of days after that time window in order to provide the public adequate time to meaningfully review and comment on those corrections. It would not be unreasonable for deficiencies to be viewed as an incomplete application requiring that the 60-day clock start over.</p>

<li id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1386859456573_13994">In the “Section” dropdown box, click: Section 245.850  Hydraulic Fracturing Fluid and Hydraulic Fracturing Flowback Storage, Disposal or Recycling, Transportation and Reporting Requirements</li>

</ul>
<div id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1386859456573_13997" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;">Section 1-75 of the Hydraulic Fracturing Regulator Act mandates that “excess hydraulic fracturing flowback captured for temporary storage in a reserve pit as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection must be removed from the well site within 7 days.”</div>
<div id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1386859456573_13995" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;">But Section 245.850 of the proposed rules states, “Any excess hydraulic fracturing flowback captured for temporary storage in a reserve pit as provided in Section 245.825 must be removed from the well site or transferred to storage in above-ground tanks for later disposal or recycling within 7 days after completion of high volume horizontal hydraulic fracturing operations.”</div>
<div id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1386859456573_13996" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Problem:</span>  The amendment of “after completion of high volume horizontal hydraulic fracturing operations” opens the door for the potential abuse of emergency pits.  Storage in closed tanks can be costly for the industry.  An unscrupulous operator wanting to cut costs could simply claim that there was more flowback than expected and end up using open pits for storage for the duration of the fracking process.</div>
<div id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1386859456573_14004" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;">The clear intent of the statute is to ensure that wastewater is stored in tanks except in the emergency event of an unforeseeable overflow, in which case it is preferable that the overflow go to a pit than simply spill on the ground. But in such event, the overflow is expressly required in the statute to be removed within a week. Through omission and misinterpretation, the regulations are not implementing this statutory directive.</div>
<div id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1386859456573_14005" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;">Section 245.210(a)(11), requires that an applicant submit a Hydraulic Fracturing Fluids and Flowback Plan.  The plan does not include requirements to ensure that tank capacity is accurately calculated. Without such method, there is nothing in the regulations to prevent operators from underestimating the size of the tanks they need, so as to make routine use of the reserve pit for the resulting overflows. Operators presumably have an economic incentive to do so in order to hold down the cost of tank storage.</div>
<div id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1386859456573_14006" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;">Compounding this incentive is the Department’s weakening of the statutory directive that fluids deposited in a reserve pit be removed within 7 days (Section 1-75(c)(5). The regulations fail to require such prompt removal, allowing, at subsection 245.850(c), the overflow to remain in the reserve pits until 7 days “after completion of high volume horizontal hydraulic fracturing operations.” Certainly on a multi-well pad, hydraulic fracturing operations can continue for a month or more, meaning that the flowback fluid could be left sitting in the reserve pit, creating environmental risk, for much longer than a week.</div>
<div id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1386859456573_14007" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Revisions needed:</span>  First, require that drillers anticipate appropriate sized tanks for sufficient storage of flowback and produced water by establishing a method for tank capacity calculation. Second, clarify that wastewater must be removed from the pit within 7 days of the event that triggered the use of the pit rather than 7 days after fracking operations are complete, in accordance with the law.</div>
<div id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1386859456573_14009" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;"></div>
