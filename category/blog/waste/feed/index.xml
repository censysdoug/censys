										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is an article from 8 years ago. Imagine how much worse it has gotten since then. They have no shame. Who will stop this? Not the Central Government. Not the Provencial Government and not the local for surel. This is what we call in the United States call, a National Sacrifice zone. Remove the people and keep on going. Its disgusting and it&#8217;s despicable. Big YUCK for everyone to see.</p>

<p>Health hazard &#8230; pipes coming from a rare-earth smelting plant spew into a tailings dam on the outskirts of Baotou in China&#8217;s Inner Mongolia autonomous region. Photograph: David Gray/Reuters</p>
<p>From the air it looks like a huge lake, fed by many tributaries, but on the ground it turns out to be a murky expanse of water, in which no fish or algae can survive. The shore is coated with a black crust, so thick you can walk on it. Into this huge, 10 sq km tailings pond nearby factories discharge water loaded with chemicals used to process the 17 most sought after minerals in the world, collectively known as <a class="u-underline" title="" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/27/rare-minerals-global-renewables-industry" data-link-name="in body link">rare earths</a>.</p>
<p>The town of <a class="u-underline" title="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baotou" data-link-name="in body link">Baotou</a>, in Inner Mongolia, is the largest Chinese source of these strategic elements, essential to advanced technology, from smartphones to GPS receivers, but also to wind farms and, above all, electric cars. The minerals are mined at Bayan Obo, 120km farther north, then brought to Baotou for processing.</p>
<p>The concentration of rare earths in the ore is very low, so they must be separated and purified, using hydro-metallurgical techniques and acid baths. <a class="u-underline" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">China</a> accounts for 97% of global output of these precious substances, with two-thirds produced in Baotou.</p>
<p>The foul waters of the tailings pond contain all sorts of toxic chemicals, but also radioactive elements such as thorium which, if ingested, cause cancers of the pancreas and lungs, and leukaemia. “Before the factories were built, there were just fields here as far as the eye can see. In the place of this radioactive sludge, there were watermelons, aubergines and tomatoes,” says Li Guirong with a sigh.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I say the same thing I have said about recycling all along. Store what you can&#8217;t recycle right now and recycle what you can now. The best examples is the large Wind Generator Blades (it used to be common batteries). Throwing stuff in the land fill that has no business there messes everything else up. So storing the Blades from the Wind Generators (turbines whatever) in one place&#8230;even if you bury them is critical, so that when you find a way to recycle them (and you will) you can go get them. Throwing common batteries in a land fill ( AAs, AAAs, etc) is essentially admitting you will never get them back. Better to store them in abandoned warehouses or something. Even burying them in a battery land fill so you can get them back is better than just throwing them away.</p>

<p>Solar panels are an increasingly important source of renewable power that will play an essential role in fighting climate change. They are also complex pieces of technology that become big, bulky sheets of electronic waste at the end of their lives—and right now, most of the world doesn’t have a plan for dealing with that.</p>
<p>But we’ll need to develop one soon, because the solar e-waste glut is coming. By 2050, the <a class="external-link" href="https://www.irena.org/documentdownloads/publications/irena_ieapvps_end-of-life_solar_pv_panels_2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.irena.org/documentdownloads/publications/irena_ieapvps_end-of-life_solar_pv_panels_2016.pdf&quot;}">International Renewable Energy Agency</a> projects that up to 78 million metric tons of solar panels will have reached the end of their life, and that the world will be generating about 6 million metric tons of new solar e-waste annually. While the latter number is a small fraction of the <a class="external-link" href="http://ewastemonitor.info/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;http://ewastemonitor.info/&quot;}">total e-waste humanity produces</a> each year, standard electronics recycling methods don’t cut it for solar panels. Recovering the most valuable materials from one, including silver and silicon, requires bespoke recycling solutions. And if we fail to develop those solutions along with policies that support their widespread adoption, we already know what will happen.</p>
<p>“If we don’t mandate recycling, many of the modules will go to landfill,” said Arizona State University solar researcher Meng Tao, who recently authored a <a class="external-link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pip.3316" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pip.3316&quot;}">review paper</a> on recycling silicon solar panels, which comprise <a class="external-link" href="https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/ise/de/documents/publications/studies/Photovoltaics-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/ise/de/documents/publications/studies/Photovoltaics-Report.pdf&quot;}">95 percent</a> of the solar market.</p>
<p>Solar panels are composed of photovoltaic (PV) cells that convert sunlight to electricity. When these panels enter landfills, valuable resources go to waste. And because solar panels contain toxic materials like lead that <a class="external-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342671383_Metal_dissolution_from_end-of-life_solar_photovoltaics_in_real_landfill_leachate_versus_synthetic_solutions_One-year_study" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342671383_Metal_dissolution_from_end-of-life_solar_photovoltaics_in_real_landfill_leachate_versus_synthetic_solutions_One-year_study&quot;}">can leach out</a> as they break down, landfilling also creates new environmental hazards.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and read. Demand that your municipality pass a law that solar panels do not go in the land fill. More next week.</p>

<p>In 2013, an 18-month-old boy got sick after playing near a hollow tree in his backyard in a remote West African village. He developed a fever and started vomiting. His stool turned black. Two days later, he died.</p>
<p>Two years and more than 11,000 deaths later, the World Health Organization put out a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/01/15/377517132/14-takeaways-from-the-14-part-who-report-on-ebola">report</a> saying the Ebola outbreak that likely emanated from that hollow tree may have been caused in part by deforestation led by &#8220;foreign mining and timber operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tree the boy played near was infested with insectivorous bats — bats that may have been pushed into the boy&#8217;s village because upward of 80% of their natural habitat had been destroyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you disturb a forest, it actually upsets, if you want, the balance of nature, the balance between pathogens and people,&#8221; says John E. Fa, a professor of biodiversity and human development at Manchester Metropolitan University, who was part of a team of researchers that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14727-9">linked recent forest loss to 25 Ebola outbreaks</a> that have occurred since 1976.</p>
<p>A finding, he says, that showed a strong correlation between recent deforestation and disease outbreaks.</p>

<p>As governments around the globe debate how to respond both to the coronavirus itself and the economic chaos it has unleashed, a theme that’s come up over and over is how to prioritize what makes it into spending packages. In the United States, right-left fault lines have emerged over the question of bailing out emissions-heavy industries versus <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/156903/golden-opportunity-green-stimulus">a greener stimulus</a>. On Thursday, the Environmental Protection Agency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/climate/epa-coronavirus-pollution-rules.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">announced</a> a large-scale rollback of environmental regulations as a response to the pandemic—allowing many emitters to police themselves when it comes to pollution.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615338/coronavirus-emissions-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">some argue</a> that the oxygen in the climate debate should be taken up by the pandemic instead, the two issues aren’t mutually exclusive, experts say. In a warming climate, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/155746/climate-change-already-hurting-kids-health">more diseases are likely to emerge and spread</a>, making climate change action an important part of addressing future health crises. Moreover, the perception that climate change isn’t as urgent as other crises may rely on misunderstandings about how climate-related changes will happen. The rate isn’t constant: Instead, there’s reason to believe everything from Arctic melt to Amazon deforestation might experience what’s known as “tipping points,” where small changes in nature shift into rapid and irreversible damage.</p>
<p>Greenland and Antarctica are melting six times faster than they were in the 1990s, according to a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/greenland-antarctica-melting-six-times-faster-than-in-the-1990s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">new study</a> in the journal <i>Nature.</i> Between 1992 and 2017, Greenland and Antarctica lost 6.4 trillion tons of ice. This falls under the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/chapter/summary-for-policymakers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">worst-case scenario</a> projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the effects are already being felt in many parts of the world. The IPCC predicts that by the end of the century, 400 million people around the globe could be at risk of coastal flooding every year from sea-level rise alone.</p>

<p><strong>What is This Device?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s called ÖkoWatt and its tech was originally created by no other than the legendary Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist, Nikola Tesla.</p>
<p>Initially it was concealed from the general public because it offered average families the opportunity to save on their monthly energy costs. <a href="http://track.roinattrack.com/click?cep=2iSzLCQN0QDlUE_kc09NvGhBKa4V9Ds1f1yyex-Z58wWB_8RM5YwHXsOKH9NWUtbuCUSEMRKHQ_0RlDGcUpFlJzGXzi4Q_p74VT-SWA2Q0i-Amg8DFsYirLyDONBCYYGMTX9V7TsDuuIZkSVuIL76ySCYwsuwsEUjTcMDlbbd79ETiuYdHHt5oGNQdr1l1eN7JPAsD9viwI-kdqmdTQvkbPd9bdjXInYoegmhpYVBIUXGEESFgLUY8_CvXOPm9Clow1QlJnEaHOjY_GdeJgzp5p53t2mhHj-vj1kxXzkn49xdzLAV9y76nAZJmRS3uV_nv_UPspIgPLK2NkkliRU4r8uXeozX-1H8ZniVXk_djgY91el84Pbh34N5ozleyRYFKReOdCJ-RDKkHh0ExgHan4LjC9L7uL56NKlOIASPj_sC4R9vbQtBfpCO51NEXXA5XZ8yx2ibfxptiiJ9r4pL9Gas3GK5szYiYN8yVYXopT4LgI9MXdJ2xGppP2wnfHhysBeE3FMbR4NJL1HDz8tfQ&amp;lptoken=154f8257813173a793f7&amp;adversion_id=4238759&amp;ad_id=369037&amp;budget_id=206702&amp;adcampaign_id=150894&amp;publication_id=2853&amp;headline_id=1322572&amp;content_id=279679&amp;previewimage_id=333544&amp;device=desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ÖkoWatt is a small, compact, affordable, and easy-to-use plug-in unit</strong></a><strong> </strong>that stops unnecessary power from entering the electrical cables and overloading the network.</p>
<p>ÖkoWatt is your power company&#8217;s worst nightmare. They have been trying to hide ÖkoWatt from the everyday consumer and have even banned it in retail shops.</p>
<p>Big Energy is threatened by this device and its potential to cut into profits.</p>
<p>However, thanks to the Internet, the secret is out, and everyday people are now reaping the rewards of less power consumption overall, <strong><em>as well as that used by household appliances.</em></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I should very quickly say &#8211; the way things are done now. The mining industry, as it functions in the past and now, destroys things no matter what it is extracting &#8211; gold, lead or lithium. So if we are going to have a real revolution we are going to have to change the entire extraction industry. This point is larger for me than this article implies because capitalism is the problem. We as a society can achieve a carbon negative atmosphere and humans will still threaten the planet because that it what capitalism does &#8211; destroys thing. Still you have to start somewhere.</p>

<p>Deep in the salt flats of Chile lies the extractive frontier of the renewable energy transition.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="article-content mb-5">
<p>Clean energy advocates envision an electrified home running on 100 percent renewable energy with a Tesla parked in its garage, solar shingles gleaming on its rooftop, and a smart meter dutifully collecting usage data and uploading it to the cloud. But swim upstream and eventually you arrive at the extractive frontiers of the renewable energy transition.</p>
<p>It was 8:45 am on the first day of the 11th Lithium Supply &amp; Markets Conference in the basement level of the W Hotel in Santiago, Chile. There was no way for me to blend in. “Providence College” on my name tag rendered me a curiosity. Still, I was glad I remembered to wear lipstick and that my backpack had straps that converted it into a tote.</p>
<p>I found an empty seat in the sea of suits, almost all men but of different ages. They hailed variously from China, Australia, Chile, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Argentina. They were market analysts and prospectors; equipment salesmen and regulators; executives, consultants, and peddlers of information in the notoriously opaque world of lithium, a “space,” in Silicon Valley talk, not quite meriting the word “market.”</p>
<p>As I slid into my seat, the chairman of one of the largest lithium companies in the world, with a sordid past in a corrupt privatization process under Augusto Pinochet’s brutal dictatorship, took to the stage. “Mining is the spine of Chile; mining runs through our veins.” I might have been the only person in the room who immediately thought of Eduardo Galeano’s anti-colonial page-turner, <i>Open Veins of Latin America</i>?—?incidentally penned the same year Pinochet came to power, brutally crushing the dream of democratic socialism in Chile. But I don’t think the chairman meant to call to mind the vampiric iconography of global capital. The dead sapping the living; the blood and sweat and tortured landscapes of extraction, especially in its colonial variant.</p>

This is the guy who got Trump to be &#8220;Pro Coal&#8221; and roll back environmental regulations that have poison our air. Now people&#8217;s pensions are threatened. It doesn&#8217;t get nastier than this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a travesty on so many levels. First at the corporate level, who ran this company into the ground? I mean seriously there are all kind of remedies for years, including burying power lines, and cladding power lines or leasing solar on customers roofs. To not do anything but take profit for thirty years should get someone jail time. Second, what about the employees? The Camp Fire was cause my a Power Pole that was ONE HUNDRED years old. Why did someone not take the damn thing down on their own initiative? Again &#8211; Jail Time. Where were the regulators? That should have made them create a revitalization and safety plans 30 years ago. Again &#8211; Jail Time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I chose to post about something more radical. INFRASTRUCTURE. The idea behind &#8220;keep it in the ground&#8221; is so subversive. That&#8217;s what the XL Pipeline was all about and why the itt was so hotly contested. If you can&#8217;t bring fossil fuels to the market; What good are they? Well, New York tried to do it through legislation, and things got hot right away.</p>

<p>Last September, I <a href="https://www.globalenergyinstitute.org/start-spreading-news-new-york-126">wrote</a> about one of the boldest efforts yet by New York to halt energy infrastructure in its tracks.  This effort utilized a little-known provision of the Clean Air Act – the “good neighbor” provision at Section 126(b) – to argue that hundreds of energy-related and manufacturing facilities located across nine “upwind” states should be subject to additional, costly controls and limitations in order to assist New York in meeting its air quality obligations under 2008 and 2015 national ozone air quality standards.  Last week, the Federal Register <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2019-05-20/pdf/2019-09928.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published</a> the proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to reject New York’s far-reaching petition, providing momentary relief to the thousands of workers across nine states that found themselves within the crosshairs of New York’s “keep it in the ground” ideology.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>With this week’s EPA action, the comment period is now officially open for the public to weigh-in on whether it supports – or opposes – New York’s attempt to curtail or shut down legitimate business activities across Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia.  If you live in any one of these states, and particularly if you live near or work at any of the many <a href="https://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/air_pdf/sips126petition.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facilities targeted</a> (pages 33-42) by New York’s petition, now is the time for you to speak up.</p>
<p>Take a good look at the map below to see the locations of the many facilities targeted by New York’s petition.  Not surprisingly, power plants and refineries are major targets, but so are countless other facility types.  From a Pennsylvania facility that produces renewable energy from municipal waste to steel plants in Michigan to a box factory in rural Virginia, New York’s petition contorts the Clean Air Act well beyond the intended “major source or group of stationary sources” which are typically the subject of a state petition under Section 126.  Even a facility in western Indiana at Purdue University – which is more than 400 miles away from New York’s westernmost border – is targeted as a “bad neighbor” by New York’s complaint.</p>

<p>Go there and read. More next week.</p>
