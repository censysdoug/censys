				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>When I, Cathy and others started CES, my feeling  was that since I was going to be working from home I should spend part of that day improving the house. I figured after the rate hike fight in 2007 that I wanted no part of but got sucked into anyway, that it would take 2 years, maybe 3 to get CES up and running. So Cathy and I sat down and talked about what we wanted to do with the house. She wanted:</p>
<p>a Cistern</p>
<p>a Solar Space on the South side of the house</p>
<p>a solar water heater</p>
<p>I wanted:</p>
<p>a refurbished attic</p>
<p>to  tear out the ceiling in the bedroom</p>
<p>We both agreed that the basement was the place to start. We were getting a little water in the basement when it rained really hard. We knew that we needed to do something about that. We have a nice sump hole and a sump pump, but our thoughts were that maybe we just needed a bigger sump pump. There also was a question of electricity reliability. In three years we had at least 2 long outages&#8230;one lasting 8 days. Of course it usually rained real hard during those periods so we would end up draining our sump hole by hand. (Yes that is right Doug and Cathy with five gallon buckets. We dumped them in the downstairs toilet) We both agreed that the color had to change first. That was the hardest task actually because the entire floor was a hideous green.</p>
<p><a href="http://img301.imageshack.us/img301/1897/oldaomiprototypeyq7.jpg">http://img301.imageshack.us/img301/1897/oldaomiprototypeyq7.jpg </a></p>
<p>So I moved all of the furniture down to one end of the basement and painted the basement steps a nice light blue/gray. Then I painted half of the main floor the same nice blue gray. I moved all of the furniture to the other end of room and painted the rest of the floor a nice blue gray. When I was done I said, What color do you want to paint the plant room honey and she said, LipStick Red. I was aghast. She said that is the color that plants love.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_z7PFSXqH2Vo/SJm6zvOXC7I/AAAAAAAAELg/CfxvWsJDUpw/s320/Red+Lipstick.JPG">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_z7PFSXqH2Vo/SJm6zvOXC7I/AAAAAAAAELg/CfxvWsJDUpw/s320/Red+Lipstick.JPG </a></p>
<p>Yup that Lipstick Red. The one that women have been using to seduce men (not that men need much seducing) since the time of the Pharohs and before. I was incredulous. So I went to the Menards</p>
<p><a href="http://www.menards.com/">http://www.menards.com/ </a></p>
<p>walked up to the paint counter and said I want to paint my plant room. The guy behind the counter said, oh you want a gallon or two of Lipstick Red. I just about died. I said you better make it 2. So I painted that room red. When it started raining the first day we were kinda worried. We had had the drainage system that runs from our back porch to the street blownout with high pressure water some months earlier, but the next rain had brought just a trickle of water.</p>
<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=menards&amp;sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;rlz=1B3RNFA_enUS268US269&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wl">http://maps.google.com/maps?q=menards&amp;sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;rlz=1B3RNFA_enUS268US269&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wl </a></p>
<p>Which you can kinda see in the picture above. We were getting huge puddles on our back porch and were fairly certain that the water in the basement was from the lack o&#8217; drainage in that area. By the 4th day of rain the sump pump was running night and day.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.freefoto.com/preview/35-18-35?ffid=35-18-35">http://www.freefoto.com/preview/35-18-35?ffid=35-18-35</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.freefoto.com/preview/35-18-35?ffid=35-18-35"></a>by the 8th day of rain Iowa looked like this:</p>
<p><a>http://www.saveborrowspend.co.uk/articles/news/1655-flood-cover-should-be-considered </a></p>
<p>We had serious water running through the kitchen (Cathy&#8217;s craft area) in the basement, our sump pump died and we lost power. This solved all of our problems in short order. We immediately bought half  again as large a sump pump and a generator. Doug dug up the drainage system, found the broken tile and repaired it. The water damaged the flooring in the kitchen so we tore it out and installed nice blue &#8220;foamy&#8221; rubber flooring that Cathy had always wanted. And we removed the old nasty PHILGAS stove so she would have more craft space. There is a rainbow at the end of every storm.</p>

			<p>a carpenter&#8217;s doors are never square and the wiring in an electricians house is always scary. Because you never do at home what you do at work. I never had this problem in New Orleans or when I moved back from Springfield. We owned our house in New Orleans and I put a lot of easy low cost energy improvements there. In Springfield, I had rentersitis and was working for Planned Parenthood, Lowe&#8217;s and the Sara Center and was not focused on energy issues.</p>
<p>When I moved in with Cathy in 2004 you would think I would have thought about maybe doing an energy audit but I was still working for the Sara Center and I was really absorbed by that project. I also assumed that if there were major problems Cathy would have found them by that time. She moved in in 1999 and had actually replaced the furnace with a really efficient one for the time. I guess by the time I got around to helping to start Community Energy Systems in 2007 my mind had been cleared by our fight to save our rather full and large (25 x 12 ft.) shed. That event marked the beginning of not only cursing the previous owner but realizing that there could be real problems with the house. I had never met a roof that I couldn&#8217;t get to stop leaking before I met this shed&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/quillus/118385662/in/set-539999/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/quillus/118385662/in/set-539999/ </a></p>
<p>I tried caulk. I tried Plastic Tarps. The Leak just got worse to the point where something really had to be done. It was rotting away. In the interim Cathy and I had been discussing getting a metal roof for the house. I had reservations mainly because Cathy wanted the metal roof because she want a &#8220;clean water&#8221; cistern system to use in the garden. A conventional roof was about 6,000 $$$ and a metal roof was like 15, 000 $$$. Finally I said to her, look we got to do something about the shed or tear it down which means we are going to have to spend money to hold the line until we get our new roof.</p>
<p>So we tore off the roof and immediately found the problem. There were 3 sets of shingles on the roof. To get ready for the sale to Cathy the previous owners had put a brand new set of shingles over 2 old sets. It was the oldest set that was causing the problem. They were so old that they had become water ABSORBENT! So we had to tear off a perfectly good set of shingles to get at and out of the real problem which had OBVIOUSLY been going on before the sale of the house and the previous owners knew about it. Very nice folks.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twincitiesdailyphoto.com/labels/cottage%20grove.html">www.twincitiesdailyphoto.com/<wbr>labels/cottage%2&#8230;</a></p>
<p>Scroll down to the post 5/30/2009 and you can see a picture of what the roof looked like under the new shingles. It was nasty. The water damage to the roof and the eves was extensive. Eventually however we got all that repaired and we put on a self adhesive roll roofing which cost about 300 $$$ and the cost of a laborer to help me was about 1,200 $$$. We had a lot of scrap lumber from our new and improved bathroom project. So we got off pretty cheaply.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cofair.com/peel_seal.aspx">http://www.cofair.com/peel_seal.aspx</a><br>
But that got me to thinking. What else could be hiding in the house that had similarly been covered up? The answer to that when I found it was huge. After Cathy&#8217;s son moved out of the attic I had torn out the early 1960, very nasty carpet and cut it into strips so Cathy could use it as weed suppressing pathways in her garden.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/100_1816.jpg" title="100_1816.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/100_1816.jpg" alt="100_1816.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The other area of the house that we were having trouble with was in the basement. We had a room mate living there for years who had a dog. She bought a house and moved out so I tore the basement apart and cleaned it up. We had water problems, drainage problems and the whole thing was painted putrid green.</p>
<p>So I shut off the HVAC vents, shut the door to the attic and sealed it. What a mistake that was. More tomorrow.</p>

			<p>After an extended meditation like I just concluded on the Federal Energy Tax Credits (please click 2008 elections, international environmental groups and religion categories for more examples),  I am always at a loss for where to go next. I find it useful to just blow it out! So from Live Science and Yahoo I bring you some of the most implausible energy thoughts ever encountered by man:</p>

<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong> <em>This occasional series looks at powerful ideas — some existing, some futuristic — for fueling and electrifying modern life. </em></p>
<p>The sky might literally be the limit for wind power — rotors spinning miles high could help supply electricity worldwide.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a huge amount of energy available in high-altitude winds,&#8221; said researcher Ken Caldeira at the Carnegie Institution&#8217;s Department of Global Ecology in Stanford, Calif. &#8220;These winds blow much more strongly and steadily than <a href="http://www.livescience.com/common/media/video/player.php?videoRef=LS_080929_ChangeWind">near-surface winds</a>, but you need to go get up miles to get a big advantage. Ideally, you would like to be up near the <a href="http://www.livescience.com/environment/weather_science.html">jet streams</a>, around 30,000 feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>All told, if <a href="http://www.livescience.com/php/multimedia/imagedisplay/img_display.php?s=environment&amp;c=news&amp;l=on&amp;pic=090622-kite-wind-power-02.jpg&amp;cap=Airborne+turbines+like+these+depicted+in+this+illustration+could+generate+electricity+from+strong+high-altitude+winds.+Credit%3A+Ben+Shepard%2C+courtesy+Sky+WindPower&amp;title=">wind turbines</a> miles above the planet were tethered to 10 percent of the world&#8217;s land, there is enough energy in these jet stream winds to meet world demand 100 times over, researchers said.</p>
<p>Jet streams are meandering belts of fast winds at altitudes between 20,000 and 50,000 feet. They shift seasonally, but are otherwise persistent features in the atmosphere. Jet stream winds are generally steadier and 10 times faster than wind near the ground, making them a potentially vast and dependable source of energy.</p>
<p>But how to capture the wind so high?</p>
<p><strong>Kites and tethers</strong></p>
<p>A number of technological schemes have been proposed to harvest energy from these high-altitude winds, including <a href="http://www.livescience.com/environment/080806-pf-kites-big.html">tethered, kite-like wind turbines</a> lofted miles high. Up to 40 megawatts of electricity could be generated by current designs and transmitted to the ground via tether.</p>
<p>Using 28 years of weather data, the researchers developed the first-ever global survey of high-altitude wind energy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found the highest wind power densities over Japan and eastern China, the eastern coast of the United States, southern Australia, and north eastern Africa,&#8221; said researcher Cristina Archer, an atmospheric scientist at California State University in Chico.</p>

<p class="art-abstract">  <span class="prepos">Abstract: </span>The objectives of this study are to combine historical observations and state-of-the-art numerical models (MM5/CALMET system) to map the spatial distribution of wind resources in high resolution, and to help foster a deeper understanding of the wind power potential over southern China (Guangdong). Hourly wind fields were simulated for three entire years (2004-2006). It found that almost 70% of the time, the wind speed along the coast of Guangdong is over 5 m/s, which is deemed a baseline magnitude for typical wind turbines. Spatial plots of the wind speed and power and their variations over Guangdong Province for the three years are also presented.</p>

<dt>Dutch astronaut <strong>Dr Wubbo Ockels</strong> has successfully demonstrated i Netherlands his new energy concept. He has flown a high-flying energy kite, creating kinetic energy from huge radio-controlled highflying kites. He has designed <strong>‘ladder-mills’</strong> to store the kinetic energy and convert it into electricity.</dt>
<dt>Three such ladder-mills provide enough electricity to power one city. The experiment was carried out along the northern coastline of The Netherlands where there’s usually more than enough wind to raise the gigantic kites into.The radio- controlled, high-flying kites can create some 10,5kw electricity each, Dr Ockels told a local radio station.High-altitude kites could be used to generate clean energy at a cost comparable with that of fossil fuel generation , researchers claim.<strong>The “Ladder-Mill” is a chain of controllable wing-like kites attached to a looped cable stretching more than five miles into the sky.</strong>Strong high altitude winds acting on the “kitewings” produce as upward force on one side of the loop and a downward force on the other, causing it to rotate.The slowly turning cable drives a power generator in the Ladder-Mill base station.Although the concept sounds far fetched, its developers at Delft Technical University in the Netherlands hope to build a working model in the next four years.
<p>They claim one Ladder-Mill could generate <strong>100 megawatts</strong> of electricity, compared with only a few megawatts from a conventional wind turbine.</p>
<p><strong>Winds at 30,000ft are 20 times more powerful than at sea level</strong>.</p>
<p>Professor Ockels, an ex-astronaut and head of the European Space Agency’s education office, told The Engineer magazine: “Above a certain altitude there is a massive amount of wind power.</p>

Humans have applied the kite to bring perceived benefits during peace and war alike. New applications for the kite continue to be found. Only some innovative applications appear in national patents; others are communicated in newspapers, magazines, books, and internet pages. Air kites, water kites, bi-media kites, fluid kites, gas kites, kytoons, paravanes, soil kites, solid kites, and plasma kites have niche applications that are furthering the interests of humans. Non-human-made kites have applications; some spiders make use of kiting.</p>

<p>I used to say that the quickest way to green was WHITE. Simply painting your roof white with a durable white paint and backing that with a radiant barrier could cut cooling cost in the summer. People would say, &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to block heat in the winter.&#8221; Yah BUT that is a different issue. I always ask people to stay on topic because energy consumption is a complex issue and we must save energy where ever we can when ever we can.</p>

<p>Some people believe that nuclear power is the answer to climate change, others have proposed green technologies such as wind or solar power, but Barack Obama&#8217;s top man on global warming has suggested something far simpler &#8212; painting your roof white.</p>
<p>Steven Chu, the US Secretary of Energy and a Nobel prize-winning scientist, said yesterday that making roofs and pavements white or light-coloured would help to reduce global warming by both conserving energy and reflecting sunlight back into space. It would, he said, be the equivalent of taking all the cars in the world off the road for 11 years.</p>
<p>Speaking in London prior to a meeting of some of the world&#8217;s best minds on how to combat climate change, Dr Chu said the simple act of painting roofs white could have a dramatic impact on the amount of energy used to keep buildings comfortable, as well as directly offsetting global warming by increasing the reflectivity of the Earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that building is air-conditioned, it&#8217;s going to be a lot cooler, it can use 10 or 15 per cent less electricity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You also do something in that you change the albedo of the Earth &#8212; you make it more reflective. So the sunlight comes down and it actually goes back up – there is no greenhouse effect,&#8221; Dr Chu said.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Why backed by a radiant barrier? Because light is made up of different lengths of waves. Loosely stated there are  short wave lengths of light and long wave lengths of light. The short wave lengths bounce off the white but the long wave lengths keep on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWxJOht2yRE">trucking.</a></p>

<h1>Appreciate Your Home with Quality Metal Roofing</h1>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been considering upgrading your home and increasing its resale value, you should know that beautiful and enduring metal roofing is highly valued as one of the top renovation-friendly building materials for rehabbers and new home builders alike.</p>

<p>As reported by Sal Alfano of <em>Remodeling Magazine</em>, homes renovated with standing-seam metal roofing show a rate of 85.9% cost recouped in the national average with up to 95.5% for homes in the Eastern states, a full 1 and 6% resale value gain over homes roofed with asphalt. And with all the added safety and longevity associated with quality metal roofing matching installation job costs that reach only one half of that of cosmetic room remodeling averages or even <em>one eighth</em> of that of a master suite addition, you hardly deny the sense in upgrading.</p>

<p><!--innerMod--> &#8220;3M innovation led to the development of the 3M Cool Roofing Granules,&#8221; said 3M division vice president Greg Linnerooth. &#8220;The color palette is up to three times more reflective than comparable typical colored granules. The benefit of more highly reflective granules is the potential energy savings for homeowners, while providing a wide variety of beautiful shingle color blends they have come to expect. Homeowners now have a colorful alternative to white-only shingles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elk Cool Color Series is the result of joint development program with 3M, the world&#8217;s leading manufacturer of roofing granules. The effort has produced a reflective asphalt shingle with all of the natural beauty of Elk&#8217;s color palette. The energy efficient shingles are the first offered in earthy hues, lighter versions of popular Elk colors: Cool Weatheredwood, Cool Antique Slate and Cool Barkwood. Prestique Cool Color Series shingles carry a 40-year limited warranty and up to a 90 mph limited wind warranty with special application technique(a).</p>
<p>Elk also offers Domain(R) Winslow(R) in its Cool Color Series, a large-scale, wood-shake look shingle available in the Cool Browncastle shade and boasts a 50-year limited warranty and up to a 110 mph limited wind warranty with special application technique(a) (Special application technique is required.

			<p>Would you buy a Soda Pop and poor part of it down the drain? Well why would anybody buy energy and cast it into the open air? It is dumb but hundreds of millions of Americans do it every year. There are some experts who argue that we can&#8217;t make our appliances or buildings with too much insulation or too &#8220;tight&#8221; because we have got to breathe. I am not one of those.

<p>Many people want to start the discussion there however and I have learned to stop that, by simply saying, &#8220;how much insulation do you have in your house&#8221;, because no one has enough. At any rate here is what you can get from the Feds;</p>
<p>(while I am thinking about it you can get rebates at the State and local level. I may discuss some of that but geeze there are 50 states and probably 7,000 counties in the US. Most of that info you WILL have to check on your own)</p>

<p>It is pretty straight forward:</p>
<p></p>
<center>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p></p>
</center>
<strong>Why Insulate Your House?</strong>Heating and cooling account for 50 to 70%  of the energy used in the average  American home.   Inadequate insulation and air leakage are leading causes of energy  waste in most homes.  Insulation:
<ul>
<li>saves money and our nation&#8217;s limited energy resources</li>
<li>makes your house more comfortable by helping to maintain a uniform temperature throughout the house, and</li>
<li>makes walls, ceilings,   and floors warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The amount of energy you conserve will depend on several factors: your local climate; the   size, shape, and construction of your house; the living habits of your family; the type and   efficiency of the heating and cooling systems; and the fuel you use.  Once  the energy savings   have paid for the installation cost, energy conserved is money saved &#8211; and saving energy will   be even more important as utility rates go up.</p>
<p>This fact sheet will help you to understand how insulation works, what different types of   insulation are available, and how much insulation makes sense for your climate.  There are many   other things you can do to conserve energy in your home as well.  The Department of Energy   offers many <a href="http://www.ornl.gov/sci/roofs+walls/insulation/ins_07.html"><strong>web sites</strong></a> to help you save energy by   sealing air leaks, selecting more energy-efficient appliances, etc.</p>

<strong>How Insulation Works</strong><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://www.ornl.gov/sci/roofs+walls/insulation/htxfer101.gif" height="170" width="410">
</td>
<td>Heat flows naturally from a warmer to a cooler space. In winter, the heat moves directly   from all heated living spaces to the outdoors and to adjacent unheated attics, garages, and   basements &#8211; wherever there is a difference in temperature. During the summer, heat moves from   outdoors to the house interior. To maintain comfort, the heat lost in winter must be replaced   by your heating system and the heat gained in summer must be removed by your air conditioner.   Insulating <a href="http://www.ornl.gov/sci/roofs+walls/insulation/fig1.html" target="new_window" rel="noopener">ceilings, walls, and floors</a> decreases   the heating or cooling needed by providing an effective resistance to the flow of heat.</td>

<tr valign="top">
<td>Batts, blankets, loose fill, and low-density foams all work by limiting air movement. (These   products may be more familiarly called fiberglass, cellulose, polyicynene, and expanded   polystyrene.) The still air is an effective insulator because it eliminates convection and has   low conduction.  Some foams, such as polyisocyanurate, polyurethane,    and extruded polystyrene, are filled with special gases that provide additional resistance to   heat flow.Reflective insulation works by reducing the amount of energy that travels in the form of   radiation.  Some forms of reflective insulation also divide a space up into small regions to   reduce air movement, or convection, but not to the same extent as batts, blankets, loose-fill, and foam.</td>

<p>:}</p>
<p>But there is a dizzying array of products:</p>
<p>The different forms of insulation can be used together. For example, you can add batt or roll   insulation over loose-fill insulation, or vice-versa. Usually, material of higher density (weight   per unit volume) should not be placed on top of lower density insulation that is easily compressed.   Doing so will reduce the thickness of the material underneath and thereby lower its R-value.   There is one exception to this general rule: When attic temperatures drop below 0?F, some   low-density, fiberglass, loose-fill insulation installations may allow air to circulate between   the top of your ceiling and the attic, decreasing the effectiveness of the insulation. You can   eliminate this air circulation by covering the low-density, loose-fill insulation with a blanket   insulation product or with a higher density loose-fill insulation.</p>

<u>Blankets, in the form of batts or rolls</u>, are flexible products made from mineral fibers,   including fiberglass or rock wool. They are available in widths suited to standard spacings of   wall studs and attic or floor joists. They must be hand-cut and trimmed to fit wherever the joist   spacing is non-standard (such as near windows, doors, or corners), or where there are obstructions   in the walls (such as wires, electrical outlet boxes, or pipes). Batts can be installed by   homeowners or professionals.  They are available with or without vapor-retarder facings. Batts   with a special flame-resistant facing are available in various widths for basement walls where   the insulation will be left exposed.</td>

<u>Foam insulation</u> can be applied by a professional using special equipment to meter, mix, and spray the foam into place. Polyisocyanurate and polyurethane foam insulation can be produced in two forms: open-cell and closed-cell. In general, open-celled foam allows water vapor to move through the material more easily than closed-cell foam. However, open-celled foams usually have a lower R-value for a given thickness compared to closed-cell foams. So, some of the closed-cell foams are able to provide a greater R-value where space is limited.</td>

<u>Rigid insulation</u> is made from fibrous materials or plastic foams and is produced in   board-like forms and molded pipe coverings. These provide full coverage with few heat loss   paths and are often able to provide a greater R-value where space is limited. Such boards may   be faced with a reflective foil that reduces heat flow when next to an air space. Rigid   insulation is often used for foundations and as an insulative wall sheathing.</td>

<u>Reflective</u> insulation systems are fabricated from aluminum foils with a variety of   backings such as kraft paper, plastic film, polyethylene bubbles, or cardboard. The resistance   to heat flow depends on the heat flow direction, and this type of insulation is most effective   in reducing downward heat flow. Reflective systems are typically located between roof rafters,   floor joists, or wall studs. If a single reflective surface is used alone and faces an open space,   such as an attic, it is called a <a href="http://www.ornl.gov/sci/roofs+walls/radiant/index.html" target="new_window" rel="noopener">radiant barrier</a>.<u>Radiant barriers</u> are installed in buildings to   reduce summer heat gain and winter heat loss. In new buildings, you can select foil-faced wood products   for your roof sheathing (installed with the foil facing down into the attic)    or other locations to provide the radiant barrier as an integral part of the    structure.  For existing buildings, the radiant barrier is typically fastened across the bottom of joists,    as shown in this drawing.  All radiant barriers must have a low emittance (0.1 or less) and high reflectance (0.9   or more).</td>

			<p>Conserving Energy Will Bankrupt Our Economy</p>
<p>Energy Efficiency Is Too Expensive For Poor People</p>
<p>Coal Will Always Be a Part Of Our Energy Mix</p>
<p>The Future Is Nuclear Power</p>
<p>And so it goes. I will say it only one time and then repeat it for the rest of my life, YOU WILL Always SAVE Money By Saving Energy. Right now in the worst Depression since the Great Recession people are still throwing their energy $$$ out the window. People are so used to Energy as a Commodity concepts that they talk about turning the thermostats down not Turning Their Insulation up. There is nothing wrong with drying your clothes on a clothesline. How are you going to lose money planting a garden?</p>

<p id="publicationDate">For decades, frugality has been despised as stinginess. But with the recent collapse of consumer culture, it is now in style again. Its return confirms that, given time, everything sensible eventually comes back into fashion—an article of faith to the thrifty, including me.</p>
<p>I was not always frugal. In high school I was as careless a spender as any other suburban American girl. The clothes and music I bought with my after-school earnings didn’t  begin to satisfy my longings, which I regularly laid on my parents as a fatal need for another sweater.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, when I moved to New York for graduate school, I did a complete turnaround. Initially, I was motivated by the desire to spend a year abroad, which in those pre-credit-card days required saving money. But mainly, I think, living on my own for the first time, I felt free to revise my values to suit a serious-minded grad student.</p>
<p>I adopted a set of simple if stringent rules that still make sense today: If you don’t need it, don’t buy it; never buy a new one if your old one works; never buy an expensive one when a lower-priced one will do. I abandoned bookstores for libraries, restaurants for my kitchen, boutiques for bargains—and soon found myself enjoying a gleeful sense of liberation. By limiting my consumption and saving for what I really wanted, I felt empowered. Here was a way to beat the system and achieve control.</p>
<p>But frugality is one thing in a student, another in a woman of the world. As the years passed, I hung onto it, but I also knew better than to broadcast it. It became a secret strength, a guilty pleasure.</p>
<p>My delight in frugality took a giant step when, at age 50, I went one summer to a house on an island off the coast of Maine. It offered propane and rainwater instead of electricity and plumbing, and the island store was an hour’s walk away. Far from lamenting the lack of amenities, I felt stimulated and challenged. With nothing to buy and no one to impress, I set out to discover what mattered most. What I learned is how little one needs to be content and how much of life’s bounty is free if you open your eyes and use your imagination.</p>

<h1>How To Save Smarter</h1>
<p id="kicker">           by Tim Harford</p>
<p id="publicationDate">published: 05/10/2009</p>
<p>Not very long ago, Americans were terrible savers. In 2007, the average person put aside 60 cents of every $100, or .6% per paycheck. However, the current economic downturn has shocked us into depositing more at the bank. As of February, the personal savings rate was more than 4%. That’s  a big improvement, but it’s still half of 1980s levels, when Americans routinely socked away 10% of their paychecks. Why is saving so hard? And how can we be smarter savers?</p>
<p>Behavioral economists—researchers who mix psychology and economics—have uncovered three reasons why people find it so difficult to save. The first is temptation: Although we often later regret it, we just can’t resist spending. The second is lack of understanding: Our brains can’t quite grasp the profitability of saving. The third is optimism: We believe that everything will work out, even if we don’t save.</p>
<p>Fortunately, researchers have found solutions to these problems. Temptation can be countered if you make saving as much fun as spending. This isn’t such a stretch. Neuroeconomist Ben Seymour of University College, London, sits in front of a brain scanner and watches what happens in our heads when we think about financial decisions. He found that imagining a future purchase is almost as good as getting it. For example, when we daydream about buying a new car, our brains respond in much the same way as when we actually make the purchase.</p>
<p>We can harness this buzz to our benefit by discarding vague ideas of “saving for a rainy day” and focusing instead on particular items we need or want. “Saving is much easier when it’s for something specific,” Seymour says. Reinforce this connection in your mind by opening a different savings account devoted to each of your goals: one for a new car, one for a vacation, one for a child’s college tuition fees.</p>

</span></strong><span class="style95">by Bruce Mulliken, Green Energy News</span></span></p>
<p class="style20">Author, activist, statesman, inventor Benjamin Franklin famously said, “A penny saved is a penny earned.” Kilowatts weren’t yet conceived in his day but the experimenter in electricity certainly would have quipped, “Kilowatts saved are pennies earned.”</p>
<p class="style20">Somehow I think the man who believed in frugality would have been a vocal proponent of energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="style20">Today, saving energy and using it more efficiently is not just virtuous, it’s good business. In an economy struggling to get traction, spending less on energy can mean the difference between business failure and staying in it. A penny spent on energy savings can shift a negative number on the balance sheet into the positive column.</p>
<p class="style20">For an individual a switch to a more fuel efficient car or truck will make an immediate and noticeable difference in cash outflows. But adding more efficient lighting or beefing up insulation in a home will be barely noticeable on the monthly utility bill. (Rest assured; the savings will be there and evident in the long run.)</p>
<p class="style20">However, for a business, energy efficiency measures of all kinds will stand out when the bill comes due. When dozens, hundreds or thousands of light fixtures are changed to more efficient ones the effect on the bottom line will be immediate. Further, calculating the dollars and cents difference between the efficiency investment and long term energy savings can give a business a long term bill of health.</p>

<p>Washington, DC, April 2009 – Although gasoline prices are heading upward once again, they are nowhere near last summer&#8217;s average high of $4.11 a gallon, meaning that you could drive more for less. But is that smart? As a matter of fact, one of the bright spots in this turbulent economy is that it will actually cost significantly less to power your home and vehicles this year than last year.</p>
<p>With &#8220;frugality&#8221; being the hot buzzword in this tough economy, why pay more for energy than you have to? The Alliance to Save Energy offers extensive money-saving resources and tips to reduce your energy bills so you and your family have more money for other things:</p>

<a href="mailto:clusvardi@herald-review.com">clusvardi@herald-review.com</a></span></p>
<p><span class="bodytext">DECATUR — A project to test carbon dioxide storage capacity deep below Archer Daniels Midland Co.’s campus is scheduled to begin this spring.</span></p>
<p>The company will announce today a partnership with the Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium, which is led by the Champaign-based Illinois State Geological Survey, to work on the $84.3-million project.</p>
<p>It will be one of seven projects the U.S. Department of Energy is funding to demonstrate carbon dioxide, or CO2, storage capacity in underground formations throughout the country. Researchers are looking for uses of carbon dioxide other than emitting it into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>“The whole idea is to understand what is going on in any given area to figure out whether this technique can be safe and effective,” said Robert Finley, director of the Illinois State Geological Survey. “Ultimately this is a technique that we are looking at very carefully to understand what the volume of the CO2 is that might actually be placed in the subsurface.”</p>
<p><span class="bodytext">The consortium will receive $66.7 million to test a part of the Mount Simon Sandstone, a saline-water-bearing rock formation that has increased in notoriety recently because the FutureGen plant in Mattoon also will test it. The formation runs below most of Illinois, Kentucky and Indiana and part of Ohio.</span></p>
<p>Beginning in late April, workers will drill more than 6,500 feet below the surface to the rock layer where the carbon dioxide will be stored. The drilling is expected to take about two months to complete, Finley said.</p>
<p>The energy department has awarded $4.2 million in funding for the drilling, Finley said. Another $5.24 million to cover the first year of the project is expected to be awarded within weeks, he said.</p>
<p>The project will inject 1,000 tons per day of carbon dioxide from ADM’s ethanol plant into the ground, Finley said. The layer where it will be injected is about 1,000 feet thick in the Decatur area, Finley said.</p>
<p>Injecting is scheduled to start in October 2009 and be completed in 2012. For two years after that, officials will monitor, take samples and make sure nothing is leaking from the formation.</p>

<p>OK let us see &#8211; How can something be CERTAIN and yet Experimental? No one will answer that question. The Illinois EPA which is being investigated by the Federal EPA for Collusion with Polluters gave them a permit in a heartbeat..:</p>

<p><strong><em>One Million Metric Tons of Carbon to be Sequesteres at Illinois Site</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>(Washington, D.C.)</strong> &#8211; Drilling nears completion for the first large-scale carbon dioxide (CO2) injection well in the United States for CO2 sequestration. This project will be used to demonstrate that CO2 emitted from industrial sources &#8211; such as coal-fired power plants &#8211; can be stored in deep geologic formations to mitigate large quantities of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) hosted an event April 6 for a CO2 injection test at their Decatur, Ill. ethanol facility. The injection well is being drilled into the Mount Simon Sandstone to a depth more than a mile beneath the surface. This is the first drilling into the sandstone geology since oil and gas exploratory drilling was conducted between 15 and 40 years ago. No wells within 50 miles have been drilled all the way to the bottom of the sandstone, which the storage well will do.</p>
<p>The project is funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity.</p>
<p>“This test represents an exciting step forward in the Department’s collaborative efforts to develop America’s carbon sequestration capabilities,” said Dr. Victor K. Der, Acting Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy. “In Decatur, we’re moving from theory to application.”</p>
<p>A collaboration between ADM and the Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium (MGSC), the injection test is part of the development phase of the Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships program managed by the National Energy Laboratory (NETL) for the Department of Energy’s Office of Fossil Energy (FE).</p>
<p>The project will obtain core samples of the Mount Simon Sandstone during drilling that will be used in analysis to help determine the best section for injection. The sandstone formation is approximately 2,000 feet thick in the test area.</p>
<p>From 2010 to 2013, up to one million metric tons of captured CO2 from ADM’s ethanol production facility in Decatur will be injected more than a mile beneath the surface into a deep saline formation. The amount of injected CO2 will roughly equal the annual emissions of 220,000 automobiles.</p>

<p>What was it that Sarte said about Collaboraters, &#8220;shave the women&#8217;s heads and shoot the men&#8221;. There will be accidents and deaths from this process. THERE ALWAYS ARE in any industrial process. The worst case is explosions and deaths followed by contaminated ground water. If eventually successful, what else will they try to put down there? This is short term planning for short term gain (the hallmark of Corporate Capitolism) at its finest.</p>
<p>You might ask &#8211; at what cost?</p>

<p>The Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium (MGSC), lead by the Illinois State Geological Survey, Archer Daniels Midland Company, Schlumberger Carbon Services, and the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE) marked a milestone in one of the nation’s first large-scale studies intended to confirm that carbon dioxide emissions can be stored permanently in deep underground rock formations. At a ceremonial groundbreaking celebrating the imminent completion of an approximately 8,000-foot-deep injection well on ADM’s Decatur, Ill., property, officials noted the significance of the DOE funded Illinois Basin-Decatur study.</p>

<p>ComEd parent Exelon Corp. plans to build the nation&#8217;s largest urban solar power plant on the city&#8217;s South Side by year&#8217;s end.</p>
<p><!-- BlogBurst ContentEnd -->  <!-- start sidebar --></p>
<p class="sidebar">The $60 million project is expected to create about 200 temporary construction jobs and 10 to 15 permanent positions at the plant. The project is contingent upon Exelon getting a federal loan guarantee for up to 80 percent of its cost under the federal stimulus package that is doling out money for green jobs and emissions reductions.</p>

<p><!-- BlogBurst ContentStart -->The planned 10-megawatt solar photovoltaic building would be at an industrial site near 120th and Peoria in the West Pullman neighborhood, Chicago-headquartered Exelon said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The plant&#8217;s 32,800 solar panels would convert the sun&#8217;s rays into enough electricity to meet the annual energy requirements of 1,200 to 1,500 homes. It would eliminate about 31.2 million pounds of greenhouse gas emissions a year, the equivalent of taking more than 2,500 cars off the road or planting more than 3,200 acres of forest, Exelon said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is exactly the type of shovel-ready, community-benefitting project that the Obama administration is touting,&#8221; said Thomas O&#8217;Neill, senior vice president for new business development at the company&#8217;s Exelon Generation.</p>

<h1 class="p5h">Madigan: Electric dereg law may need overhaul</h1>
<h2 class="p5h">Overhaul might protect consumers, House speaker says</h2>

<p>The 1997 law that restructured Illinois’ electric industry has failed to live up to its promise, and it may be time to consider an overhaul to protect consumers from volatile power prices, says House Speaker Michael Madigan.</p>
<p>Madigan, a Chicago Democrat, has filed a legislative resolution calling on the Illinois Power Agency to study whether to let utility companies regain the authority to run their own power-generating plants.</p>
<p>Such a move would reverse a key part of the 1997 law often referred to as “electric deregulation.” Under that law, utility companies such as Ameren Illinois and Commonwealth Edison stopped generating electricity and became power-delivery companies only. The companies’ power-generating arms were spun off into separate, unregulated entities.</p>
<p>The thinking at the time was that consumers would benefit because they’d be able to shop for power as they shop for other goods and services, looking for the best deal and saving money. But competition never developed in the residential market, and residential customers have seen their bills increase.</p>

<p><span class="firstletter">I</span>t was April Fool&#8217;s Day, 1979—30 years ago this month—when Randall Thompson first set foot inside the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant near Middletown, Pa. Just four days earlier, in the early morning hours of March 28, a relatively minor problem in the plant&#8217;s Unit 2 reactor sparked a series of mishaps that led to the meltdown of almost half the uranium fuel and uncontrolled releases of radiation into the air and surrounding Susquehanna River.It was the single worst disaster ever to befall the U.S. nuclear power industry, and Thompson was hired as a health physics technician to go inside the plant and find out how dangerous the situation was. He spent 28 days monitoring radiation releases.</p>
<p>Today, his story about what he witnessed at Three Mile Island is being brought to the public in detail for the first time; and his version of what happened during that time, supported by a growing body of other scientific evidence, contradicts the official U.S. government story that the Three Mile Island accident posed no threat to the public.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened at TMI was a whole lot worse than what has been reported,&#8221; Thompson told <em>Facing South</em>. &#8220;Hundreds of times worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>All of these articles gooooooooooo on and on about the radioactive iodine that was released being huge, that the total amount of released material was larger yet (nobody mentions it but a lot of it went into the river) and that approximately 450 people died. So I am just going to stitch some articles together. You can read the whole thing if you want:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.commondreams.org/view/2009/04/03-9">http://www.commondreams.org/view/2009/04/03-9 </a></p>
<p>That it happened on April Fools day means that there is a god.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p><strong>Anomalies abound</strong></p>
<p>That a lot of people died because of what happened at Three Mile Island, as the Thompsons claim, is definitely not part of the official story. In fact, the commercial nuclear power industry and the government insist that despite the meltdown of almost half of the uranium fuel at TMI, there were only minimal releases of radiation to the environment that harmed no one.</p>
<p>For example, the Nuclear Energy Institute, the lobbying group for the U.S. nuclear industry, <a href="http://www.nei.org/resourcesandstats/publicationsandmedia/insight/insight-web-extra/three-mile-island-30-years-later/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declares</a> on its website that there have been &#8220;no public health or safety consequences from the TMI-2 accident.&#8221; The government&#8217;s position is the same, reflected in <a href="http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/3mile-isle.html" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fact sheet</a> distributed today by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the federal agency charged with overseeing the U.S. nuclear power industry: TMI, it says, &#8220;led to no deaths or injuries to plant workers or members of the nearby community.&#8221; [The watchdog group Three Mile Island Alert offers their take on the NRC factsheet <a href="http://www.tmia.com/node/164" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.]</p>
<p>Those upbeat claims are based on <a href="http://www.threemileisland.org/downloads/188.pdf" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the findings of the Kemeny Commission</a>, a panel assembled by President Jimmy Carter in April 1979 to investigate the TMI disaster. Using release figures presented by Metropolitan Edison and the NRC, the commission calculated that in the month following the disaster there were releases of up to 13 million curies of so-called &#8220;noble gases&#8221; &#8212; considered relatively harmless &#8212; but only 13 to 17 curies of iodine-131, a radioactive form of the element that <a href="http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/iodine/physiologic_effects.html" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at even moderate exposures causes thyroid cancer</a>. (A curie is a measure of radioactivity, with 1 curie equal to the activity of one gram of radium. For help understanding these and other terms, see the glossary at the end of this piece.)</p>
<p>But the official story that there were no health impacts from the disaster doesn&#8217;t jibe with the experiences of people living near TMI. On the contrary, their stories suggest that area residents actually suffered exposure to levels of radiation high enough to cause acute effects &#8212; far more than the industry and the government has acknowledged.</p>
<p>Some of their disturbing experiences were collected in the book <em>Three Mile Island: The People&#8217;s Testament</em>, which is based on <a href="http://www.greenaction-japan.org/internal/090217_tmi_testament.pdf" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviews</a> with 250 area residents done between 1979 and 1988 by Katagiri Mitsuru and Aileen M. Smith.</p>
<p>It includes the story of Jean Trimmer, a farmer who lived in Lisburn, Pa. about 10 miles west of TMI. On the evening of March 30, 1979, Trimmer stepped outside on her front porch to fetch her cat when she was hit with a blast of heat and rain. Soon after, her skin became red and itchy as if badly sunburned, a condition known as erythema. About three weeks later, her hair turned white and began falling out. Not long after, she reported, her left kidney &#8220;just dried up and disappeared&#8221; &#8212; an occurrence so strange that her case was presented to a symposium of doctors at the nearby Hershey Medical Center. All of those symptoms are <a href="http://www.bt.cdc.gov/radiation/arsphysicianfactsheet.asp" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistent with high-dose radiation exposure</a>.</p>

<p>But this has been going on for years&#8230;please ignore the nutball survivalist website. It is difficult to get Ken Briggs testimony online. Don&#8217;t forget we had Jimmie &#8220;the nuke&#8221; Carter as President&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>

However, government officials recognize that in a       catastrophic incident, a 20 mile evacuation radius akin to what was needed with the       Chernobyl disaster may be more appropriate.} </em></font></strong>The Pennsylvania Emergency       Management Agency recommended Friday morning that 10-mile plans be       readied. The three counties closest to the nuclear plant already had plans       to evacuate their residents &#8212; a total of about 25,000 living within 5       miles of the Island. A 10-mile evacuation had never been contemplated. For       Kevin Molloy in Dauphin County, extending the evacuation zone meant the       involvement of several hospitals &#8212; something he had not confronted       earlier. There were no hospitals within 5 miles. <strong>Late Friday night,       PEMA told county officials to develop 20-mile plans.</strong> Suddenly, six       counties were involved in planning for the evacuation of 650,000 people,       13 hospitals, and a prison.&#8221;</font></font></p>

<p>I quote this to say what should have happened immediately. Not 1 day later when the State was notified and not 3 days later when the Feds had been notified. By that time they knew that a good chunk of New York and Pennsylvania were involved so they DID NOTHING.</p>
<p>The damage was done pretty much in the first several hours of the crisis. There is this from 1979 and it is nasty:</p>

<strong>Deaths after Three Mile Island accident (end of March 1979):</strong></p>
<p><strong>US Center for Health Statistics for Pennsylvania in May 1979.  A SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>US Center for Health Statistics for Pennsylvania in May 1979 showed the following (per thousand live births): 147 infant deaths in February, 141 in March, 166 in April, 198 in May. At the same time the number of births had declined from 13,589 in March 1979 to 13,201 in May. For the United States as whole the rate of infant deaths per 1000 live births had declined 11 percent between March and May 1979…., “the Pennsylvania figures for March and May representing an increase of 57 deaths, which was more than three times the statistically expected normal fluctuation of about +/- 16, and thus unlikely to occur purely by chance in less than one in a thousand instances.”</p>
<p><strong>The US Vital Statistics for Upstate New York in 1979.  A SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>The US Vital Statistics for Upstate New York in 1979 (north, northwest, and northeast of Harrisburg some 100 to 200 miles away and in the direction the wind was blowing when the heaviest releases of radiation were occurring.) According to these studies of wind direction the expectation was that “The figures for the rest of the state outside of New York City should have gone up, while New York City should either have shown no change or an actual decline….the numbers showed: Between March and May, infant deaths outside New York City climbed an amazing 52 percent, by 63 deaths, from 121 to 184. For New York City during the same period the number declined from 166 to 129. Again, these changes were many times as large as normal fluctuations, and the number of births changed relatively little, or by less than 10 percent.</p>
<p><strong>What about the data for Harrisburg? A SUMMARY.</strong></p>
<p>“only Tokuhata had the data for the 5-mile and 10-mile zones around the plant, and there was no way that I would be able to obtain them…Warren L. Prelesnik, executive vice-president in charge of administration Harrisburg Hospital provided a list of the monthly infant deaths, fetal deaths, stillbirths, and live births in the Harrisburg Hospital for the previous two years. In February, March, and April of 1979, there had only been 1 infant death per month. But for each of the two months of May and June, there were 4. Effectively, since the number of births had not only remained nearly the same but had actually declined slightly, this was more than a fourfold increase in the mortality rate, or of the right magnitude required to fit the observed 50 percent rise in the more distant area of upstate New York. From an average of 5.7 per 1000 live births in the three months of February, March, and April &#8212; before the releases could have had an appreciable effect &#8212; the newborn mortality rate had risen to 24.1 for May and 26.0 for June, an unprecedented summer peak that did not occur the previous year. In fact, for May and June of 1978, there had been a total of only 3 infant deaths, while for the same period in 1979 after the accident, there had been 8.As some of my colleagues with whom I discussed these findings agreed, by themselves the Harrisburg Hospital numbers were of course small, and only marginally significant, representing only about one-third of all the births and deaths in Harrisburg. But taken together with the vastly more significant and independent numbers for all of Pennsylvania, upstate New York, New York City, New Jersey, Maryland, and Ohio, there was now a much greater degree of certainty: It would have been much too much of a coincidence &#8212; perhaps less than one in a million &#8212; for all these different numbers to show the pattern they did.</p>
<p><strong>The time and cause of death due to radiation.  What can be expected.  SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>One of the remaining important questions that had to be checked, however, was the time and cause of death? if the excess deaths were connected with the radioactive iodine released from the plant, then they should be associated with underweight births or immaturity, since damage to the fetal thyroid would slow down the normal rapid growth and development of the baby in the last few months before birth. The development of the lungs, which have to be ready to begin breathing at the moment of birth, is one of the most critical phases of late fetal development. Any developmental slowdown would be most life-threatening if it led to the inability of the tiny air sacs in the lungs to inflate and start supplying the blood with oxygen. Failure of the lungs to function properly would therefore lead to immediate symptoms of respiratory distress, and if efforts to treat the baby should not succeed, it would die in a matter of minutes, hours, or days of respiratory insufficiency or hyaline membrane disease. Thus, one would not expect to find as large an increase in spontaneous miscarriages well before birth as newborn deaths within a short time after birth, since the lungs did not need to start functioning until the baby was born. Also, there should be no significant increase in gross congenital malformations a few months after the accident, since by the time the baby in the mother&#8217;s womb had reached the sixth or seventh month of development, all the major organs had already fully developed. Thus, only some six to seven months after the accident would one expect some increase in serious physical malformations, since these infants would have been exposed to radiation in the first three months of development of critical-organ formation.</p>
<p><strong>data from the Harrisburg Hospital supported these expectations</strong></p>
<p>State of Pennsylvania Health Department had discovered a rise in hypothyroidism among newborn babies in areas where the radioactive gases from Three Mile Island had been carried by the winds.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">March 15, 2009 Susan and I are saddened to learn of Alex&#8217;s departure. I valued his leadership as dean and his advice as a colleague. He was a highly active and creative member of our campus community. He was forever launching new initiatives toward the betterment of our campus, our community, and the world. His initiatives strengthened the Environmental Studies Program and contributed to the vitality of the campus. His sense of humor also lightened the tone of sometimes difficult operational discussions. His creativity even extended to the genius of his costumes at our vaunted Halloween parties. He once appeared as the most authentic witch we had ever seen! We want to offer our deepest sympathy to his family.    <strong>Wayne and Susan Penn (Walnut Creek, CA)</strong></p>

I saw him last when he came to Pennsylvania for the funeral of our friend, Ashim Basu.

<p class="MsoNormal">March 14, 2009 This is terrible news! Al was one of a kind. I remember asking my friends in Carbondale, as I was moving to Springfield after graduate school, who to look up in the capitol city. Al was a name that was highly recommended. We became friends and shared an ethnic background and were both scientists and involved in energy and public affairs. I knew of his work on the Springfield Energy Project as I was active with the Carbondale City Energy Division and Shawnee Solar Project. He made a tremendous contribution to not only Sangamon State University (U of IL), but also the city of Springfield. He led by example in his own home energy improvements and was a huge inspiration to not only students but also the community. He was an expert in energy and environmental affairs long before it was fashionable. I could always count on him to conduct a television interview with political speakers I had brought to Springfield. He was a great comrade and I will always remember his funny laugh. My husband was a student at SSU and remembers well Alex&#8217;s messy and very interesting and stimulating office, full of posters, quotes and books. Even his office was an education. My husband&#8217;s and my heart go out to his children, grandchildren and wife. We know the Force is with him now and he is marveling at the wonders of God&#8217;s universe, now revealed in full without human or laboratory constraints. He is now a student in the ultimate Physics class. May God Bless Him and Keep Him. The world has lost a very good man that enriched all who knew him. Godspeed Alex!    <strong>Valeri DeCastris (Rockford, IL)<p></p></strong></p>
