Seriously does the world need a bigger excuse to intervene? Hell, we started a War in Vietnam over shots that WEREN&#8217;T fired. China has taken over countries just because a 1,000 ago they were part of China. But messing with multiple Nuclear Power Plants ain&#8217;t enough? Earth&#8217;s Countries are going to mess around here and have a real disaster on its hands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mitigation efforts always sound sensible to sensible people. There are always people who have a knee jerk, industry involved NO WAY reaction. Just like with cigarettes: doesn&#8217;t cause it -you can&#8217;t prove it, to ok maybe it exists but there is nothing you can do about it, to those methods won&#8217;t work, to if you outlaw it you will put people out of work. But most people (as far as the carbon economy goes) Carbon Taxes, Carbon Trading and Carbon Reduction methods all seem OK. But how can you tell if they work, or in this case DON&#8217;T?</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0">Along the coast of Northern California near the Oregon border, the cool, moist air off the Pacific sustains a strip of temperate rainforests. Soaring redwoods and Douglas firs dominate these thick, wet woodlands, creating a canopy hundreds of feet high.</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">But if you travel inland the mix of trees gradually shifts.</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">Beyond the crest of the Klamath Mountains, you descend into an evergreen medley of sugar pines, incense cedars and still more Douglas firs. As you continue into the Cascade Range, you pass through sparser forests dominated by Ponderosa pines. These tall, slender trees with prickly cones thrive in the hotter, drier conditions on the eastern side of the state.</p>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">All trees consume carbon dioxide, releasing the oxygen and storing the carbon in their trunks, branches and roots. Every ton of carbon sequestered in a living tree is a ton that isn’t contributing to climate change. And that thick coastal forest can easily store twice as much carbon per acre as the trees deeper inland.</p>

His editorial is so wrong in so many ways. Yes, we ARE causing the next big extinction by habitat destruction and this pandemic is a perfect result of that habitat destruction and it&#8217;s results. Global warming IS the biggest crisis facing humans. Its true &#8211; not the biggest crisis facing the Earth cause after we are gone and all the smoke gets reabsorbed the Earth will be just fine. This guy is raising money by spreading feel good skepticism (and that&#8217;s all it is) and making himself famous by telling lies.</p>

<p class="">On behalf of environmentalists everywhere, I would like to formally apologize for the climate scare we created over the last 30 years. Climate change is happening. It’s just not the end of the world. It’s not even our most serious environmental problem.</p>
<p class="">I may seem like a strange person to be saying all of this. I have been a climate activist for 20 years and an environmentalist for 30.</p>
<p class="">But as an energy expert asked by Congress to provide objective expert testimony, and invited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to serve as Expert Reviewer of its next Assessment Report, I feel an obligation to apologize for how badly we environmentalists have misled the public.</p>
<p class="">Here are some facts few people know:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Humans are <em>not</em> causing a “sixth mass extinction”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">The Amazon is <em>not</em> “the lungs of the world”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Climate change is <em>not</em> making natural disasters worse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Fires have <em>declined </em>25% around the world since 2003</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">The amount of land we use for meat — humankind’s biggest use of land — has<em> declined</em> <em>by an area nearly as large as Alaska</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">The build-up of wood fuel and more houses near forests, <em>not</em> climate change, explain why there are more, and more dangerous, fires in Australia and California</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Carbon emissions are declining in most rich nations and have been declining in Britain, Germany, and France since the mid-1970s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Netherlands became rich not poor while adapting to life below sea level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">We produce 25% more food than we need and food surpluses will continue to rise as the world gets hotter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Habitat loss and the direct killing of wild animals are bigger threats to species than climate change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Wood fuel is far worse for people and wildlife than fossil fuels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Preventing future pandemics requires more not less “industrial” agriculture</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0">Partisan fights in Washington can leave the impression that we’re hopelessly divided. The truth is there are plenty of bipartisan solutions to the energy and environmental challenges we face, and energy efficiency is near the top of the list.</p>
<p class="css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0">America fails to capture some two-thirds of the power it generates, much of it through simple waste, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/americans-used-more-clean-energy-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to federal data</a>. In a recent survey, the United States was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://aceee.org/portal/national-policy/international-scorecard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranked eighth</a> among 23 of the world’s top energy-consuming countries in efficiency, behind several European nations, China and Japan.</p>
<p class="css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0">We shouldn’t accept that.</p>
<p class="css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0">Energy efficiency is one of the most powerful resources we have for meeting our energy and environmental goals. It is also an enormous economic opportunity.</p>
<p class="css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0">Setting aside the significant environmental impact, this energy waste costs American businesses and households billions of dollars every year. In commercial buildings alone, where annual electricity costs are roughly $190 billion, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://energy.gov/eere/buildings/about-commercial-buildings-integration-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about 30 percent of this energy</a> goes to waste.</p>

<p>On Saturday, power corporation FirstEnergy placed its coal and nuclear generation units <a href="https://cms.arstechnica.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=226681&amp;action=edit">under chapter 11 bankruptcy</a>. Although coal and nuclear plants across the country have struggled to compete with the low prices of natural gas, FirstEnergy&#8217;s filing is unique because it stands to take on a political dimension. Just two days before FirstEnergy&#8217;s bankruptcy filing, the company petitioned the Department of Energy (DOE) for an emergency bailout, <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/firstenergy-asks-doe-for-emergency-action-to-save-pjm-coal-nuke-plants/520280/">citing concerns about reliability</a>.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p>The petition could reinvigorate a debate started by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/energy-secretary-proposes-rule-to-make-grid-managers-favor-coal-nuclear/">proposed a rule</a> last year to change how coal and nuclear plants are compensated for their power. The rule was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/federal-regulator-denies-rick-perrys-proposal-to-compensate-coal-nuclear/">denied by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> (FERC), which said that there was not enough evidence to justify changing how coal and nuclear are compensated.</p>
<p>FirstEnergy disparaged FERC&#8217;s decision in <a href="https://statepowerproject.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/fes-202c-application.pdf">its Thursday petition</a> (PDF), claiming that &#8220;as a result of FERC’s and the RTO&#8217;s [Regional Transmission Organization&#8217;s] failure to address this crisis, swift and decisive action is needed <em>now</em> to address this imminent loss of nuclear and coal-fired baseload generation and the threat to the electric grid that this loss poses&#8221; (emphasis FirstEnergy&#8217;s).</p>

<p>TALLAHASSEE — The decision by South Carolina utilities to shut down a nuclear plant under construction should send a signal to other states, including Florida, that a supposed nuclear &#8220;renaissance&#8221; is over, critics said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Florida Power &amp; Light Co. proposed building two new nuclear units at its Turkey Point power plant south of Miami, but the utility told the Public Service Commission in May that it plans to continue a planning &#8220;pause&#8221; while it seeks to learn from nuclear plants that were being built in South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>The decision by SCE&amp;G and Santee Cooper utilities to abandon construction in South Carolina nine years after starting shows that the Florida project is doomed, critics said. Duke Energy Florida in 2013 abandoned its plans to build a new nuclear plant in Levy County.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think for FPL and the people of Florida this is a time to say basically, wait a second what are we doing here?&#8221; said Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The news only gets better for renewables. Wind did not keep pace with Solar but wind had a huge head start. Coal is fading in the rear view mirror and natural gas is neck and neck. I think the US is finally catching on, but you can bet the first things Trump will go after will be subsidies and the EPA.</p>

<p>Renewable-energy growth has accelerated in 2016, but this may go down as a milestone year for one renewable-energy <span class="vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default"><span class="vm-hook">source</span></span> in particular.</p>
<p>Together, all renewable-energy sources are expected to account for 8 percent of U.S. electricity-generation capacity in 2017, according to the Department of Energy, and solar energy is responsible for most of that growth.</p>
<p>For the first time ever, new solar-generating capacity is expected to exceed new generating capacity for wind and natural gas.</p>
<p><strong>DON&#8217;T MISS: <a title="We're there! Renewables now cheapest unsubsidized electricity in U.S." href="http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1107993_were-there-renewables-now-cheapest-unsubsidized-electricity-in-u-s">We&#8217;re there! Renewables now cheapest unsubsidized electricity in U.S.</a></strong></p>
<p>The final tally won&#8217;t be available until March, but enough new solar installations were expected to be completed in 2016 <a title="Solar Looks to Outpace Natural Gas and Wind" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/solar-looks-to-outpace-natural-gas-and-wind/" target="_blank">to outpace wind and natural gas</a>, according to <em>Scientific American</em>.</p>
<p>A total of 9.5 gigawatts of solar-generating capacity were expected to be built in 2016, tripling the amount installed in 2015, the magazine said, citing Energy Department data.</p>
<p>That amount would exceed the anticipated 8.0 GW of natural gas capacity, and 6.8 GW of wind capacity.</p>

<p>Workers have installed blades on four of the five 589-foot turbines at the site off the coast of Rhode Island and construction may be complete as early as this week, according to Chief Executive Officer Jeff Grybowski. The 30-megawatt, $300 million project is expected to begin commercial operation in early November.</p>
<p>“We will finish in advance of our original schedule,” Grybowski said in an interview at a dock on Block Island. “And we are in-line with our budget.”</p>

This month, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker signed a bill requiring utilities to buy 1,600 megawatts of electricity from offshore wind farms over the next decade. And in the coming weeks, New York State plans to release a long-range plan to develop wind farms off the coast of Long Island.</p>

<p>Owners of the failed San Onofre nuclear power plant operated the reactor outside the allowable limits for pressure and temperature, causing the radiation leak that shut down the facility for good in 2012, a new report has found.</p>
<p>Citing documents recently obtained from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, former Southern California Edison engineer Vinod Arora issued a report Tuesday laying blame for the breakdown squarely on Edison.</p>
<p>&#8220;Higher primary reactor coolant temperatures and higher steam pressure caused tube-to-tube contact resulting in dangerous and potentially deadly tube ruptures,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Excessive tube wear inside replacement steam generators forced the shutdown in 2012.</p>

<h1>One of Africa’s Biggest Dams Is Falling Apart</h1>
<h3>By <a title="Jacques Leslie" href="http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/jacques-leslie" rel="author">Jacques Leslie</a></h3>
<p class="descender" data-wc="105"><strong>T</strong>he new year has not been kind to the hydroelectric-dam industry. On January 11th, the New York <em>Times</em> reported that Mosul Dam, the largest such structure in Iraq, urgently requires maintenance to prevent its collapse, a disaster that could drown as many as five hundred thousand people downstream and leave a million homeless. Four days earlier, the energy minister of Zambia declared that Kariba Dam, which straddles the border between his country and Zimbabwe, holding back the world’s largest reservoir, was in “dire” condition. An unprecedented drought threatens to shut down the dam’s power production, which supplies nearly half the nation’s electricity.</p>
<p data-wc="111"><strong>T</strong>he news comes as more and more of the biggest hydroelectric-dam projects around the world are being cancelled or postponed. In 2014, researchers at Oxford University reviewed the financial performance of two hundred and forty-five dams and concluded that the “construction costs of large dams are too high to yield a positive return.” Other forms of energy generation—wind, solar, and miniature hydropower units that can be installed inside irrigation canals—are becoming competitive, and they cause far less social and environmental damage. And dams are particularly ill-suited to climate change, which simultaneously requires that they be larger (to accommodate the anticipated floods) and smaller (to be cost-effective during the anticipated droughts).</p>
<div class="content-ad-wrapper first">
<div class="advertisement" data-ismobile="true" data-name="yrailTop" data-sz="320x251" data-kw="topBox"> <strong>M</strong>osul Dam’s predicament is partly a result of the ongoing war; many maintenance workers have not returned there since August of 2014, when <small>ISIS</small> fighters briefly took control. (Iraqi and Kurdish forces soon regained it.) But the main issue is that, like many such dams, the project shouldn’t exist in the first place. Opened in 1986, it was built on unstable gypsum bedrock, requiring grout to be constantly injected into the foundation to prevent the dam’s collapse. That work has ceased. In 2006, long before <small>ISIS</small> began making headlines, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers called Mosul Dam “the most dangerous dam in the world.”</div>
