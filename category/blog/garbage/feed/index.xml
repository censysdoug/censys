<p><strong>What is This Device?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s called ÖkoWatt and its tech was originally created by no other than the legendary Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist, Nikola Tesla.</p>
<p>Initially it was concealed from the general public because it offered average families the opportunity to save on their monthly energy costs. <a href="http://track.roinattrack.com/click?cep=2iSzLCQN0QDlUE_kc09NvGhBKa4V9Ds1f1yyex-Z58wWB_8RM5YwHXsOKH9NWUtbuCUSEMRKHQ_0RlDGcUpFlJzGXzi4Q_p74VT-SWA2Q0i-Amg8DFsYirLyDONBCYYGMTX9V7TsDuuIZkSVuIL76ySCYwsuwsEUjTcMDlbbd79ETiuYdHHt5oGNQdr1l1eN7JPAsD9viwI-kdqmdTQvkbPd9bdjXInYoegmhpYVBIUXGEESFgLUY8_CvXOPm9Clow1QlJnEaHOjY_GdeJgzp5p53t2mhHj-vj1kxXzkn49xdzLAV9y76nAZJmRS3uV_nv_UPspIgPLK2NkkliRU4r8uXeozX-1H8ZniVXk_djgY91el84Pbh34N5ozleyRYFKReOdCJ-RDKkHh0ExgHan4LjC9L7uL56NKlOIASPj_sC4R9vbQtBfpCO51NEXXA5XZ8yx2ibfxptiiJ9r4pL9Gas3GK5szYiYN8yVYXopT4LgI9MXdJ2xGppP2wnfHhysBeE3FMbR4NJL1HDz8tfQ&amp;lptoken=154f8257813173a793f7&amp;adversion_id=4238759&amp;ad_id=369037&amp;budget_id=206702&amp;adcampaign_id=150894&amp;publication_id=2853&amp;headline_id=1322572&amp;content_id=279679&amp;previewimage_id=333544&amp;device=desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ÖkoWatt is a small, compact, affordable, and easy-to-use plug-in unit</strong></a><strong> </strong>that stops unnecessary power from entering the electrical cables and overloading the network.</p>
<p>ÖkoWatt is your power company&#8217;s worst nightmare. They have been trying to hide ÖkoWatt from the everyday consumer and have even banned it in retail shops.</p>
<p>Big Energy is threatened by this device and its potential to cut into profits.</p>
<p>However, thanks to the Internet, the secret is out, and everyday people are now reaping the rewards of less power consumption overall, <strong><em>as well as that used by household appliances.</em></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I agreed to publish this here because it is such a different perspective then the one I have or CES has. We tend to blame builders for not just serving up top notch energy efficient residences. Then there is the issue of retrofitting. As always this is no endorsement of Ryan or his Real Estate firm. Believe me I have no intention of buying a home in Alaska.</p>

More buyers see the value of it, and more builders and sellers are starting to make changes in that direction. There is still a long way to go before energy efficiency and reducing waste becomes the standard for new homes and improved existing homes, but a larger pool of buyers demanding these features can help move the needle bit by bit.</div>

<h1 class="headline"><a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/05/20/stopping-the-great-lakes-radioactive-dump/" rel="bookmark">Stopping the Great Lakes Radioactive Dump</a></h1>
<p class="post_meta"><span class="post_author_intro">by</span> <span class="post_author"><a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/author/john-laforge/" rel="nofollow">John Laforge</a></span></p>
<p>Hundreds of environmental and public interest groups, dozens of governmental bodies and thousands of concerned residents across the Great Lakes Basin have joined in rejecting a proposal by the giant utility company Ontario Power Generation (OPG) to bury 200,000 cubic meters of its radioactive waste on the eastern shore of Lake Huron, near its Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, in Kincardine, Ontario. The proposed dump is for so-called low- and intermediate-level radioactive wastes from the company’s 20 nuclear reactors. The site is 1.2 kilometers from Lake Huron on Bruce Peninsula.</p>
<p>On May 6, Canada’s Joint Review Panel submitted to Canada’s Ministry of Environment — the Honorable Leona Aglukkaq — its formal recommendation to approve the plan. Intervening parties have 120 days to submit comments on the JRP’s “environmental assessment” once its “conditions” have been made public. Aglukkaq will then make a recommendation to Ontario’s Premier, Kathleen Wynne, who will make the final decision about whether the dump should be constructed.</p>
<p>Most of the groups, legislators and cities opposing the so-called Deep Geologic Repository (regular folks call it a hole in the ground) have decided to ignore or to just parody the forthcoming “conditions” regulating the plan. A nit-picking analysis of them, they say, only gives the impression that permanent contamination of the Great Lakes somehow an acceptable risk under certain theoretical, computer-model-derived conditions. As Dr. Gordon Edwards, founder of Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility, said May 19 over the phone, “We reject any permanent abandonment of radioactive waste deep underground near the Great Lakes. And this project, at this time, under any conditions is absurd.”</p>

The 2 most consistently true ones are that there are too many people on this planet and the other is that we will pay a price for befouling our planet. This has led some to talk about the possibility of a human &#8220;die back&#8221;. Is this what the beginning of one might look like?</p>

<h2>China&#8217;s mysterious pig, duck, and people deaths could be connected. And that should worry us.</h2>
</div>
<h3>BY LAURIE GARRETT | APRIL 1, 2013</h3>
</div>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it would happen. Children playing along an urban river bank would spot hundreds of grotesque, bloated pig carcasses bobbing downstream. Hundreds of miles away, angry citizens would protest the rising stench from piles of dead ducks and swans, their rotting bodies collecting by the thousands along river banks. And three unrelated individuals would stagger into three different hospitals, gasping for air. Two would quickly die of severe pneumonia and the third would lay in critical condition in an intensive care unit for many days. Government officials would announce that a previously unknown virus had sickened three people, at least, and killed two of them. And while the world was left to wonder how the pigs, ducks, swans, and people might be connected, the World Health Organization would release deliberately terse statements, offering little insight.</p>
<p>It reads like a movie plot &#8212; I should know, as I was a consultant for Steven Soderbergh&#8217;s <em>Contagion</em>. But the facts delineated are all true, and have transpired over the last six weeks in China. The events could, indeed, be unrelated, and the new virus, a form of influenza denoted as H7N9, may have already run its course, infecting just three people and killing two.</p>
<p>Or this could be how pandemics begin.</p>
<p>On March 10, residents of China&#8217;s powerhouse metropolis, Shanghai, noticed some dead pigs floating among garbage flotsam in the city&#8217;s Huangpu River. The vile carcasses appeared in Shanghai&#8217;s most important tributary of the mighty Yangtze, a 71-mile river that is edged by the Bund, the city&#8217;s main tourist area, and serves as the primary source of drinking water and ferry travel for the 23 million residents of the metropolis and its millions of visitors. The vision of a few dead pigs on the surface of the Huangpu was every bit as jarring for local Chinese as porcine carcasses would be for French strolling the Seine, Londoners along the Thames, or New Yorkers looking from the Brooklyn Bridge down on the East River.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This isa  pretty interesting piece. It implies that most of the complicated and expensive atom level experiments to create nanotubes and other &#8220;nanostructures&#8221; were something of a waste of time. They also imply that the next advance in nanotechnology maybe finding ways to form, market and install new nanostructures at the real world level. In the literature it is stated that this form of cellulose can be both an insulator and a conductor so it would be nice if someone came up with a shielded electrical cable that could be used in the housing market, for instance. I have included 2 references for clarity&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanocellulose">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanocellulose</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.conservationmagazine.org/2012/06/nanocellulose-is-no-small-thing/">http://www.conservationmagazine.org/2012/06/nanocellulose-is-no-small-thing/</a></p>
<h1><a title="Permanent Link to Nanocellulose Is No Small Thing" href="http://www.conservationmagazine.org/2012/06/nanocellulose-is-no-small-thing/" rel="bookmark">Nanocellulose Is No Small Thing</a></h1>
<h2>Trees could become part of electronics, medical devices, and military gear</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For centuries, the forestry industry</strong> has produced paper and lumber. But what if trees could be transformed into an entirely new set of products, ranging from electronic sensors to biomedical implants to military protective gear?</p>
<p>The idea isn’t as improbable as it sounds. Researchers are studying a nanoscale material that can be extracted from trees and, in some forms, is about as strong as Kevlar. Called “nanocellulose,” this lightweight material is composed of bundled sugar chains from the cell walls of wood. Researchers can extract nanocellulose by grinding pulp or using chemicals to break it down into tiny particles. At such small scales, the material has fewer defects, making it stronger. One type of nanocellulose particle, called cellulose nanocrystals, is especially tough because the sugar chains are arranged in a highly ordered structure.</p>
<p>Researchers envision a huge array of applications for nanocellulose. It could partially replace fossil fuel–based products such as petroleum-derived plastics and might be cheaper than other high-performance nanoscale materials. Clear sheets of nanocellulose might be useful for windows or electronic displays. Studies have shown that some forms of cellulose are piezoelectric, meaning they generate an electrical signal when deformed, so nanocellulose-based sensors could potentially monitor structures such as bridges for signs of stress. Nanocellulose food packaging could block oxygen permeation and keep the contents from spoiling, while nanocellulose scaffolds implanted in the body might aid bone regeneration. And at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory in Maryland, researchers are investigating whether nanocellulose-reinforced materials could better protect soldiers on the battlefield.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Come on. 4 refineries in a 4 state region are effected at the same times by &#8220;disasters&#8221; that would be easy to contrive. In 2 of the biggest markets in the country, the Great Lakes Region and California. Can that be an accident? Looks highly suspicious to me. One thing is for sure everybody is loving those rising gas prices besides the drivers and President Obama. Maybe that is what they are after, defeating Barack Obama and electing one of their own, Mittens Romney.</p>

<h1>Fire is latest pollution problem at Chevron plant</h1>
<div id="cxStoryInfo"><a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/nation-world/">National / World News</a> 12:06 p.m. Thursday, August 9, 2012</div>
<p>By JASON DEAREN</p>
<p>The Associated Press</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — A massive Chevron oil refinery fire that sent hundreds of people rushing to hospitals and is pushing West Coast <a href="http://g.ajc.com/r/C7/">gas prices</a> higher was just the latest pollution incident at the facility that records show has increasingly violated air quality rules over the past five years.</p>
<p>The refinery is one of three such facilities near San Francisco that rank among the state&#8217;s top 10 emitters of toxic chemicals, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s Toxic Release Inventory.</p>
<p>Chevron&#8217;s Richmond refinery — the scene of Monday&#8217;s fire that shrouded the area in black smoke — has been cited by San Francisco Bay area regulators for violating air regulations 93 times in the past five years.</p>
<p>The number has increased from 15 violations in 2007 to 23 in both 2010 and 2011. The refinery is also the state&#8217;s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, according to state regulators.</p>

RJ Reynolds eventually got it but it cost it billions. All of the asbestos people eventually got it too. But the Koch Brothers were just gona prove them wrong. I do not know whether it is endemic  to capitalism but this &#8220;prove them wrong&#8221; phase is what the space exploration crowd is experiencing right now. Call it the Buck Rogers phenomena but private companies will fail to develop space much like Climate Change needed to stop 30 years ago.  30 years from now the space people are going to be wondering what happened to their dreams&#8230;if any of us are still left alive.</p>

<h1>Koch-funded climate scientist: I was wrong, humans are to blame</h1>
<p>By Jonathan Terbush<br />
Sunday, July 29, 2012 14:16 EDT</p>
<p>The founder and director of a climate change study project funded heavily by the Koch brothers, who last year reversed course and said he believed global warming was real, has gone one step further, writing in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/opinion/the-conversion-of-a-climate-change-skeptic.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all">weekend op-ed in the New York Times </a>that he is now convinced the phenomenon is caused by humans.</p>
<p>In a piece titled, “The Conversion of a Climate-Change Skeptic,” Richard A. Muller, a University of California, Berkley physicist who founded the Berkley Earth Surface Temperature study (BEST) wrote that his, “total turnaround, in such a short time,” was driven by a new report from the group that concluded for the first time that global warming is a man-made problem. That revelation brings Muller essentially full circle from his stance a few years ago, when he criticized other global warming studies as flawed and questioned whether the Earth was even warming abnormally, dangerously fast at all.</p>
<p>“Science is that narrow realm of knowledge that, in principle, is universally accepted,” Muller wrote. “I embarked on this analysis to answer questions that, to my mind, had not been answered. I hope that the Berkeley Earth analysis will help settle the scientific debate regarding global warming and its human causes.”</p>
<p>The BEST study, he wrote, found that the Earth had warmed by about two and a half degrees over the past 250 years, with the bulk of that spike occurring in the past 50 years. Moreover, he found that, “essentially all of this increase” was likely due to greenhouse gas emissions, a point climate change believers have accepted as fact for years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I posted on the transit of Venus, I said that environmentalists are concerned about the environment and that does not end at the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere or the heliosphere of even our galaxy. Human&#8217;s track record ain&#8217;t great so far. We tend to just throw stuff out there because we can. We have fired rockets willy nilly at planets some of which landed successfully but will be on those planets forever. The ones that didn&#8217;t go so well are smashed all over the place. We trashed the moon and anyone flying by the Earth would just go EWWWWWW. Look at that mess. So now what is proposed &#8211; Mining and Manufacturing. Environmentally things we do just the bestest. This is not good. Double billing here. This guy:</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/06/14/will-we-ever-live-on-the-moon/">http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/06/14/will-we-ever-live-on-the-moon/</a></p>
<p>wrote the op/ed piece here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120613-will-we-ever-live-on-the-moon">http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120613-will-we-ever-live-on-the-moon</a></p>
<p>This is not an attack on the writer by the way.</p>
<h1>Will we ever&#8230; live on the Moon?</h1>
<p>14 June 2012</p>
<p>by PHIL PLAIT</p>
<p>Will mankind once again walk on the lunar surface? I wouldn’t even  hesitate to say “yes”, because the future is long, and who in the early  1950s would have dared to predict that we would even land a craft on the  Moon within 20 years? But in this case, the answer probably isn’t as  interesting as the question itself – more specifically, when, and why,  and how will we do it?</p>
<p>I can think of many possible scenarios that  could lead to us colonising the Moon: an extended economic boom that  allows us to fund ambitious space exploration; a breakthrough in launch  costs which makes them drastically cheaper; or the discovery of some  vital natural resource on the Moon. But I don’t like betting on  breakthroughs.</p>
<p>A better question is then: “What is a likely way  we’ll end up with a human presence on the Moon?” Given what we know  today and extrapolating from there, I have a thought on how this could  happen.</p>
<p><strong>Looking into the abyss</strong></p>
<p>Before we talk about settling down on our rocky neighbour, we have to ask why we should head there in the first place.</p>
<p>Looking  back on nearly 60 years of space exploration, the answer is obvious.  Satellite communication. Weather prediction. Understanding of climate  change. Instantaneous broadcasting of radio and television. Global  positioning technology. Detailed mapping of the Earth. Environmental  monitoring. Government intelligence gathering (which has prevented far  more conflict than people credit it for). Disaster warning.</p>

<p>Go there and read. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Already a group of scientists and volunteers moved a butterfly north because of the warming climate. Our zoos are being referred to as &#8220;lifeboats&#8221; for extinct &#8220;in the wild&#8221; animals. This is no longer funny. People should be going to jail for this but it turns out that jails are only for poor people and white collar criminals not the uber wealthy who control the literal power structure that is causing this.</p>

<h1>Extinctions from Climate Change Underestimated</h1>
</div>

<div>Wynne Parry, LiveScience Senior Writer</div>

<div>
<p>As climate change progresses, the planet may lose more plant and animal species than predicted, a new modeling study suggests.</p>
<p>This is because current predictions overlook two important factors: the  differences in how quickly species relocate and competition among  species, according to the researchers, led by Mark Urban, an ecologist  at the University of Connecticut.</p>
<p>Already evidence suggests that <a href="http://www.livescience.com/15640-species-shifting-climate-change.html">species have begun to migrate</a> out of ranges made inhospitable by climate change and into newly hospitable territory.</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;We have really sophisticated meteorological models for predicting  climate change,&#8221; Urban said in a statement. &#8220;But in real life, animals  move around, they compete, they parasitize each other and they eat each  other. The majority of our predictions don&#8217;t include these important  interactions.&#8221;</p>
