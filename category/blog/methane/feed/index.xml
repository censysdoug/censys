<p>Unusually hot and dry conditions in parts of the northern hemisphere have been conducive to fires raging from the Mediterranean to – in particular – the Arctic. Climate change, with rising temperatures and shifts in precipitation patterns, is amplifying the risk of wildfires and prolonging the season.</p>
<p>WMO’s Global Atmosphere Watch Programme has released a <a href="http://https://youtu.be/ZfJsedQlio0">short animation</a> which highlights the risks and explains how advances in satellite technology make it possible to detect and monitor fire dangers. Improving forecasting systems is important for predictions and warnings around fire danger and related air pollution hazards.</p>
<p>In addition to the direct threat from burning, wildfires also release harmful pollutants including particulate matter and toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and non-methane organic compounds into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Particles and gases from burning biomass can be carried over long distances, affecting air quality in regions far away.</p>
<p><strong>Heatwaves fuel fires</strong></p>

<p>New plans to build two commercial <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-the-offshore-wind-industry-is-about-to-take-off-95997" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offshore wind farms</a> near the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> and <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rhode-island">Rhode Island</a> coasts have sparked a lot of <a href="http://capeandislands.org/post/vineyard-wind-hears-public-concerns#stream/0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussion</a> about the <a href="https://www.boem.gov/Offshore-Wind-Energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vast potential of this previously untapped source of electricity</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="Raw-s1p4r1tl-0 jioFUO">
<p>But as <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_h0VdMkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an environmental health and climate researcher</a>, I&#8217;m intrigued by how this gust of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/11/7/074019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offshore wind power</a> may improve <a href="https://www.usnews.com/topics/subjects/public_health">public health</a>. Replacing fossil fuels with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2771" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wind and solar energy</a>, research shows, can <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce risks of asthma, hospitalizations and heart attacks</a>. In turn, that can save lives.</p>
</div>
<div class="Raw-s1p4r1tl-0 jioFUO">
<p>So my colleagues and I calculated the health impact of generating electricity through <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/5/25/17393156/offshore-wind-us-massachusetts-rhode-island-zinke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offshore wind turbines</a> – which until now the U.S. has barely begun to do.</p>

<p><b>Greening the Grid</b></p>
</div>
<div class="Raw-s1p4r1tl-0 jioFUO">
<p>New England gets almost none of its electricity from burning coal and more than three-quarters of it from burning <a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/about/key-stats/resource-mix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural gas and operating nuclear reactors</a>. The rest is from hydropower and from renewable energy, including wind and solar power and the burning of wood and refuse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me be clear here, the transition to clean energy sources will be painful because it is unplanned. Consider this: What if the Federal Government had a plan to move away from fossil fuels with clear benchmarks for the shift and training programs to move workers into that market. Well, plants would be closed on a schedule that everyone knows in advance, and there would be no pain. Only growth and prosperity. The way we are going about it now, Nuclear Power gets classified as &#8220;green&#8221;, plants are shuttered and workers are thrown out of their jobs. Brilliant.</p>

<h1 class="article-headline">Two Ohio coal-fired plants to close, deepening industry decline</h1>
<div id="article-byline"><span class="author">By <a href="http://www.reuters.com/journalists/emily-flitter">Emily Flitter</a></span> <span class="location"><span class="divider">|</span> NEW YORK</span></div>
<p>Electricity company Dayton Power &amp; Light said on Monday it would shut down two coal-fired power plants in southern Ohio next year for economic reasons, a setback for the ailing coal industry but a victory for environmental activists.</p>
<p>Republican President Donald Trump promised in his election campaign to restore U.S. coal jobs that he said had been destroyed by environmental regulations put into effect by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Dayton Power &amp; Light, a subsidiary of The AES Corporation, said in an emailed statement that it planned to close the J.M. Stuart and Killen plants by June 2018 because they would not be &#8220;economically viable beyond mid-2018.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coal demand has flagged in recent years due to competition from cheap and plentiful natural gas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When homosapiens invented fire did we doom ourselves? Because it seems fire will always come into contact with fire and global warming is the result. I think this implies that there is a limit on large animals ability to survive on Earth. I think it means that the Earth is locked into cycles of mass die offs. Finally, I think it means humans better get out of here soon. Yet, I wonder why that is just dawning on me at 60?</p>

<p>From the back kitchen window of his little house on a ridge in east-central Pennsylvania, John Lokitis looks out on a most unusual prospect. Just uphill, at the edge of St.IgnatiusCemetery, the earth is ablaze. Vegetation has been obliterated along a quarter-mile strip; sulfurous steam billows out of hundreds of fissures and holes in the mud. There are pits extending perhaps 20 feet down: in their depths, discarded plastic bottles and tires have melted. Dead trees, their trunks bleached white, lie in tangled heaps, stumps venting smoke through hollow centers. Sometimes fumes seep across the cemetery fence to the grave of Lokitis’ grandfather, George Lokitis.</p>
<div class="associated-container"></div>
<p>This hellish landscape constitutes about all that remains of the once-thriving town of Centralia, Pennsylvania. Forty-three years ago, a vast honeycomb of coal mines at the edge of the town caught fire. An underground inferno has been spreading ever since, burning at depths of up to 300 feet, baking surface layers, venting poisonous gases and opening holes large enough to swallow people or cars. The conflagration may burn for another 250 years, along an eight-mile stretch encompassing 3,700 acres, before it runs out of the coal that fuels it.</p>
</div>
<p>Remarkably enough, nobody’s doing a thing about it. The federal and state governments gave up trying to extinguish the fire in the 1980s. “Pennsylvania didn’t have enough money in the bank to do the job,” says Steve Jones, a geologist with the state’s Office of Surface Mining. “If you aren’t going to put it out, what can you do? Move the people.”Nearly all 1,100 residents left after they were offered federally funded compensation for their properties. Their abandoned houses were leveled. Today Centralia exists only as an eerie grid of streets, its driveways disappearing into vacant lots. Remains of a picket fence here, a chair spindle there—plus Lokitis and 11 others who refused to leave, the occupants of a dozen scattered structures. Lokitis, 35, lives alone in the house he inherited from “Pop”—his grandfather, a coal miner, as was Pop’s father before him. For fans of the macabre, lured by a sign warning of DANGER from asphyxiation or being swallowed into the ground, Centralia has become a tourist destination. For Lokitis, it is home.</p>

<h2><a href="http://needtoknow.nas.edu/energy/energy-use/">How We Use Energy</a></h2>
<h3>Home &amp; Work</h3>
<p><strong>We use energy in homes and commercial buildings</strong> in similar ways. We keep rooms at comfortable temperatures, provide lighting, heat water for bathing and hand washing, and power computers, copiers, appliances, and other technologies. Many of these luxuries weren’t even possible 100 years ago—and they require a lot of energy. In 2008, 41% of all the energy consumed in the United States went to powering homes and commercial buildings.</p>
<blockquote><p>Many of these luxuries weren’t even possible 100 years ago—and they require a lot of energy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whether you live in an apartment, townhouse, or a single-family home, chances are you want to keep it warm in cold weather. Data from 2006 show that space heating accounts for the greatest energy usage in the residential sector, with the rest devoted, in decreasing proportions, to appliances, water heating, and air-conditioning. At 7%, electronics usage surpasses washers/dryers and dishwashers, cooking, and computers in energy use. Appliances such as <a href="http://needtoknow.nas.edu/energy/energy-efficiency/refrigeration/">refrigerators</a>, water heaters, and washers/dryers are all considerably more <a href="http://needtoknow.nas.edu/energy/energy-efficiency/">energy efficient</a> than they used to be, thanks to legislation that requires appliances to meet strict standards.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In U.S. homes, <a href="http://needtoknow.nas.edu/energy/energy-sources/fossil-fuels/natural-gas/">natural gas</a> is the most widely used energy source (49%), followed by the secondary energy source, <a href="http://needtoknow.nas.edu/energy/energy-sources/electricity/">electricity</a>, at 39%. That’s reversed in commercial buildings, where electricity (55%) is depended on more than natural gas (32%). The commercial sector includes a broad array of building types, including offices, grocery stores, sports arenas, schools, shopping malls, hotels, and hospitals. Practically any space where groups gather falls into this economic sector. The energy needs for these different buildings vary but when viewed as a whole, more than half of the energy used in commercial buildings goes to just heating (36%) and <a href="http://needtoknow.nas.edu/energy/energy-efficiency/lighting/">lighting</a> (21%). Within this sector, retail stores and service buildings use the most total energy (20%), followed by office buildings (17%) and schools (13%).</p>

<div class="post">
<p class="timestamp">By Tiffany Germain, Guest Contributor and <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/person/rkoronowski/">Ryan Koronowski</a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=koronet"><img decoding="async" class="twitter-bird" src="http://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/themes/tp4/images/bird_blue_16.png" alt="" /></a> <span class="posted-on"><time class="published" datetime="July 1, 2014 at 2:39 pm">July 1, 2014 at 2:39 </time></span></p>
</div>
<p>With all the recent talk at the federal level about the EPA’s proposed carbon regulations for new and existing power plants, it’s easy to forget about the executives that have front row seats to cutting American carbon pollution. And though climate deniers <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/06/26/2202141/the-anti-science-climate-denier-caucus-113th-congress-edition/">run rampant</a> through the halls of Congress, a <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate-guide-governors/">new analysis</a> from the CAP Action War Room reveals that half of America’s Republican governors agree with the anti-science caucus of Congress.</p>
<p>Fifteen out of twenty-nine sitting Republican governors deny climate science despite the overwhelming level of <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/05/15/2014211/study-finds-97-consensus-on-human-caused-global-warming-in-the-peer-reviewed-literature/">scientific consensus</a>, the <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/report/2013/09/12/73895/states-of-denial-states-with-the-most-federal-disaster-aid-sent-climate-science-deniers-to-congress-2/">enormous cost to taxpayers</a>, and the critical place governors occupy in implementing new limits on carbon pollution. None of the country’s Democratic governors have made public statements denying climate change.</p>
<p>This map from the analysis categorizes governors into four groups: green for those who both accept climate science and are taking action to fight climate change; orange for those who either accept or haven’t openly denied climate science, but also have yet to take serious action to address climate change; red for those who have failed to take action or openly rejected to federal safeguards to address climate change, and red with stripes for climate deniers.</p>

So the 2 big questions this raises is 1) Will this have an effect on Chicago&#8217;s electric rates and  renewable goals. and 2) will the WE offer Chicago a new and improved natural gas deal? We shall see. Ameren must be wondering the same sort of things. Below are a short article link and then a longer treatment.</p>

<div id="story-body-text">It was just before Christmas that Gale Klappa, chairman and CEO of Wisconsin Energy Corp., asked Charlie Schrock, his counterpart at Chicago-based Integrys Energy Group Inc., out to dinner.Sitting in a restaurant in Chicago, Klappa didn’t mince words with the head of the parent company for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas.</p>
</div>
<p>“The first thing on my mind that I opened with in my discussion with Charlie is when you look at what the combined company would become in what is clearly a consolidating industry,” he recalled. “Size, scale and the ability to take advantage of the economies of scale is becoming more important.”</p>
<p>On Monday, six months after that dinner, the two CEOS were together again, announcing a $5.7 billion merger agreement that will create an energy company with more than 4.3 million metered electric and gas customers in Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota.</p>

<p>As for what I think:</p>
<p>Hydraulic Fracturing is a drilling process that drills oil and gas wells into shale formations and produces what is referred to as “ tight petroleum fluids”. Principally oil and methane. This process begins by drilling a typical vertical well.  The drill bit is then turned to drill horizontally and moves as far as 3 miles. Then the well is cased with concrete and a slurry of liquids are prepared. We will come back to that discussion in a bit because the fluids pumped into the bore hole are very special. Once the drill is extracted it is replaced with special pipe that is flexible enough to make the turn and has holes in it which are temporarily plugged with ping pong ball  like ball bearings. Once that is done, the fluids  are piped down the well under extremely high pressure. These fluids blast the bearings out of the way and the fluids escape from the pipe and pulverizes the surrounding rock. Then the danger of fracking begins. Because of the  physics of pressure, the fluids  which are now in front of the flow of the oil and methane burst back to the surface and must be contained. After that the dangers only grow. These risks include: Pollution risks, Health risks, Death risks and Financial risks.</p>
<p>The health risks are many. The groundwater risks arise from the fracking itself and the type fluids used. The fluids are extremely toxic.  While I can&#8221;t say what exactly are in the fluids because the drilling companies refuse to release them, everyone admits that toxics like diesel fuel, hydrochloric acid, silica, and antifreeze are involved.  For a list of the thousand of chemical used please see  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_additives_for_hydraulic_fracturing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_additives_for_hydraulic_fracturing</a> .   Will the fluids remain in the area fracked and will the oil and gas flow towards the well head if other avenues are available? This is something no one can guarantee. If even small amounts of the fracking fluids do not return through the bore hole then ground water contamination is possible and well water contamination is all but guaranteed. Surface contamination comes in the form of produced water contamination on the ground and in the nearby waterways. Many wild catters want to just dump those waters in waste pits or worse yet dump them in larger stream and rivers. Even tank storage is problematic. Transportation to a disposal site risks many types of accidents. I believe that all these fluids should be recycled. They contain radioactive materials, heavy metals and poisons like arsenic. Finally there is air pollution. This come in the form of methane and benzene. Many wild catters want to flare the methane and only deal with the oil. This guarantees that methane will be released and methane is one of the most potent green gases around. Exposure to benzene can be lethal as will be discussed later and will lead to lung damage and many cancers.</p>
<p>Some of the health risks were discussed above but there are a set of studies to be considered. You can find these studies easily online but in their gist they ask the question, &#8220;Are children in fracking zones healthy&#8221;?  The answer is NO. In general children that live within a ten mile area of fracked wells have many more health problems than children that live farther away. Please see this list for a discussion of benzene on human health &#8211; <a href="http://www.allenstewart.com/practice-areas/gas-property-damage/chemicals-used-in-fracking/">http://www.allenstewart.com/practice-areas/gas-property-damage/chemicals-used-in-fracking/</a>   If that is true then how healthy can the adults be? But fracking is so new that it is hard to tell. I know in my heart that taking that plunge over that cliff is not worth the danger. We need to stop now.</p>
<p>Then there are risks of death to the nearby humans. Is that extreme? Not in the least. The increase in the large truck traffic alone and the attendant violations of trucking laws will destroy roads and lead to a large increase in traffic accidents leading to increases in deaths. And of course there will be deaths directly relating to the increase in drilling activity. Drilling for oil is inherently dangerous and the industry has its own mortality rate. We have already seen large numbers of deaths due to train wrecks involving trains pulling tanker cars holding fracked oil. Because of the trapped gases in fracked oil it is a lot more explosive. Who wants to die a fiery death? While pipeline leaks could have been discussed anywhere, the problems of pipelining unconventional oil are clear. Since the oil must be heated under pressure to physically move through a pipeline, any leak means the oil cools rapidly and latches on to anything in its path. Especially if it falls into water it will not float and it must be dug out of the bottom. Wherever it lands it begins to release its toxic chemicals including the ever present benzene. While no deaths have yet occurred, fracking possess the possibility of causing major calamities. The first are earthquakes. Today there is no doubt that fracking can cause earthquakes. The questions is when will they cause a major one? So far no earthquake caused by fracking has been greater than a 4.5 earthquake, so we continue to pray they stay small. Then there is the question of Bhopal On The Prairie. This was not a concern of mine but many people who live near old coal mines raised it with me at events I attended. They said, &#8220;What if they frack near an old coal mine or an old uncapped oil well&#8221; both of which Illinois has in abundance? Well the answer is, all the stuff that should go up the nrw well bore hole will spew out into the general environment. If you are anywhere near that the methane will kill you. This is unlikely but just one incident could kill many people.</p>
<p>Ever wonder why oil men refer to their business as a “Boom and Bust” business? It is because of their Financial Risks. These risks are not limited to the investors and the drillers themselves. First and foremost any property owners near these wells will see their property values go to zero and if you hold a mortgage on any such property you will be in debt for a worthless property. There is also a growing push to send the fracked oil and its refined products overseas. This means that oil prices will rise and the cost of gasoline will follow along. But ultimately it is the case that  wildcat fracking is a Ponzi Scheme and that costs investors the most money. Small drillers raise money well by well but when the first one “comes in” they divert some of the profits to the next well which enriches themselves. Because fracked wells have such a short life expectancy (possibly as short as 3 years) eventually the level of those losing money on their investments climb and the driller declares bankruptcy leaving those newest investors holding huge losses. Not only that but it leaves the State of Illinois and individual property owners holding the bag for any damages that remains. This also leads to market manipulation on insider information because the upcoming bankruptcies are an open secret in the oil and gas industry itself.</p>
<p>I must end with a plea for Illinois to stop this. Fracking is nothing but a case of gluttony gone wild. These are not resources we need to exploit now. We could leave these resources for future generations that may need them. But in our general lust for fatter and fatter energy girths we will be looked on by future generations with mortification. Again, shame on everyone in Illinois.</p>

<p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has finalized a voluntary agreement designed to protect the lesser prairie chicken and its dwindling habitat from oil and gas drilling activity as the deadline approaches for the service to decide whether to list the colorful bird as threatened.</p>
<p>FWS and the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (WAFWA) announced late Friday that they had signed the formal <a href="http://www.fws.gov/coloradoes/Lesser_prairie_chicken/02%2028%2014%20Draft%20CCAA%20with%20CI%20Revised_Clean_WAFWA.pdf">agreement</a>, called the Range-wide Oil and Gas Candidate Conservation Agreement With Assurances.</p>
<p>Landowners and companies that enroll in the Candidate Conservation Agreement With Assurances (CCAA) through WAFWA agree to take steps to protect lesser prairie chicken habitat and to pay a mitigation fee if their actions harm the bird&#8217;s habitat. In exchange, the service agrees not to impose any further restrictions or mandates on the participants if the bird is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.</p>
