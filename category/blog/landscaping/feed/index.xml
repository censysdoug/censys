										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week&#8217;s articles says &#8211; Not Likely. I say the trees are a good start. The point is that some people argue for trees or solar panels in the desert for instance. But the desert is an ecosystem that trees or solar panels would disrupt. Deserts are not &#8220;throw away&#8221; ecosystems. So we can only deploy so much of each. This is why i think geothermal is the ultimate solution.</p>

<p>Last week, a new study in the journal <em><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Science (opens in a new tab)">Science</a></em> highlighted the role forests could play in <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2019/07/04/could-planting-tons-of-trees-solve-climate-change/#.XR9vR9NKjm1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="tackling climate change (opens in a new tab)">tackling climate change</a>. Researchers estimated that by restoring forests to their maximum potential, we could cut down atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) by 25 percent — a move that would take us back to levels not seen in over a century. Though the study brings hope in the fight against climate change, other experts warn the solution is not that simple.</p>
<p>The study, led by scientists at ETH-Zürich, Switzerland, determined the planet has 0.9 billion hectares of land available to hold more trees — an area the size of the continental U.S. Converting those areas into forests would be a game-changer for climate change, the authors suggested.</p>
<p>“[The study] is probably the best assessment we have to date of how much land could support tree cover on our planet,” says Robin Chazdon, a forest ecologist and professor emeritus at the University of Connecticut not involved in the study, But she is quick to point out that restoring forests is not as simple as it sounds.</p>

<p>Go there and think. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What they don&#8217;t tell you that you would have to plant enough trees to cover North America TWICE. That is a trillion trees. Now we could do that. The cool thing is that saplings soak up huge amounts of Carbon so we might get a decade of Global Cooling which we could use. But we would need a second solution for Ocean Acidification. I am sure we could do the acid thing eventually. Still, getting a trillion trees? Well we shall see.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/planting-1-trillion-trees-could-stop-climate-change-argues-study/a-49478494">https://www.dw.com/en/planting-1-trillion-trees-could-stop-climate-change-argues-study/a-49478494</a></p>
<div class="col3">

<h1>Planting 1 trillion trees could stop climate change, argues study</h1>
<p class="intro">Planting a massive number of trees is the most effective way to combat global warming, scientists have said. Reforesting an area the size of the United States could capture two-thirds of manmade carbon emissions.</p>
</div>
<div class="col3">
<div class="picBox full"><a class="overlayLink init" href="https://www.dw.com/en/planting-1-trillion-trees-could-stop-climate-change-argues-study/a-49478494#" rel="nofollow"> <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" title="Trees in a park" src="https://www.dw.com/image/49330325_303.jpg" alt="Trees in a park" width="700" height="394" /> </a></div>
<div class="group">
<div class="longText">
<p>A report from Swiss scientists published on Thursday said an effective way to stem the catastrophic consequences of <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/europe-heat-wave-sparks-massive-wildfire-in-spain-record-temperatures-in-france/a-49382191">climate change</a> would be to plant about 1 trillion trees. This would take up an area roughly the size of the United States, but there is more than enough room, according to the study published in the journal <em>Science.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Every other climate change solution requires that we all change our behavior, or we need some top-down decision from a politician who may or may not believe in climate change, or it&#8217;s a scientific discovery we don&#8217;t yet have,&#8221; researcher Tom Crowther told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. &#8220;This one is not only our most powerful solution — it&#8217;s one that every single one of us can get involved with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over decades, the growing trees could suck up nearly 830 billion tons (750 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, according to the study. That&#8217;s about as much carbon pollution as humans have spewed in the past 25 years.</p>
<p>Crowther added, however, that while this was a cheap solution, it would not work without emissions cuts. Researchers emphasized that there are also behavioral changes that would work faster, such as cutting animal products out of one&#8217;s diet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Families are starting to move into what is being called America&#8217;s first solar-powered town,&#8221; announces <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/sexual-misconduct/john-dickerson-replaces-charlie-rose-cbs-morning-n836096" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Dickerson</a> for CBS This Morning on Jan. 16. &#8220;<a href="https://www.babcockranch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Babcock Ranch</a>, about half an hour northeast of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Myers,_Florida" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fort Myers,</a> Florida, is supposed to produce more energy than it consumes once it&#8217;s finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>Developer <a href="http://kitsonpartners.com/executive-team/sydney-kitson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syd Kitson</a> is building 20,000 homes for a projected 50,000 people, states Dickerson in the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/inside-floridas-solar-powered-babcock-ranch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newscast video </a>accompanying the article.</p>
<blockquote><p>There are more than 300,000 solar panels spread across 440 acres there, producing enough electricity not only for the town, but also the surrounding areas, reports CBS News&#8217; <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/team/manuel-bojorquez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manuel Bojorquez</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>One critical energy element lacking in the solar-powered community will be adequate energy storage to allow the city to be truly self-powered:</p>
<blockquote><p>The town doesn&#8217;t run on solar power all the time. At night, when the sun is down, it has to draw from the traditional electrical grid. Kitson says the technology for storing all that surplus energy the solar cells generate during the day is still too costly.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I agreed to publish this here because it is such a different perspective then the one I have or CES has. We tend to blame builders for not just serving up top notch energy efficient residences. Then there is the issue of retrofitting. As always this is no endorsement of Ryan or his Real Estate firm. Believe me I have no intention of buying a home in Alaska.</p>

More buyers see the value of it, and more builders and sellers are starting to make changes in that direction. There is still a long way to go before energy efficiency and reducing waste becomes the standard for new homes and improved existing homes, but a larger pool of buyers demanding these features can help move the needle bit by bit.</div>

<blockquote><p>Langfelder and Ted Meckes, City Water, Light and Power’s water division manager, met with representatives from the Army Corps of Engineers, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, following the Springfield City Council’s reaffirmation vote in July of a commitment to move forward with the Hunter Lake projec</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I found myself doing 2 big things today: saucing tomatoes and contemplating what to do with Paw Paws. On the same theme I was considering what to post today when the two lines ran together. Of course when you plant a trees (Paw Paws) you are fighting global warming. Harvesting your own food (Paw Paws and tomatoes) is both buying local and cutting transportation costs at the same time.</p>
<p>So this is the Arbor Day Foundations take.</p>

<h1>How Trees Fight Climate Change</h1>
<p class="intro">Whether you plant trees around your home and property, in your community, or in our national forests, they help fight climate change. Through the natural process of photosynthesis, trees absorb <span class="caps">CO<sup>2</sup></span> and other pollutant particulates, then store the carbon and emit pure oxygen.</p>
<p>See how planting trees helps fight climate change.</p>

<p>Elephants are the largest living land mammals on the planet.<br />
Incredibly intelligent and social, they have no real predators in the wild. Except humans.</p>
<p>Due to their magnificent ivory tusks, which are carved and sold as luxury ornaments, elephants have been hunted for centuries. Now they are diminishing at such a rapid pace, that we risk losing them for good.<strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes I know there are many things that are wrong about Las Vegas. People shouldn&#8217;t even be there in the first place. The rape of the river that no longer reaches the sea. The rape of the pristine desert and the death of many Native Americans. I lived there for a year and there is also the cheesy nature of the culture. But when they do something right, you got to give them credit.</p>

<h1>Nevada Energy Star Partners Demonstrate Peak Performance (Web Only)</h1>
<div>BY <a href="http://www.homeenergy.org/list/author/id/946">ANNETTE BUBAK</a></div>
<div>September 01, 2012</div>
<p>Las Vegas may appear balmy and inviting with its sparkling pools and  swaying palm trees, but those who live in Neon City know the truth: It’s  too cold in the winter and too hot in the summer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, hundreds of thousands of homes that were built during  an amazing 50 years of rapid growth in the Southwest do not incorporate  modern advances in energy performance to accommodate the wild swings of  desert climate. As temperatures climb to 110°F in the summer, many homes  leak large amounts of cooled air through gaps in ducts, roofs, windows,  and doors. And when the frigid north wind drops the temperature below  freezing in the winter, heated air escapes, leaving living rooms and  bedrooms uncomfortably cold and drafty. While Las Vegans know their  climate, they may not realize that they are paying to heat and cool the  great outdoors.</p>
<p>The dramatic temperature shifts in the high-desert climate make Las  Vegas an ideal place for homeowners who are looking to make their homes  more comfortable and to save substantially on their energy bills. Funded  in part by DOE’s Building America program, the Building America  Retrofit Alliance is working with the Nevada ENERGY STAR Partners–Green  Alliance (NESP–Green Alliance), and with Better Building Performance, a  Las Vegas company, to upgrade two typical homes top to bottom. Their  goal has been to show homeowners and remodelers how easy and effective  energy performance upgrades can be.</p>
