										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Isn&#8217;t Russia Special. They are so inept they want to cause a second nuclear disaster at Chernobyl. Seriously does the world need a bigger excuse to intervene? Hell, we started a War in Vietnam over shots that WEREN&#8217;T fired. China has taken over countries just because a 1,000 ago they were part of China. But messing with multiple Nuclear Power Plants ain&#8217;t enough? Earth&#8217;s Countries are going to mess around here and have a real disaster on its hands.</p>

<p>LACEY TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) — For the second time in as many months, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has fined the owners of a former New Jersey nuclear power plant for security-related violations.</p>
<p>The agency said Wednesday it fined Jupiter, Florida-based Holtec Decommissioning International $50,000 for security violations at the former Oyster Creek nuclear power plant in the Forked River section of Lacey Township.</p>
<p>The plant was one of the oldest in the U.S. when it shut down in 2018.</p>
<p>The fine involved a company employee working as an armorer at the plant.</p>
<p>In an investigation that concluded in March 2021, the NRC determined the armorer “deliberately failed to properly perform required annual material-condition inspections of response unit rifles, and falsified related records.”</p>
<p>The plant has several fortified bunkers from which armed security staff can fight off attackers. The NRC said the violation was the work of “a now-former security superintendent.”</p>

<p>A second high-ranking employee of Westinghouse Electric is facing criminal charges in connection with the multi-billion dollar failure of the doomed nuclear project in Fairfield County.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Benjamin, a former Westinghouse senior vice president of new plants and projects, faces multiple counts of fraud, according to an 18-page indictment made public Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Columbia.</p>
<p>It is the latest criminal charge in a four-year federal investigation of what went wrong at the highest levels of two substantial American companies — Westinghouse and the former SCANA Corporation.</p>
<div class="caas-da">
<div id="sda-INARTICLE"></div>
</div>
<p>The charges against Benjamin are “for his role in failing to truthfully report information regarding construction of new nuclear units at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant,” Acting U.S. Attorney Rhett DeHart said in a <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://twitter.com/USAO_SC/status/1428082981189701641?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:press release" data-rapid_p="6" data-v9y="1">press release</a>.</p>
<p>Benjamin’s alleged cover-up of billions of dollars in losses at Westinghouse’s troubled nuclear plants in South Carolina and Georgia were part of a series of events leading to the company’s bankruptcy in March 2017, according to the indictment.</p>
<p>“The defendant’s misrepresentations and omissions, as well as the associated cover-up, resulted in billions of dollars in losses to (SCANA), ratepayers and investors,” the indictment said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People are always asking why Nuclear Power Plants cost so much. They want to blame regulation, or safety measures. Maybe even because of unnecessary cost over runs. Mainly they do this because &#8220;They want to build more NUCLEAR Power Plants&#8221;. But the fact of the matter is you can&#8217;t build them cheaper and in fact given the costs of the 2 Major Nuclear catastrophes, maybe you need to build them more expensive. The simple fact, is that a new Coal Fired Plant can cost 2 billion dollars and kill the atmosphere while a Uranium Fired Plant could cost 4 billion dollars and kill us.</p>
<p>Anyway here is some discussion of that:</p>

<p>Should any discussion of nuclear power go on for long enough, it becomes inevitable that someone will rant that the only reason it has become unaffordable is a proliferation of safety regulations. The argument is rarely (if ever) fleshed out—no specific regulation is ever identified as problematic, and there seems to be no consideration given to the fact that we might have learned something at, say, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/05/remediating-fukushima-when-everything-goes-to-hell-you-go-back-to-basics/">Fukushima</a> that might merit addressing through regulations.</p>

<p>But there&#8217;s now a paper out that provides some empirical evidence that safety changes have contributed to the cost of building new nuclear reactors. But the study also makes clear that they&#8217;re only one of a number of factors, accounting for only a third of the soaring costs. The study also finds that, contrary to what those in the industry seem to expect, focusing on standardized designs doesn&#8217;t really help matters, as costs continued to grow as more of a given reactor design was built.</p>
<h2>More of the same</h2>
<p>The analysis, done by a team of researchers at MIT, is remarkably comprehensive. For many nuclear plants, they have detailed construction records, broken out by which building different materials and labor went to, and how much each of them cost. There&#8217;s also a detailed record of safety regulations and when they were instituted relative to construction. Finally, they&#8217;ve also brought in the patent applications filed by the companies who designed the reactors. The documents describe the motivations for design changes and the problems those changes were intended to solve.</p>

<p>MOSCOW (AP) — Belarus&#8217; first nuclear power plant began operating Tuesday, a project that has spooked its neighbor Lithuania, which immediately cut off importing electricity from Belarus at the news.</p>
<p>The Russian-built Astravyets nuclear power plant, 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, has been connected to Belarus&#8217; power grid and has started producing electricity, according to Belarusian electricity operator Belenergo.</p>
<p>Lithuanian authorities long have opposed the plant&#8217;s construction, arguing that the project has been plagued by accidents, stolen materials and the mistreatment of workers. In line with the country&#8217;s law banning electricity imports from Belarus once the plant starts, Lithuania&#8217;s Litgrid power operator cut the inflow of electricity from Belarus upon receiving data that the Astravyets nuclear reactor had started producing energy.</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s state nuclear corporation Rosatom, which built the plant, has rejected the Lithuanian complaints, saying the plant&#8217;s design conforms to the highest international standards as confirmed by the International Atomic Energy Agency, a U.N. watchdog.</p>

<h2 class="body title">1. The Animals of Chernobyl Survived Against All Odds</h2>
<p class="body">The effects of the radioactive explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on April 26, 1986 devastated the environment. Around the plant and in the nearby city of Pripyat in Ukraine, the Chernobyl disaster’s radiation caused the leaves of thousands of trees to turn a rust color, giving a new name to the surrounding woods—the <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/56235-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-33-years-later-wildlife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Forest</a>. Workers eventually bulldozed and buried the radioactive trees. Squads of Soviet conscripts also were ordered to <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-happened-to-the-dogs-of-chernobyl-the-harrowing-events-of-the-tv-series-are-sadly-true-17928470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoot</a> any stray animals within the 1000-square-mile Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Though experts today believe parts of the zone will remain unsafe for humans for another <a href="https://www.livescience.com/39961-chernobyl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20,000 years</a>, numerous animal and plant species not only survived, but thrived.</p>
<h2 class="body title">2. Bears and Wolves Outnumber Humans Around the Chernobyl Disaster Site</h2>
<p class="body">While humans are strictly prohibited from living in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, many other species have settled there. Brown bears, wolves, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/33677/canada-lynx-ghost-cat-north" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">lynx</a>, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59248/whats-difference-between-bison-and-buffalo" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">bison</a>, deer, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59461/10-gigantic-facts-about-moose" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">moose</a>, beavers, foxes, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64760/10-resourceful-facts-about-badgers" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">badgers</a>, wild boar, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/70797/12-surprising-facts-about-raccoon-dogs" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">raccoon dogs</a>, and more than 200 species of birds have formed their own ecosystem within the Chernobyl disaster area.

<p class="">On behalf of environmentalists everywhere, I would like to formally apologize for the climate scare we created over the last 30 years. Climate change is happening. It’s just not the end of the world. It’s not even our most serious environmental problem.</p>
<p class="">I may seem like a strange person to be saying all of this. I have been a climate activist for 20 years and an environmentalist for 30.</p>
<p class="">But as an energy expert asked by Congress to provide objective expert testimony, and invited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to serve as Expert Reviewer of its next Assessment Report, I feel an obligation to apologize for how badly we environmentalists have misled the public.</p>
<p class="">Here are some facts few people know:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Humans are <em>not</em> causing a “sixth mass extinction”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">The Amazon is <em>not</em> “the lungs of the world”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Climate change is <em>not</em> making natural disasters worse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Fires have <em>declined </em>25% around the world since 2003</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">The amount of land we use for meat — humankind’s biggest use of land — has<em> declined</em> <em>by an area nearly as large as Alaska</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">The build-up of wood fuel and more houses near forests, <em>not</em> climate change, explain why there are more, and more dangerous, fires in Australia and California</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Carbon emissions are declining in most rich nations and have been declining in Britain, Germany, and France since the mid-1970s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Netherlands became rich not poor while adapting to life below sea level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">We produce 25% more food than we need and food surpluses will continue to rise as the world gets hotter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Habitat loss and the direct killing of wild animals are bigger threats to species than climate change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Wood fuel is far worse for people and wildlife than fossil fuels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Preventing future pandemics requires more not less “industrial” agriculture</p>
</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chernobyl and Fukushima released a lot of radiation. People died from the severe radiation released just after the accident, but &#8220;mild&#8221; consistent radiation is not dangerous to animals though it may have mild effects on adults and bigger effects on children. But the idea that a major radiation release would create one eyed giant humans or fire breathing dragons like wadzzilla is really remote. The fear of radiation has done some pretty amazing things for the environment, however.</p>

Once thought to be forever uninhabitable, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has become a haven for flora and fauna that prove that life, as they say in <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/49904/20-things-you-might-not-have-known-about-jurassic-park" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Jurassic Park</em></a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/oijEsqT2QKQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finds a way</a>.</p>
<h2 class="body title">1. The Animals of Chernobyl Survived Against All Odds</h2>
<p class="body">The effects of the radioactive explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on April 26, 1986 devastated the environment. Around the plant and in the nearby city of Pripyat in Ukraine, the Chernobyl disaster’s radiation caused the leaves of thousands of trees to turn a rust color, giving a new name to the surrounding woods—the <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/56235-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-33-years-later-wildlife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Forest</a>. Workers eventually bulldozed and buried the radioactive trees. Squads of Soviet conscripts also were ordered to <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-happened-to-the-dogs-of-chernobyl-the-harrowing-events-of-the-tv-series-are-sadly-true-17928470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoot</a> any stray animals within the 1000-square-mile Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Though experts today believe parts of the zone will remain unsafe for humans for another <a href="https://www.livescience.com/39961-chernobyl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20,000 years</a>, numerous animal and plant species not only survived, but thrived.</p>
<h2 class="body title">2. Bears and Wolves Outnumber Humans Around the Chernobyl Disaster Site</h2>
<p class="body">While humans are strictly prohibited from living in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, many other species have settled there. Brown bears, wolves, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/33677/canada-lynx-ghost-cat-north" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">lynx</a>, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59248/whats-difference-between-bison-and-buffalo" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">bison</a>, deer, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59461/10-gigantic-facts-about-moose" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">moose</a>, beavers, foxes, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64760/10-resourceful-facts-about-badgers" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">badgers</a>, wild boar, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/70797/12-surprising-facts-about-raccoon-dogs" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">raccoon dogs</a>, and more than 200 species of birds have formed their own ecosystem within the Chernobyl disaster area. Along with the larger animals, a variety of amphibians, fish, worms, and bacteria makes the unpopulated environment their home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was the original problem for/with Nuclear Power. It wasn&#8217;t the cost. It wasn&#8217;t the Carbon. It wasn&#8217;t about the size of the solution vs. the size of the problem. It wasn&#8217;t even the danger. It was the DURATION. This will be with humans forever. Maybe towards the end of our time here on Earth we can salvage some plutonium and uranium for constructive uses but that is forever too.</p>

<p class="first">A photo taken from the roof of Chernobyl&#8217;s old nuclear power plant has revealed how close the bushfires raging through Ukraine&#8217;s forests are from the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster.</p>
<div class="inline-content wysiwyg right">
<div class="inner">
<h2>Key points:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Crews are working to contain the forest fires burning through the territory surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear power plant</li>
<li>Radiation levels near the fires have been elevated, with the blazes producing swirling smoke</li>
<li>Winds are blowing smoke towards Kiev though authorities say radiation levels in the city remain normal</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>Firefighters are working to control the blazes burning through the irradiated forests in the territory surrounding the former nuclear plant.</p>
<p><a title="" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-07/fire-near-chernobyl-nuclear-plant-creates-radiation-spike/12127446" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiation levels near the wildfires have risen</a>, and the blazes have produced swirling smoke which is being blown towards neighbouring regions.</p>
<p>Winds had blown the smoke towards rural areas of Russia and nearby Belarus, but they shifted in the direction of Ukrainian capital Kiev over the weekend.</p>
<p>Authorities in Kiev, which has a population of about 3 million people, say radiation levels in the city remain normal.</p>
<p>Its citizens are already in lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The winds are more of a significant headache for the site of Chernobyl&#8217;s closed nuclear power plant. Strong gusts could spread the fires towards what is left of the facility as well as the abandoned equipment used to clean up the disaster.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the moment we cannot say the fire is contained,&#8221; acting head of the State Agency of Ukraine on Exclusion Zone Management Kateryna Pavlova said.</p>
