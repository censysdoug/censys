										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seriously, how long can it be before HUMANs realize that by killing the world in general they are killing themselves. Squeezing animals out of their habitats squeezes their viruses out into us. We have no immune defenses against them and we die. I mean it is Earth&#8217;s ultimate defense system. I have a hunch we are not gonna be around for long. Wonder which one will get us first, Global Warming or Rejection by the Earth.</p>

<p>In 2013, an 18-month-old boy got sick after playing near a hollow tree in his backyard in a remote West African village. He developed a fever and started vomiting. His stool turned black. Two days later, he died.</p>
<p>Two years and more than 11,000 deaths later, the World Health Organization put out a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/01/15/377517132/14-takeaways-from-the-14-part-who-report-on-ebola">report</a> saying the Ebola outbreak that likely emanated from that hollow tree may have been caused in part by deforestation led by &#8220;foreign mining and timber operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tree the boy played near was infested with insectivorous bats — bats that may have been pushed into the boy&#8217;s village because upward of 80% of their natural habitat had been destroyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you disturb a forest, it actually upsets, if you want, the balance of nature, the balance between pathogens and people,&#8221; says John E. Fa, a professor of biodiversity and human development at Manchester Metropolitan University, who was part of a team of researchers that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14727-9">linked recent forest loss to 25 Ebola outbreaks</a> that have occurred since 1976.</p>
<p>A finding, he says, that showed a strong correlation between recent deforestation and disease outbreaks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald J. Trump is the worst energy President of all time. That takes a lot of doing. Jimmie Carter was real bad on Nuclear Power. George Bush was seriously bad on natural gas and oil. But this alleged policy maker pledged, during the the 2016 campaign, that he would SAVE coal. Under his Presidency the Coal Market has plummeted as has its usage. Even though foreign markets were promised, they have plunged too. Oil futures at one point were trading in negative territory for the first time ever and Nuclear Power Plants are closing. He is opposed to Wind and Solar as they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFHh0Rs34v0">spread across the land</a>. I have a wind turbine within 15 minutes of my house in Riverton and I have a house with total roof solar panels around the corner from me. That says to me that the Cheeto Burito is about to lose office. We shall see.</p>

<p>MARION — Southern Illinois Power Cooperative plans to retire its largest coal-fired generator as early as this fall, a move that is expected to save $125 million over a decade.</p>
</div>
<div class="lee-article-text">
<p>President and CEO Don Gulley said the tentative decision is the result of analysis and negotiations that have been ongoing since late 2019. Gulley said SIPC utilized outside consultants to help it perform a comprehensive review of operations and determine the best path forward. The decision to close Unit 4, as it is known, was based on two primary factors, he said: sustained low energy prices in the wholesale power market, and increasingly costly environmental regulations for coal-fired generators.</p>

<p>As a result, up to 26 of the plant’s 82 employees are expected to face layoffs. Those employees are to receive a severance package under the terms of an agreement ratified by the IBEW Local 702, which represents workers, Gulley said.</p>

<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="18">(Bloomberg) &#8212; The Trump administration on Wednesday launched a legal assault on another of California’s plans to combat climate change, filing a lawsuit challenging the state’s carbon-cutting pact with Quebec.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="19">The lawsuit, filed in a Sacramento-based U.S. district court, argues the state stepped outside its proper constitutional lane by making a deal with the Canadian province on a cap-and-trade deal for limiting carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="20">The move is the latest in a series of actions the Trump administration has taken against California as it simultaneously challenges the state’s authority to set aggressive greenhouse gas emissions-cutting mandates on vehicles and complains the state has been too lax in confronting local pollution problems.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="21">The administration argues that the Constitution bars states from making treaties or compacts with foreign powers &#8212; like the regional cap-and-trade agreement California entered into with Quebec in 2013.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="22">Such foreign policy matters are the purview of the federal government, the Justice Department asserts.</p>

<p class="speakable-p-1 p-text">The embers of the coal industry have been slowly fading in recent years, despite efforts by the Trump administration to reignite the flames.</p>
<p class="speakable-p-2 p-text">But an announcement this week from a northern Indiana utility — in the heart of a state that ranks in the top 10 for both coal production and consumption — suggests the end may be nearer than some expect.</p>
<p class="p-text">After having already announced plans to <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/environment/2018/09/20/move-over-coal-indiana-utility-switching-solar-and-wind/1369539002/" data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a">speed up the retirement of its coal power plants</a>, the Northern Indiana Public Service Company said this week that it will switch to renewable energy to make its electricity instead.</p>
<p class="p-text">Why? Because it&#8217;s cheaper. A lot cheaper, they said, to the tune of more than $4 billion over a few decades. Still, those long-term savings might come with a short-term price. The utility is asking for a raise in its rates to upgrade infrastructure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I dare you to Google: Climate Change and plant life or Climate Change and small mammals. Most people who protest Global Warming, that is  &#8211; say it ain&#8217;t happening, talk about deserts shifting and extinctions leading to our vary own. They say that since those things aren&#8217;t happening, then Global Warming isn&#8217;t either. But in the beginning it will be increases in insect born diseases, increases in storm strength, and increases in drought. Here is just one example.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-climate-change-is-helping-invasive-species-take-over-180947630/">https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-climate-change-is-helping-invasive-species-take-over-180947630/</a></p>

<div class="pw-hidden-cp">
<p>Since the beginning of the 20th century, the growing season in many areas of the lower 48 states has expanded by about two weeks. Frosts end earlier in the spring and begin later in the fall. To gardeners in Maine, Wisconsin and Montana, that might seem a blessing. What’s not to like about more lettuce or riper tomatoes?</p>
<p>The longer seasons, however, are also helping invasive plants annex American soil; extended springs mean they can more quickly push aside native species and transform ecosystems. “What’s interesting about climate change is that humans are effectively manipulating how species experience time,” says ecologist Elizabeth Wolkovich of the Biodiversity Research Centre at the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p>Wolkovich and her colleagues have been studying how the first flowering dates of plants have changed over the years in Kansas, North Dakota, Washington, D.C., Concord, Massachusetts—where Henry David Thoreau kept notes about the flowers blooming near Walden Pond in the mid-1800s—as well as Britain.</p>

<p>High temperatures are forecast to reach the mid-80s this week in New York, and I’m dreading it. But I have a plan to stay cool: just thinking of how much hotter it is in Pakistan, which is in the middle of a blistering heat wave.</p>
<p>Temperatures <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1404959" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported to have </a>cracked 50.2 degrees Celsius (122.3 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday in Nawabshah, located about 127 miles northeast of Karachi. If confirmed, that could make the measurement not just the hottest ever recorded for April in Pakistan, but the hottest ever reliably recorded for April anywhere on Earth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The real important point from this article for me is that, &#8216;The die was cast around 1998, when GDP growth and electricity demand growth became “decoupled”&#8217;. In other words, for the last 2o years the utilities should have been investing in renewables and they did not. The point being that renewables are easier to turn &#8220;off&#8221; when you do not need them. If the utilities start investing heavily now in renewables they may survive. It is a horse race at this point.</p>

<p>In all that bedlam, it’s easy to lose sight of an equally important (if less sexy) trend: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-25/u-s-power-demand-flatlined-years-ago-and-it-s-hurting-utilities">Demand for electricity is stagnant</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to a combination of greater energy efficiency, outsourcing of heavy industry, and customers generating their own power on site, demand for utility power has been flat for 10 years, and most forecasts expect it to <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/data/browser/#/?id=8-AEO2017&amp;region=0-0&amp;cases=ref2017&amp;start=2015&amp;end=2050&amp;f=A&amp;linechart=~ref2017-d120816a.56-8-AEO2017&amp;ctype=linechart&amp;sourcekey=0">stay that way</a>. The die was cast around 1998, when GDP growth and electricity demand growth became “decoupled”:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sorry this is so late but the Christmas Season collided with my volunteering at Dana Thomas House which collided with the death of my dear friend Bob Paddack. Plus my car developed a penchant for flat tires. So I have been breathless. I could have ended on a downer note by posting about dumbass 45&#8217;s attempts to repeal regulations put in place after the Deep Water Horizon&#8217;s humongous oil spill, but that is insane so without further ado.</p>

<p>The world&#8217;s first commercial plant for capturing carbon dioxide directly from the air opened yesterday, refueling a debate about whether the technology can truly play a significant role in removing greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The Climeworks AG facility near Zurich becomes the first ever to capture CO2 at industrial scale from air and sell it directly to a buyer</p>
</div>
</article>
<p>Developers say the plant will capture about 900 tons of CO2 annually — or the approximate level released from 200 cars — and pipe the gas to help grow vegetables.</p>
<p>While the amount of CO2 is a small fraction of what firms and climate advocates hope to trap at large fossil fuel plants, Climeworks says its venture is a first step in their goal to capture 1 percent of the world&#8217;s global CO2 emissions with similar technology. To do so, there would need to be about 250,000 similar plants, the company says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Highly scalable negative emission technologies are crucial if we are to stay below the 2-degree target [for global temperature rise] of the international community,&#8221; said Christoph Gebald, co-founder and managing director of Climework</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, announced in Tennessee that the &#8220;War On Coal&#8221; was over. This during his announcement that the EPA was with drawing the Clean Power Plan proposed by the Obama Administration. What a joke this administration is. They accuse the former head of the EPA, <a id="yui_3_10_0_1_1507732472206_940" class=" td-u" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_McCarthy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gina McCarthy </a>,  of picking winners and losers. Well guess what? They have already been picked. Coal lost.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/2017/10/09/texas-monticello-power-plant-closes-signaling-undeniable-shift-natural-gas-renewable-energy">http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/2017/10/09/texas-monticello-power-plant-closes-signaling-undeniable-shift-natural-gas-renewable-energy</a></p>
<h1 id="art-title" class="art-title / p-name">Texas&#8217; Monticello power plant closes, signaling the undeniable shift to natural gas and renewable energy</h1>
<h3 id="yui_3_10_0_1_1507732472206_941" class="title">Dallas Morning News Editorial</h3>
<p>If there were any remaining doubts, the age of coal is over and the era of natural gas and renewables is officially here.</p>
<p>Luminant&#8217;s decision last week to shut its Monticello Power Plant near Mount Pleasant, one of Texas&#8217; largest and dirtiest coal-fired electricity plants, is a prime example of this shift. The plant&#8217;s pending closure in January is a win for clean air and the result of the new economics of energy that renders coal-fired power plants like the Monticello facility cost-prohibitive relics.</p>
<p>This is particularly true in Texas: Hydraulic fracturing has made natural gas production cleaner and cheaper than coal.  Each year, electricity from <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/energy/2015/05/26/on-texas-power-grid-coals-prominence-is-sliding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sun and wind contribute more megawatts</a> to the state&#8217;s power grid. The state&#8217;s deregulated electricity market increases competition, which leaves <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/energy/2017/01/19/getting-rid-coal-power-plants-led-one-stunning-statistic-eia-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">costly, emissions belching coal-fired power plants </a>like Monticello on the wrong side of a historic transformation.</p>
<h3>We&#8217;re pleased that Luminant took this step after a year-long review of its operations. A decade ago, this editorial board helped lead the charge against the former TXU Corp.&#8217;s plan to build about a dozen coal-fired power plants in the state.</h3>
