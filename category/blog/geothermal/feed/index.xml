										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If we can perfect this method, who needs any other form of energy? Yes we should keep producing Solar, Wind and Local geothermal. But with Deep Geothermal the only horizons we would have to conquer to be carbon free would be water shipping and air transport. Maybe Deep Geo could even make electric water transport possible. This stuff is so cool.</p>

<h1 class="content-header__row content-header__hed">Want Unlimited Clean Energy? Just Drill the World&#8217;s Hottest Well</h1>
</div>
<div class="content-header__row content-header__accreditation">
<p class="content-header__row content-header__dek">An engineering team bored 2 miles into hot rock without causing major earthquakes—a good sign for harnessing the Earth&#8217;s heat as a power source.</p>
</div>
<p>There’s treasure buried deep beneath the viridescent foothills of Tuscany’s Apennine Mountains, where the stark metal trusses of the Venelle-2 drilling tower mark its location like an X on a map. This geothermal well reaches nearly two miles beneath the surface to a region where temperatures and pressures are so high that rock begins to bend. Here, conditions are ripe for supercritical geothermal fluids, mineral-rich water that exhibits characteristics of both a liquid and a gas. It’s not exactly gold, but if Venelle-2 could tap into a reservoir of supercritical fluids and use them to spin a turbine on the surface, it would be one of the most energy-dense forms of renewable power in the world.</p>
<p>But getting there isn’t so easy. Boring deep into the ground risks triggering an earthquake if a large chunk of rock slips out of place. This risk was amplified at the Venelle-2 well, which aimed to breach the K horizon, a poorly understood boundary between the hard rock near the surface and the more pliant rock below. What would happen when the drill punched through this layer into the supercritical fluids below was anyone’s guess.</p>
<div class="consumer-marketing-unit consumer-marketing-unit--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit--no-failsafe">
<div class="consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content"></div>
</div>
<p>And for now, the mystery remains. Drilling at Venelle-2 stopped just shy of the K horizon when temperatures at the bottom of the well overwhelmed the equipment. Sensors at the bottom of the well indicated temperatures had breached 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit and pressures 300 times greater than at the surface. Nevertheless, Venelle-2 is the hottest borehole ever created, and it demonstrated that it&#8217;s possible to drill at the extreme end of supercritical conditions. And this week, a <a class="external-link" href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019JB018618?af=R" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019JB018618?af=R&quot;}">paper</a> published in the <em>Journal of Geophysical Research</em> showed that it could be done without producing any major seismic activity.</p>
<div class="ad ad--in-content">
<div class="ad__slot ad__slot--in-content"></div>
</div>
<p>The authors say they hope their study will assuage fears that all geothermal drilling causes earthquakes. After all, the public usually hears about geothermal wells only when something goes wrong. But Venelle-2 shows that “there are also many positive cases of wells drilled for geothermal purposes,” says Riccardo Minetto, a researcher at the University of Geneva and coauthor of the study.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I agreed to publish this here because it is such a different perspective then the one I have or CES has. We tend to blame builders for not just serving up top notch energy efficient residences. Then there is the issue of retrofitting. As always this is no endorsement of Ryan or his Real Estate firm. Believe me I have no intention of buying a home in Alaska.</p>

There is still a long way to go before energy efficiency and reducing waste becomes the standard for new homes and improved existing homes, but a larger pool of buyers demanding these features can help move the needle bit by bit.</div>

They are Bankers to the world. They have no incentives what so ever. Yet here they are, for the good of the world. They deserve a postcard from the world that says, JOB WELL DONE!</p>

<div id="article-description">The Swiss voted on Sunday in favour of a massive overhaul of the country&#8217;s energy system by gradually replacing the power from its ageing nuclear reactors with renewable sources.</div>
<div id="article-body">
<div>A full 58.2 percent of Swiss voters supported the shift, according to a final tally after Sunday&#8217;s referendum, with only four of the country&#8217;s 26 cantons voting &#8220;no&#8221;.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;This is a historic day for the country,&#8221; Green Party parliamentarian Adele Thorens Goumaz told public broadcaster RTS.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;Switzerland will finally enter into the 21st century when it comes to energy.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The move has been in the making since shortly after Japan&#8217;s Fukushima nuclear plant was destroyed in the March 2011 tsunami disaster, when the Swiss government decided to gradually close its nuclear plants.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Instead, it aims to increase reliance on hydraulic power as well as renewables like solar, wind, geothermal and biomass.</div>

<h1>What&#8217;s New for Renewable Energy</h1>
<p>Energy drives social and economic development. In the past, the discovery of oil triggered an unprecedented industrial revolution that had significant impacts on our quality of life. A single litre of oil provides as many calories as two to twenty weeks of human labour, enough energy to fuel our growing industries, heat our homes, and get us from point A to point B quickly.</p>
<hr />
<p>However, with an alarming scarcity of fossil fuels and growing energy demands on the horizon, especially for emerging economies, the search for sustainable means of production is not only imperative for the preservation of the environment—it is also becoming highly lucrative. That is why renewable energy is receiving more and more attention from governments and businesses. There is talk of a new industrial revolution, one that is all about green energy.</p>
<p>Since the Kyoto Protocol, most countries have increased the proportion of their budget invested in energy with the potential for long-term sustainability. We can already see results; even in 2006, 18.6% of the world&#8217;s electricity came from renewable resources. Of that percentage, hydraulic energy (hydroelectric dams, underwater turbines, tidal power plants, etc.) constituted 89%, biomass constituted 5.7%, and wind power, geothermal energy, and solar power constituted 3.5%, 1.7%, and 0.2%, respectively.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;Rule No. 1: Never Lose Money. Rule No. 2: Never Forget Rule No. 1.&#8221;<br />
</em>&#8211;Warren Buffett</p>
<p>Warren Buffett is famous for both his legendary investing acumen, and his simple, straightforward investing advice. For years, alternative energy has been viewed as non-competitive with traditional energy production from coal and other fossil fuels, making them money-losers for most investors.</p>
<p>Buffett&#8217;s own <strong>Berkshire Hathaway </strong> (<span class="ticker">NYSE: <a class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001" href="http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/BRK-B.aspx?source=isssitthv0000001" data-id="206602">BRK-B</a></span> <a class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010" title="Add BRK-B to My Watchlist" href="http://my.fool.com/watchlist/add?ticker=BRK-B&amp;source=iwlsitbut0000010"> </a>) subsidiary MidAmerican Energy is heavily investing in alternative energy sources, including both wind and solar. And considering that MidAmerican produces more than $1.2 billion in annual &#8220;ammo&#8221; for Buffett&#8217;s &#8220;elephant gun,&#8221; the story on renewables is clearly changing.</p>
<p>Should investors follow the Oracle into &#8220;green energy&#8221; to make more greenbacks? Let&#8217;s take a look.</p>
<p>MidAmerican has been investing in wind energy for a decade, and is easily the largest producer of wind energy in North America; wind actually accounts for more than 30% of the company&#8217;s total energy generation capacity. Current projects will move the total to almost 40%.</p>
<p>MidAmerican has relied on both <strong>General Electric</strong>  (<span class="ticker">NYSE: <a class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001" href="http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/GE.aspx?source=isssitthv0000001" data-id="203664">GE</a></span> <a class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010" title="Add GE to My Watchlist" href="http://my.fool.com/watchlist/add?ticker=GE&amp;source=iwlsitbut0000010"> </a>) and <strong>Vestas </strong> (<span class="ticker">NASDAQOTH: <a class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001" href="http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/VWDRY.aspx?source=isssitthv0000001" data-id="221845">VWDRY</a></span> <a class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010" title="Add VWDRY to My Watchlist" href="http://my.fool.com/watchlist/add?ticker=VWDRY&amp;source=iwlsitbut0000010"> </a>) for wind turbines for different projects. A large project in California, which deployed more than 300 megawatts of power generating capacity, featured 100 Vestas wind turbines. GE&#8217;s turbines, on the other hand, are the most commonly used in MidAmerican&#8217;s fleet</p>

</div>
<p>(Reuters) &#8211; Renewable energy has created a &#8220;gold rush&#8221; atmosphere in Germany&#8217;s depressed north-east, giving the country&#8217;s poorhouse good jobs and great promise.</p>
<p>The natural resources attracting investors and industry are of a simple variety: wind, sunshine, agricultural products and farm waste such as liquid manure.</p>
<p><span id="articleText">The rush to tap green resources in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state is reminiscent of the frenzies that came with gold or oil discoveries in past centuries. The buzz can be felt in towns and sparkling new factories across the Baltic shore state.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Renewable energy has become extremely valuable for our state,&#8221; said its premier, Erwin Selling, in an interview with Reuters. &#8220;It&#8217;s just a great opportunity &#8212; producing renewable energy and creating manufacturing jobs.</p>
<p>&#8220;From an industrial point of view we&#8217;d been one of Germany&#8217;s weaker areas. But the country is abandoning nuclear power. That will work only if there&#8217;s a corresponding &#8212; and substantial &#8212; increase in renewables. It&#8217;ll be one of Germany&#8217;s most important sectors in the future. We want to be up there leading the way.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That is a very interesting question. At one level is is just a case of a bad attribution. It would be like saying if Jane&#8217;s stopped publication then there are no airplanes. At another level, as all the authors say that were involved, they may have just run out of new and bright things to say. It could also be that with many other things predicting the END OF THE WORLD, when it never happens, the readers got bored. That several major religions have preached that for thousands of years and nobody has gotten bored yet would speak against that. I have always been skeptical about the doom and gloom nature of the blog itself but when the CIA and the Defense Department believe something then, you have to believe it has some credibility and really oil is a finite resource. So with deep water drilling and fracking we may just be buying time. Then there is global warming. Anyway I drivel on.</p>

<h1><a title="Permanent Link to Our Clean Energy Future" href="http://peakenergy.blogspot.com.au/2013/08/our-clean-energy-future.html" rel="bookmark">Our Clean Energy Future</a></h1>
<p>Posted by Big Gav</p>
<p>Following on my recent post bidding <a href="http://peakenergy.blogspot.com.au/2013/08/a-farewell-to-oil-drum.html">Farewell to The Oil Drum</a>, I&#8217;d like to have a look at what I view as our longer term future for energy production and consumption.</p>
<p>As noted in my previous post, for the time being the combination of unconventional oil extraction and the ramping up of extraction of natural gas (from both conventional and unconventional sources) has continued to push the point of peak oil production out into the future, defying the predictions of the more pessimistic peak oil observers. During this period we have seen a boom in the research and development of solutions to help us eliminate our dependency on fossil fuels, which I&#8217;ll explore in this post.</p>
<p>Solutions can be divided into 3 groups :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Renewable energy &#8211; solar power, wind power, geothermal power, hydro power, ocean energy and biomass derived power (including biofuels)</li>
<li>Distribution of renewable energy &#8211; energy storage and the electricity grid</li>
<li>Adopting alternatives to oil and other fossil fuels &#8211; electric transport, bioplastic, alternatives to fossil fuel based fertiliser and new models for manufacturing, construction and agriculture</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Renewable Energy</h2>
<p>The graphic below shows the energy available from renewable energy sources annually compared to <a href="http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/ieo/index.cfm">global energy consumption</a>. The numbers are intended to give a rough idea of relative scale &#8211; for any given energy source a wide range of estimates can be found in the literature so the numbers are indicative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b5rwkIY79S4/Ug96fgMWYTI/AAAAAAAAAMk/VAKqFR60Smc/s1600/Slide1.png"><img decoding="async" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b5rwkIY79S4/Ug96fgMWYTI/AAAAAAAAAMk/VAKqFR60Smc/s400/Slide1.png" border="0" /></a></div>
<p>These numbers in some ways understate the amount of energy potentially available (ignoring solar power potential at sea or in <a href="http://ourcleanenergyfuture.blogspot.com/2009/04/space-based-solar-power.html">space</a>, for example, or wind power at <a href="http://peakenergy.blogspot.com/2008/01/alternative-wind-power-experiments.html">high altitudes</a> or <a href="http://ourcleanenergyfuture.blogspot.com/2008/12/floating-offshore-wind-power.html">far offshore</a>, or geothermal power <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=geothermal-power-plants-face-rocky-starts">deep below</a> the surface of the earth) but still serve the demonstrate that the renewable energy available to us is orders of magnitude larger than our current global energy consumption.</p>
<p>The contribution made by renewable energy to our energy needs is expected to <a href="http://www.iea.org/newsroomandevents/pressreleases/2013/june/name,39156,en.html">exceed that made by gas</a> (and double that made by nuclear power) by 2016, though progress needs to be <a href="http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/name,37023,en.html">accelerated</a> if we wish to create a sustainable energy system.</p>
<p><b>Solar power</b></p>
<p>Solar power is the largest energy source available to us, dwarfing all other sources &#8211; renewable and non-renewable. Approximately 36,000 Terawatts of power could be captured by land based solar power generation &#8211; compared to current global energy use of around 16 TW. As a result, most of the plans floated for shifting to <a href="http://www.go100percent.org/cms/">100% renewable</a> energy (examples include proposals by <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-path-to-sustainable-energy-by-2030">Mark Jacobson</a> and <a href="http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3540">Stuart Staniford</a> and local plans for countries like <a href="http://reneweconomy.com.au/2013/germany-100-renewable-energy-and-beyond-78310">Germany</a> and <a href="http://reneweconomy.com.au/2013/another-myth-busted-on-the-road-to-100-renewable-electricity-52178">Australia</a>) rely primarily on solar power.</p>
<p>Solar power is not only the largest energy source available to us but it is also the fastest growing energy source, with solar power generation increasing by <a href="http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/statistical-review-of-world-energy-2013/review-by-energy-type/renewable-energy.html">over 58%</a> in 2012.</p>
<p>There are a number of options for harnessing solar power &#8211; power generation using solar photovoltaic (PV) cells and solar thermal arrays along with <a href="http://www.theoildrum.com/tag/passive_solar_series">passive solar</a> techniques such as solar hot water heaters.</p>
<p>I have been of the view that <a href="http://peakenergy.blogspot.com.au/search/label/solar%20thermal%20power">solar thermal power</a> generation (also known as concentrating solar power or CSP) would become our most important source of power in the longer term. This view was based on a number of advantages that solar thermal possesses &#8211; it does not require rare or expensive materials (enabling it to scale without hitting resource limits), it can be built on (and is best suited to) arid land that has few other uses, it can incorporate energy storage (thus avoiding the intermittency issue), it is compatible with the existing centralised generation model and it can be combined with traditional sources of power generation (coal or gas) in hybrid power plants that allow an easy transition using existing connections to the electricity grid.</p>
<p>An area of desert around 250 km by 250 km covered with solar thermal power generation could supply all the world&#8217;s current electricity demand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I mean really if they are going to drop their insistence on solar panel installations as part of a retrofit then why keep the name? Are they now a software company or are they now a software and then install whatever company? Good questions with no answers. It would be like Tide if it were to stop making soap and started making dishwashers. Would they keep the name and why?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/a-peak-at-solarcitys-new-energy-efficiency-software?">http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/a-peak-at-solarcitys-new-energy-efficiency-software?</a></p>
<h1>Has SolarCity Created the Amazon 1-Click for Energy Efficiency?</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We believe SolarCity has the best database of residential energy use of anyone in the world.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Stephen Lacey: June 28, 2013</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After SolarCity shifted its energy efficiency strategy and pulled back from doing residential retrofits in-house, the solar services behemoth is moving straight into <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/intelligent-efficiency-innovations-reshaping-the-energy-efficiency-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intelligent efficiency</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GTM&#8217;s Eric Wesoff recently reported on SolarCity&#8217;s <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/SolarCity-Shifts-Its-Home-Efficiency-Strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolving</a> business plan and the <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Can-SolarCity-Scale-Energy-Efficiency-Services-Like-Solar-Roofs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resulting changes</a> that company executives say will scale residential efficiency in the same way solar services have <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/us-residential-solar-financing-to-reach-5.7-billion-by-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scaled residential solar</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But solar is very different from efficiency. For the most part, solar is very standardized and installations are uniform from home to home. Efficiency retrofits encompass an extraordinarily broad category of activities and skills. Incentives are also quite different for efficiency, making it more complicated from a financial perspective. That&#8217;s why <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/are-solar-companies-equipped-to-get-into-energy-efficiency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only a handful</a> of U.S. solar contractors have offered efficiency as an in-house service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SolarCity decided that doing the retrofit work itself was not the best way to scale. Instead, it has turned from manpower to the power of big data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The secret sauce is a &#8220;simulation engine&#8221; that shows homeowners exactly how much they&#8217;re spending on energy everywhere in their house. The initial database was created using information from 16,000 home energy audits performed over the last five years. It relies on an algorithm developed at the Department of Energy that crunches 100 million calculations per home for each individual energy efficiency audit (which is still performed by SolarCity when installing solar).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The simulation software looks at every component in a home in relation to one another,&#8221; said SolarCity COO Peter Rive. &#8220;Every ten minutes, it thinks about what one thing is doing and about its effect on the rest of the systems within the home.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Petersburg school nominated for solar energy program</h1>
<div class="byLine"><span>Dan Petrella</span> <span class="timestamp">06/18/2013 &#8211; 11:22 PM EDT</span></div>
<p>PETERSBURG — The PORTA School District could soon add more solar power to its alternative energy <a id="itxthook0" class="itxtnewhook itxthook" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; border: 0px none transparent; padding: 0px; background-color: transparent; background-image: none; display: inline;" href="http://business-news.thestreet.com/sj-r/story/petersburg-school-nominated-solar-energy-program/1#" rel="nofollow"><span id="itxthook0w" class="itxtrst itxtrstspan itxtnowrap itxtnewhookspan" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; text-decoration: underline ! important; border-width: 0px 0px 1px; border-style: none none solid; border-color: transparent transparent #00cc00; padding: 0px 0px 1px ! important; color: #009900; background-color: transparent;">portfolio</span></a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to a wind turbine, solar panels and geothermal heating installed in 2009 at PORTA High School, the district has been saving about $350,000 a year in energy costs, School Superintendent Matt Brue said.</p>
<p>Now, a former student who works for Joule Solar Energy in New Orleans has nominated PORTA Central School for a program that aims to bring solar panels to schools through crowdfunding</p>
<p>Oakland, Calif.-based Mosaic offers an online platform for individuals to <a id="itxthook1" class="itxtnewhook itxthook" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; font-style: normal; text-decoration: none; border: 0px none transparent; padding: 0px; background-color: transparent; background-image: none; display: inline;" href="http://business-news.thestreet.com/sj-r/story/petersburg-school-nominated-solar-energy-program/1#" rel="nofollow"><span id="itxthook1w" class="itxtrst itxtrstspan itxtnowrap itxtnewhookspan" style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%; text-decoration: underline ! important; border-width: 0px 0px 1px; border-style: none none solid; border-color: transparent transparent #00cc00; padding: 0px 0px 1px ! important; color: #009900; background-color: transparent;">invest</span></a> in solar projects.</p>
<p>When Bob O’Hara received an email from Mosaic saying that the company was looking for schools to work with, he thought of PORTA Central.</p>
<p>O’Hara, 29, attended PORTA schools through eighth grade before enrolling at Sacred Heart-Griffin High School in Springfield. He moved to New Orleans after graduating in 2002 to attend Tulane University, but he still visits his parents in Petersburg regularly.</p>
<p>He likes to check out the wind turbine at the high school on his visits and thought PORTA Central would be a good candidate for solar panels because of its long, south-facing roofline.</p>
<p>O’Hara said he also knows the district has been facing budget cuts due to dwindling state funding.</p>
<p>“One way to be able to invest in a school is to help them with their energy costs,” he said.</p>
