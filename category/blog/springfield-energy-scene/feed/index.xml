										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Springfield IL has always been opposed to renewable energy. It took a Friend of mine with a degree in Solar Power 20 years at CWLP to get the City to erect a modest Solar Farm. 700 panels, I think. There is no Wind Power because the county changed the zoning ordinances to make turbine placement unfeasible. There is modest geothermal. For homeowners, the City Council is always trying to tax smart meters to Solar more expensive. So why does it not surprise me that CWLP came up with  &#8220;program to prevent global warming&#8221; by continuing to burn tons of coal daily.</p>

<h1 class="gnt_ar_hl">CWLP could become world’s largest carbon capture research station</h1>
<div class="gnt_ar_by">Kade Heather Staff Writer</div>
<p>JUNE 4, 2020</p>
</article>
<p class="gnt_ar_b_p">City Water, Light &amp; Power is on path for constructing the world’s largest research and development pilot for a new carbon capture system.</p>
<p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The U.S. Department of Energy had about 30 responses from power plants across the country when it initially proposed the idea about three years ago. The DOE has narrowed it down to about five competitors – CWLP being one.</p>
<p class="gnt_ar_b_p">While CWLP is not guaranteed to host the pilot system, Kevin OBrien, director of the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center at the University of Illinois, and the principle investigator overseeing the project, said DOE is “very impressed by the team,” and by CWLP’s facility.</p>
<p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“They toured the plant, they feel it’s a very, very well-run plant and they’re impressed by that, and that’s an important factor when you’re competing for these types of projects. So there’s no guarantee, but we think we’ve got a really high probability of winning this one,” OBrien said.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and read. Then write letters to the Mayor and the City Council condeming the idea. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The original BAD idea behind this bill was that Excelon&#8217;s Nukes were not profitable so they needed a subsidy from the State of Illinois or they would have to shut down. That subsidy would come from including the Nukes as part of Illinois&#8217; Clean Energy Portfolio. Yah right, like Nukes are a clean source of energy. But this 2016 version rolls Clean Coal, Renewable Energy and Nuclear Power into the same package. Just how bad is this Bill? There is no such thing as Clean Coal.</p>

<div data-canvas-width="242.61333333333334"></div>
<div>Less than a week ago, Exelon&#8211; the owner of Illinois’ nuclear power industry and one of the largest energy companies in the world&#8211; introduced a new bill to the Illinois Senate. SB 1585 is disguised as a “new generation” energy plan for our state, but is nothing more than a giant bailout for Exelon.</div>
<div></div>
<div data-canvas-width="282.94000000000005">To make things worse, Exelon is using their energy monopoly to strongarm our lawmakers, threatening to close 2 nuclear power plants if the bill doesn’t pass by May 31st.  SB1585 takes tax dollars out of our</div>
<div>hands, and puts them straight into the pockets of Exelon.</div>
<div></div>
<div data-canvas-width="476.4799999999999">Our tax dollar should not be used to keep dangerous nuclear energy in business. Instead, our tax dollars should be invested in the clean energy future that our state and planet needs!</div>
<div data-canvas-width="476.4799999999999"></div>
<div data-canvas-width="430.21333333333337">BEAT BACK THE EXELON SHAKEDOWN!</div>

<h1>Wind power drives demand for new transmission lines</h1>

<blockquote><p>A second high-voltage transmission line — this one intended for power from Kansas wind turbines — is making its way toward central Illinois.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The Grain Belt Express power line would carry electricity from wind farms in western Kansas across central Missouri and Illinois to Indiana, following the same general corridor as the Illinois Rivers power line already announced by Ameren Transmission Co. of Illinois. Illinois Rivers also would carry wind-generated power west to east.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Kansas and Indiana utility regulators have approved the $2 billion Grain Belt project, <a href="http://www.grainbeltexpresscleanline.com/">www.grainbeltexpresscleanline.com</a>, and regulators in Missouri plan to hold public hearings this week. As with the Illinois Rivers project, the Grain Belt Express has generated controversy. Proponents argue for jobs and clean energy. Opponents fear falling land values and health hazards.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Illinois is expected to be the next regulatory stop for the 750-mile power line.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“We’re taking a state-by-state approach to our regulatory process,” said Adhar Johnson, project manager for Grain Belt Express.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got an email from Southern Illinois that said 30 big rigs had rolled through town yesterday morning. I figure that that is enough for 2 wells. It seems like some drilling company has decided to &#8220;go for it&#8221;. Which makes sick and disgusting sense. Many of the leases die at the end of April. I suspect that these will be test wells, because no one knows what is down there. It takes about  7 days to to drill a well and frack it. That would have the wells beginning to come in as the lease expires. This is what I said in print.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>FRACKING STINKS</strong></span></p>
<p>I am <a id="FALINK_2_0_1" href="http://www.illinoistimes.com/Springfield/article-11240-letters-to-the-editor-4_11_13.html#">writing</a> to argue for a moratorium against fracking in Illinois (SB 1418). Chicago environmentalists argue that “fracking is going to happen anyway.” That is a total capitulation to the industry. The bill that the environmentalists endorse (HB2615) is amazing in the things it does not prevent. It does not force the frackers to recycle their water, allows for methane flaring, allows wells within 300 feet of water sources, allows wells within 500 feet of a house, does not allow adequate testing of produced waters especially for radiation and then allows that waste to be deep well injected and finally allows for the state to overrule counties and municipalities who do not want fracking or more protective measures.</p>
<p>Many states have tried to establish hydraulic fracturing regulations that would allow the industry to drill safely. The problem is regulations do not work. The industry always violates the regulations and when caught pays the fine as part of standard operating procedure. These violations include injecting radioactive water underground, open pit storage of fracking and waste waters even where not permitted, the production of toxic fumes and the sickening of residents, well water contamination and the direct dumping of toxic water into springs and streams. They have gone so far as to sell toxic water to county townships to suppress dust in the summer and to de-ice roads in the winter as if that was safe. Homeowners are duped into selling mineral rights without being told that it will make their houses impossible to sell and wreck their mortgages. In Pennsylvania their violations include:</p>
<p>&#8211; 224 violations of “failure to properly store, transport, process or dispose of residual waste.”</p>
<p>&#8211; 143 violations of “discharge of pollutional material to the waters of Commonwealth.”</p>
<p>&#8211; 140 violations of “pit and tanks not constructed with sufficient capacity to contain pollutional substances.”</p>
<p>This does not include the actual damage that they do to the environment, like damaging the roads where they work, and flaring the natural gas that should be harnessed as a fuel source and the constant noise pollution that the above activities produce. I was visiting a friend in Colorado when such a well was put in and the noise and smell alone were enough to sicken me.</p>

They are with Roselawn Memorial Park and Butler Funeral home respectively. I am going to do Roselawn today and Butler tomorrow. I just love these guys. They had a woven basket casket with an optional silk liner with them on Saturday. But they have so many options it is real exciting. This is their Facebook page and their website:</p>

<h2><a title="Permanent Link to Are There Green Cemeteries in Illinois?" href="http://wakethememory.com/blog/are-there-green-cemeteries-in-illinois/" rel="bookmark"> Are There Green Cemeteries in Illinois?</a></h2>
<div>July 19th, 2010</div>
<p>I am happy to report that the answer is finally, <strong>YES</strong>!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Green Burial Council</em> in California recently approved Roselawn Memorial Park for green burials. You can now be buried in Illinois without a casket, without embalming, without anything but a shroud if you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not personally think that a green burial ground has to be approved by the Green Burial Council, but they have some strict standards that make sense, and their mission is great. In a previous life, I worked in the architectural world, and saw first-hand what it was like dealing with the logistics of becoming LEED certified, and know how hard it can be. Additionally, it is very expensive to become “Certified Organic”. I think it’s worthwhile to recognize any cemetery or burial product willing to become more natural, and I will support any company that tries to be better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is their information. They do not seem to have a working website yet. I will keep you posted and update after I contact them directly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know I said I was done with the residential housing market last Friday. I was talking to Bob Croteau about which side of the insulation the vapor barrier should be on if you are insulating the upper portion of your  basement and he mentioned this in passing. By the way the answer is the vapor barrier should be on the basement side of the insulation and he suggested  only insulating 4 feet of the basement from the top of the basement wall down. After that you are pretty much wasting your time. On to the solar rebate. The reason I said to hurry and get it if you were thinking about solar it is because it is on a first come first serve basis.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cwlp.com/energy_services/ESO_services_programs/solar_reb.htm">http://www.cwlp.com/energy_services/ESO_services_programs/solar_reb.htm</a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">SOLAR REWARDS Rebate</span></p>
<p>CWLP&#8217;s SOLAR REWARDS program offers rebates of up to $15,000 per household or business to CWLP electric customers who install solar electric—also known as photovoltaic (PV)—systems at their residential or commercial facilities. To qualify for participation in the program, customers must meet all eligibility criteria, including being pre-approved prior to purchasing any equipment or starting any work.</p>
<p>The SOLAR REWARDS rebate program is being offered on a first-come/first-served basis until funds budgeted for the program are exhausted. The rebate is calculated at $1,500 per kilowatt (kW) of system capacity. Qualifying systems can range from a minimum of 0.5 kW to a maximum of 25 kW. Rebates will be provided in the form of a CWLP bill credit. For rebates exceeding $1,000, applicants may request their rebate payment in the form of a check, but must provide CWLP with their social security number or FEIN number. Customers have 90 days from the date of their pre-approved application to complete their PV system installation and submit their post-installation documentation to CWLP. Failing to either meet this deadline or receive a deadline extension from CWLP will result in the loss of rebate eligibility.</p>
<p>To apply to participate in the SOLAR REWARDS Rebate Program, use the Pre-Approval Application in the <a href="http://www.cwlp.com/online_services/SolarPacket.pdf">online SOLAR REWARDS Application Packet</a>. To request a hard copy of the Packet, contact the CWLP Energy Services Office by phone at 789-2070 or by <a href="mailto:nrgxprts@cwlp.com?subject=request%20for%20SOLAR%20REWARDS%20Packet"> email</a>.</p>
<p>Photovoltaic systems convert energy from the sun into electricity using panels that are installed to take maximum benefit of available sunlight. Some systems are even designed to allow the panels to &#8220;track&#8221; the sun throughout the day. The lifespan of a typical PV panel is approximately 25 years.</p>
<p>Using solar energy can help homeowners and businesses reduce consumption of fossil fuels and lower their monthly energy bills by reducing the amount of electricity purchased from CWLP.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You wonder why I go on about all the things you can do in your house to save power. Well the following article tells the whole story. As I said this a joke and the joke is on you. They will never get to the &#8220;smart&#8221; meters and once they do, so what. Then all you become is a part of the utilities load flattening program. Big whoop. Who wants to do laundry at 2 o&#8217;clock in the morning. Nice piece of writing though.<a href="http://www.illinoistimes.com/Springfield/article-9550-ameren-illinois-launches-10-year-modernization-plan.html"><br />

<h1>Ameren Illinois launches  10-year modernization plan</h1>
<h2>Proposed new rates could mean a decrease for some customers</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.illinoistimes.com/Springfield/articles.by.Author-545.html">By Neil Schneider</a></p>
<p>Ameren Illinois, a subsidiary of Ameren Corporation, took its first step  in implementing its Modernization Action Plan (MAP) on Tuesday, Jan.3.  The plan will provide customers with a more reliable and modernized  electric distribution system.</p>
<p>In a press release, Ameren said  that over the next decade an additional $625 million will be invested in  updating the Ameren Illinois electric delivery system, while also  creating 450 new jobs during the program’s peak year. Ameren Illinois  serves 20,767 customers in Sangamon County.</p>
<p>“Today’s filing with  the Illinois Commerce Commission marks the beginning of an initiative  that will enable Ameren Illinois to modernize its electric distribution  system over the next 10 years in order to meet the service expectations  of our customers in the 21st century,” said Craig Nelson, senior vice  president of Ameren Illinois.</p>
<p>The filing includes the deployment  of about 750,000 automated “smart” meters, greater use of advanced  distribution system automation, the modernization and expansion of  electric substations and the installation of new transformers.</p>
<p>Smart  meters allow consumers and utility companies to monitor electricity  more closely during the day through the usage of wireless transmitters,  while also allowing a utility company to “talk” to the meters and adjust  power usage and distribution throughout the day.</p>
<p>Ameren  spokesman Leigh Morris said that a major advantage of the “smart” meters  is Ameren customers will be able to take advantage of a “time-of-use  service.”</p>
<p>Morris said that there is the potential, for people who choose to use the “time-of-use service” to save money.</p>
<p>“Customers  can choose to buy electricity at a certain time of the day, at the  certain price it is offered at during that time,” Morris said. “You can  imagine that electricity is typically going to cost more at three in the  afternoon than at seven in the morning. Like anything else, it is about  supply and demand.”</p>

<p>Go there and read. More next week.</p>

<div title="2011-11-18T06:45:37Z">Last update Nov 18, 2011 @ 06:45 AM</div>
<p><a href="http://www.llcc.edu/">Lincoln Land Community College</a> expects to begin training about two dozen students for “green” jobs   early next year through two pilot programs made possible by $600,000 in  federal training grants.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.llcc.edu/workforce/WorkforceDevelopment/HireEducation/RenewableEnergyAcademy/tabid/6635/Default.aspx">Renewable Energy Academy</a> and the <a href="http://www.llcc.edu/WorkforceDevelopment/HireEducation/GreenConstructionAcademy/tabid/6333/Default.aspx">Green Construction Academy</a> will provide intensive training — classes are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday  through Thursday — for jobs in renewable energy and energy-efficient  building.</p>
<p>“We are looking at a lot of new skills and jobs that have not been  there in the past,” Julie Rourke, LLCC director of workforce  development, said Thursday.</p>
<p>The renewable-energy classes are scheduled to begin Jan. 9 and the  classes in green construction on Feb. 13. Both continue into mid-June.</p>
<p>Rourke said the school hopes to enroll 15 students in renewable energy  and 12 in green construction. There will be no cost to the first group  of students, because the federal grants are paying for the expense of  setting up the program, including equipment.</p>
<p>But she said the four-days-a-week schedule will take a strong commitment.</p>
<p>“It’s set up that way for a reason. One is the grant period,” said  Rourke. “The other is that we expect a lot of non-traditional students  who may be transitioning from one career to another, and there’s an  urgency to get them back in the work force.”</p>
<p>The grants, $350,000 from the U.S. Department of Education and $250,000  from the U.S. Department of Labor, were awarded through the LLCC HIRE  Education program. The goal is to make the classes self-sustaining once  the grants expire at the end of 2012.</p>
<p>LLCC Green Center manager Julie Bates said classes will cover a variety  of renewable-energy and energy-efficiency skills, including solar,  small wind systems, geothermal, green construction, plumbing and  heating, landscaping and site planning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Man the State Fair was kinda disappointing for me this year, at least from an energy perspective. Now I admit that the first year I started posting here was a pretty heady year. IDE had 2 booths for energy conservation. One was for seniors and one for the general public. Conservation World was packed. The Sierra Club had a tent with CWLP complete witha solar exhibit and a hybrid car. There were doors and windows guys galore in the Exhibition Hall, and even a guy selling wind turbines. The AG Equipment section even had an exhibit about biofuels. This year there was nada until I stopped at the &#8220;don&#8217;t mess with powerlines&#8221; guys tent (sorry &#8211; Live Line Demos) and saw the Wall Of Efficiencies display that was sharing space with him. Here is my picture.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/106_45011.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3184" title="106_4501" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/106_45011-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="682" /></a></p>
<p>That is Aaron Ridenour of PPI. According to him, they originally got the Wall to take to there members Board Members meeting but since then it has been to North Dakota, Kansas and Washington DC. They were actually in a Senate Hearing concerning a Coops Bill.</p>
<p>Here is what they say about it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ppi.coop/environmental/energy-efficiency/">http://www.ppi.coop/environmental/energy-efficiency/</a></p>
<p>tilized by PPI and its member cooperatives over the past few years. The sixteen foot <strong><em>“Energy Efficiency Walls”</em></strong> illustrate various opportunities for air infiltration or leakage within  the common home due to poor construction practices and materials. The  displays address: <strong><em>energy efficient construction practices and materials, and energy efficient equipment and technologies.</em></strong> The proper use of caulking around penetration points in the home’s  external walls, such as window and door openings, gas, water, AC and  heating system fuel lines and ventilation systems, and the selection and  installation of energy efficient insulation materials, ventilation  equipment and lighting systems are just a few of the energy efficient  items illustrated in the Walls. Utilizing the displays at member  cooperatives’ annual membership meetings, NRECA and Touchstone Energy  regional events, community college workshops and educational classes, …  homebuilder shows, county fairs, legislative briefings in Washington DC  to promote energy efficiency loan programs and other events, … over  400,000 consumers have been exposed to the educational opportunities of  the Energy Efficiency Walls since 2009.</p>

<p>More tomorrow.</p>
