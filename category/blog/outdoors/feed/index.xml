										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This should have happened 10 years ago on every shoreline in America. Let me be clear. Not every spot off the coast is eligible for wind turbines. And I believe that factors like scenery and inhabitant acceptance are factors to be weighed with as much importance as wind force and need, none the less these evaluations need to be done and done quickly. Long overdue aside, they need to get moving. The man makes a very good point, that the oil and gas business prepared a workforce for this.</p>

<p>This week, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), federal lead agency for offshore wind, is holding the inaugural meeting of the Gulf of Mexico Intergovernmental Renewable Energy Task Force. Although the task force is composed of elected officials from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, it was Louisiana, under the leadership of Gov. John Bel Edwards, who launched the process for the establishment of this regional Task Force — thereby paving the way for the exploration of offshore wind</p>
<p>This is because we can capitalize on wind energy in two related but distinct ways: first, from the manufacturing and servicing of offshore wind structures along the Atlantic coast; and then, from the eventual deployment of offshore wind structures in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Many of the assets and skills from Louisiana’s decades as a hub for offshore oil and gas exploration and production translate directly into offshore wind. These include our large port infrastructure; structural manufacturing expertise; world-class engineering; world-class vessel building; extensive offshore marine services; and an unbeatable workforce.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the story of a man named Boswell and Boswell had a very lovely wife (Sorry Brady Bunch) who turned the San Joaquin Valley from a lush river and lake wildlife area into the nation&#8217;s bread basket. Also how it destroyed a massive habitat This was and is a despicable enterprise. Sort of on the order of a Nuclear Testing site in the desert. Or a Copper Mine for that matter. If you want to hear a video about it. There is This:</p>

<h2 class="wsite-content-title">Hydrologic History of the Tulare Basin</h2>
<div></div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Tulare Basin historically supported an amazing complex of wetland habitats, unique in the world. This largely flat and arid region served as the floodplain for water flowing west from the southern Sierra Nevada, north from the Transverse Ranges, as well as from small intermittent arroyos flowing east from the Coast Ranges. Oak woodlands and riparian forests formed green corridors across the broad prairie on the eastern edge of the Tulare Basin. Freshwater tule marshes and alkaline wetlands adorned the slow-moving sloughs and shallow margins of Kern, Buena Vista, Goose, Tulare, and Summit lakes. Emergent marsh vegetation, such as tules and cattails, grew in permanent standing water at the shallow edges of freshwater wetlands. Upslope from the marshes, water intermittently flooded iodine bush scrub and alkali grassland habitats.</p>
<p>This highly-productive, shallow water system supported abundant populations of endemic lake-adapted fishes such that American white pelicans (Pelacanus erythrorhynchos) nested by the thousands on islands in Tulare Lake and Buena Vista Lake. The Tulare Basin&#8217;s extensive wetland habitats historically attracted significant numbers of resident and migratory waterbirds, including grebes, pelicans, cormorants, herons, egrets, ibises, geese, swans, ducks, rails, sandhill cranes, plovers, stilts, avocets, sandpipers, phalaropes, gulls, and terns.</p>
<p>The conversion of this water system to a lake-and-slough wetland to agriculture began in the mid-1800s when European settlers began to build canals and diversion structures to irrigate their crops.  This early irrigation infrastructure upstream from Tulare Lake slowly cut off the lake from its source waters, shrinking the lake&#8217;s footprint.  By 1899 &#8211; less than 50 years after irrigation was initiated &#8211; Tulare Lake went dry for the first time in history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It seems really weird that we all started out on bikes after horses and before cars were really affordable. There was a real love affair with bikes in the modern urban environment around the 1900s. Especially women who had never been allowed to get about. Bikes came on strong before mores or laws could be erected (so to speak) and women just went bonkers. Now every envirofreak (no offense intended) wants to go back to them. We shall see. We shall see.</p>

<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">Not that Mr. Würzner, the mayor of Heidelberg, is against electric cars. The postcard-perfect city, in southern Germany, gives residents who buy a battery-powered vehicle a bonus of up to 1,000 euros, or $1,200. They get another €1,000 if they install a charging station.</p>
<p class="css-axufdj evys1bk0">But electric cars are low on the list of tools that Mr. Würzner is using to try to cut Heidelberg’s impact on the climate, an effort that has given the city, home to Germany’s oldest university and an 800-year-old castle ruin, a reputation as a pioneer in environmentally conscious urban planning.</p>

The people of that planet, as a whole, didn’t take much notice — distracted by the pandemic and trained, both by the accumulating toll of recent disasters and the ever-rising volume of climate alarm, to see what might once have looked like brutal ruptures in lived reality instead as logical developments in a known pattern. Our time has been so stuffed with disasters that it was hard to see the arrival of perhaps the unlikeliest prophecy of all: that the plague year may have marked, for climate change, a turning point, and for the better.</p>

A turning point isn’t an endgame, or a victory, or a cessation of the need to struggle — for speedier decarbonization, for a sturdier future, for climate justice. Already, a future without profound climate suffering has been almost certainly foreclosed by decades of inaction, which means the burden of managing those impacts equitably will be handed down, generation to generation, into an indefinite and contested climate future.</p>

<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">&#8220;We’re attached to an ice floe now,” he said on the phone from a research vessel called the Polarstern, which is currently at the latitude 88 degrees north, just under 150 miles (230 kilometers) from the North Pole. “We’re drifting with the ice. Wherever it goes, we go.”</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY">Spreen, a sea ice and remote sensing scientist at the University of Bremen, is taking part in a research expedition known as the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate, or MOSAiC.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I say the same thing I have said about recycling all along. Store what you can&#8217;t recycle right now and recycle what you can now. The best examples is the large Wind Generator Blades (it used to be common batteries). Throwing stuff in the land fill that has no business there messes everything else up. So storing the Blades from the Wind Generators (turbines whatever) in one place&#8230;even if you bury them is critical, so that when you find a way to recycle them (and you will) you can go get them. Throwing common batteries in a land fill ( AAs, AAAs, etc) is essentially admitting you will never get them back. Better to store them in abandoned warehouses or something. Even burying them in a battery land fill so you can get them back is better than just throwing them away.</p>

<p>Solar panels are an increasingly important source of renewable power that will play an essential role in fighting climate change. They are also complex pieces of technology that become big, bulky sheets of electronic waste at the end of their lives—and right now, most of the world doesn’t have a plan for dealing with that.</p>
<p>But we’ll need to develop one soon, because the solar e-waste glut is coming. By 2050, the <a class="external-link" href="https://www.irena.org/documentdownloads/publications/irena_ieapvps_end-of-life_solar_pv_panels_2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.irena.org/documentdownloads/publications/irena_ieapvps_end-of-life_solar_pv_panels_2016.pdf&quot;}">International Renewable Energy Agency</a> projects that up to 78 million metric tons of solar panels will have reached the end of their life, and that the world will be generating about 6 million metric tons of new solar e-waste annually. While the latter number is a small fraction of the <a class="external-link" href="http://ewastemonitor.info/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;http://ewastemonitor.info/&quot;}">total e-waste humanity produces</a> each year, standard electronics recycling methods don’t cut it for solar panels. Recovering the most valuable materials from one, including silver and silicon, requires bespoke recycling solutions. And if we fail to develop those solutions along with policies that support their widespread adoption, we already know what will happen.</p>
<p>“If we don’t mandate recycling, many of the modules will go to landfill,” said Arizona State University solar researcher Meng Tao, who recently authored a <a class="external-link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pip.3316" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pip.3316&quot;}">review paper</a> on recycling silicon solar panels, which comprise <a class="external-link" href="https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/ise/de/documents/publications/studies/Photovoltaics-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/ise/de/documents/publications/studies/Photovoltaics-Report.pdf&quot;}">95 percent</a> of the solar market.</p>
<p>Solar panels are composed of photovoltaic (PV) cells that convert sunlight to electricity. When these panels enter landfills, valuable resources go to waste. And because solar panels contain toxic materials like lead that <a class="external-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342671383_Metal_dissolution_from_end-of-life_solar_photovoltaics_in_real_landfill_leachate_versus_synthetic_solutions_One-year_study" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342671383_Metal_dissolution_from_end-of-life_solar_photovoltaics_in_real_landfill_leachate_versus_synthetic_solutions_One-year_study&quot;}">can leach out</a> as they break down, landfilling also creates new environmental hazards.</p>

<p>Go there and read. Demand that your municipality pass a law that solar panels do not go in the land fill. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little house for me is 800 square feet. That&#8217;s what my wife and I have if you discount the storage space and the plant room in the basement. During the spring, summer, and fall months, we spend a lot of time outdoors in are yard or up until March doing other things in other spaces. Whether its an apartment or a rental house, that&#8217;s pretty much the way I have always been. Whether there were one of me or two of us.</p>
<p>The idea that small is better has always seemed to be suspect to me. Anyway, here is one take on the down side of a Tiny House. And yes, I still believe Small is Beautiful.</p>

<p class="body">Tiny houses are everywhere. They’ve received heavy <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2018/04/03/small-but-not-tiny-homes/484295002/">coverage</a> in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jun/26/tiny-home-communities-housing-solution-or-gentrified-trailer-parks">the media</a> and there are <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tinyhousemovement/?hl=en">millions</a> of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tinyhouse/?hl=en">followers</a> on dozens of pages on social media. While there is no census for these homes, they have seen a surge in popularity in the decade since the Great Recession – witness the <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/article/tiny-house-maker-legacy-housing-sets-terms-for-41-million-ipo-cm1063239">prolific growth</a> of tiny house manufacturers, for instance. Originating in the US, tiny homes have also been popping up across Canada, Australia and <a href="http://www.tinyhouseuk.co.uk/">the UK</a>.</p>
<p class="body">Tiny houses are promoted as <a href="https://theconversation.com/tiny-houses-the-big-idea-that-could-take-some-heat-out-of-the-housing-crisis-77295">an answer</a> to the affordable housing crisis; a desirable alternative to traditional homes and mortgages. Yet there are many complexities and contradictions that surround these tiny spaces, as I discovered when I began investigating them.</p>
<p class="body">I have toured homes, attended tiny house festivals, stayed in a tiny house community and interviewed several dozen people who live inside them. My research took me throughout the US, from a converted accessory unit squeezed between two average size homes on Staten Island to a community in Florida full of cute and brightly coloured tiny structures – appropriately located just down the road from Disney World. Here are three things I unexpectedly discovered along the way.</p>

<p>I am sure there are thousands of people that are happy with their Tiny Houses. Go there and read. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chernobyl and Fukushima released a lot of radiation. People died from the severe radiation released just after the accident, but &#8220;mild&#8221; consistent radiation is not dangerous to animals though it may have mild effects on adults and bigger effects on children. But the idea that a major radiation release would create one eyed giant humans or fire breathing dragons like wadzzilla is really remote. The fear of radiation has done some pretty amazing things for the environment, however.</p>

<h2 class="dbjv4gk">Researchers thought the site of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster was unable to support life. But a bunch of wolves, deer, wild boars, bears, and foxes disagree.</h2>

Once thought to be forever uninhabitable, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has become a haven for flora and fauna that prove that life, as they say in <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/49904/20-things-you-might-not-have-known-about-jurassic-park" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Jurassic Park</em></a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/oijEsqT2QKQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finds a way</a>.</p>
<h2 class="body title">1. The Animals of Chernobyl Survived Against All Odds</h2>
<p class="body">The effects of the radioactive explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on April 26, 1986 devastated the environment. Around the plant and in the nearby city of Pripyat in Ukraine, the Chernobyl disaster’s radiation caused the leaves of thousands of trees to turn a rust color, giving a new name to the surrounding woods—the <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/56235-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-33-years-later-wildlife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Forest</a>. Workers eventually bulldozed and buried the radioactive trees. Squads of Soviet conscripts also were ordered to <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-happened-to-the-dogs-of-chernobyl-the-harrowing-events-of-the-tv-series-are-sadly-true-17928470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoot</a> any stray animals within the 1000-square-mile Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Though experts today believe parts of the zone will remain unsafe for humans for another <a href="https://www.livescience.com/39961-chernobyl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20,000 years</a>, numerous animal and plant species not only survived, but thrived.</p>
<h2 class="body title">2. Bears and Wolves Outnumber Humans Around the Chernobyl Disaster Site</h2>
<p class="body">While humans are strictly prohibited from living in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, many other species have settled there. Brown bears, wolves, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/33677/canada-lynx-ghost-cat-north" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">lynx</a>, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59248/whats-difference-between-bison-and-buffalo" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">bison</a>, deer, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59461/10-gigantic-facts-about-moose" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">moose</a>, beavers, foxes, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64760/10-resourceful-facts-about-badgers" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">badgers</a>, wild boar, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/70797/12-surprising-facts-about-raccoon-dogs" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">raccoon dogs</a>, and more than 200 species of birds have formed their own ecosystem within the Chernobyl disaster area. Along with the larger animals, a variety of amphibians, fish, worms, and bacteria makes the unpopulated environment their home.</p>
