										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Especially if you listen to the Bernie Sanders supporters. (I also must quickly add that as a nonprofit organization CES doesn&#8217;t endorse any political candidates, just their energy policies) Her opponents say that she is for Fracking. I see no evidence of that. They say she is a Wall Street sellout. Compared to the rest of the field, I do not see that either. But here is what I do see.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixAGZZK_XbM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixAGZZK_XbM</a>kinda doesn&#8217;t matter at this point:</p>

<p>But then:</p>
<h1>Climate change: Alaska Gov.</h1>
<p>Sarah Palin acknowledges global warming is affecting her state</p>
<h2>But the former GOP vice presidential</h2>
<p>candidate contends gas drilling will help curb rising temperatures</p>
<dl class="byline"><span class="story-byline">By Kim Murphy </span><span>|</span><span class="story-titleline">Tribune Newspapers</span><span class="story-dateline"> </p>
<dd> April 15, 2009</dd>
<p> </span></dl>
<p>ANCHORAGE — <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/us/alaska-PLGEO100101400000000.topic" class="taxInlineTagLink" title="Alaska" id="PLGEO100101400000000">Alaska</a> <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics/government/sarah-palin-PEPLT0007504.topic" class="taxInlineTagLink" title="Sarah Palin" id="PEPLT0007504">Gov. Sarah Palin</a> acknowledged Tuesday that global warming is harming her state but said stepped-up natural-gas production could mitigate its effects.</p>
<p>Palin spoke at a hearing before Interior Secretary <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics/government/ken-salazar-PEPLT000007548.topic" class="taxInlineTagLink" title="Ken Salazar" id="PEPLT000007548">Ken Salazar</a> — the third of a series he is holding across the country to consider renewed oil and gas leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf.</p>
<p>The 2008 Republican nominee for vice president said relatively clean-burning natural gas can supplant dirtier fuels and slow the discharge of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>&#8220;We Alaskans are living with the changes that you are observing in Washington,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The dramatic decreases in the extent of summer sea ice, increased coastal erosion, melting of permafrost, decrease in alpine glaciers and overall ecosystem changes are very real to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the past, Palin has questioned the science behind predictions of sea ice loss.</p>
<p>But at Tuesday&#8217;s hearing, she made it clear that she recognizes the problem of global warming and cast energy development as part of the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stopping domestic energy production of preferred fuels does not solve the issues associated with global warming and threatened or endangered species, but it can make them worse,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Palin acknowledged that &#8220;many believe&#8221; a global effort to reduce greenhouse gases is needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meeting these goals will require a dramatic increase, in the very near term, to preferred available fuels—including natural gas—that have a very low carbon footprint,&#8221; she said. &#8220;These available fuels are required to supply the nation&#8217;s energy needs during the transition to green energy alternatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>The federal Minerals Management Service estimates that Alaska&#8217;s offshore basins could hold 27 billion barrels of oil and 132 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Drill baby Drill. Sustainability, not so much.</p>
<p>As this blogger points out Sarah is always kinda vague about everything. No one can figure out whether that is symptomatic of a vague mind or a generalist&#8217;s over intelligence:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://topics.latimes.com/politics/people/sarah-palin" target="_" ref="http://topics.latimes.com/politics/people/sarah-palin" rel="noopener">Sarah Palin</a></strong> clearly was in her comfort zone when she chatted on-air Tuesday with conservative talk show host <strong>Hugh Hewitt</strong>. <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/09/sarah-palin-v-4.html" target="blank" rel="noopener">As The Ticket noted</a> , she presented a persona and offered some lines that could serve her well in her Thursday debate with <strong><a href="http://topics.latimes.com/politics/people/joe-biden" target="_" ref="http://topics.latimes.com/politics/people/joe-biden" rel="noopener">Joe Biden</a></strong>.<a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/10/01/sarah.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=430,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/images/2008/10/01/sarah.jpg" title="Sarah Palin takes the stage in Ohio" alt="Sarah Palin takes the stage in Ohio" style="margin: 9px 5px 5px 9px; float: right" border="0" height="201" width="300" /></a></p>
<p>Tuesday also saw the broadcast of another of her several interviews with <strong>Katie Couric</strong> of CBS.</p>
<p>This segment may not spark more <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/09/sarah-palin-mus.html" target="_" rel="noopener">calls from conservative commentators</a> that Palin give up her spot on the Republican national ticket. But in front of the television cameras &#8212; and in the face of more pointed questioning &#8212; the self-assurance that marked her conversation with Hewitt continued to elude her.</p>
<p>One answer by Palin will do little to quell concerns about her position on global  warming. As she did with <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/09/sarah-palin-on.html" target="_" rel="noopener">ABC&#8217;s Charlie Gibson a few weeks back</a>, she did her best to skirt a direct answer on its causes.</p>
<p>From the transcript:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Couric: What’s your position on global warming? Do you believe it’s man-made or not?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Palin: Well, we’re the only Arctic state, of course, Alaska. So we feel the impacts more than any other state, up there with the changes in climates. And certainly, it is apparent. We have erosion issues. And we have melting sea ice, of course. So, what I’ve done up there is form a sub-cabinet to focus solely on climate change. Understanding that it is real. And …</p>
<p dir="ltr">Couric: Is it man-made, though in your view?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Palin: You know there are &#8212; there are man’s activities that can be contributed to the issues that we’re dealing with now, these impacts. I’m not going to solely blame all of man’s activities on changes in climate. Because the world’s weather patterns are cyclical. And over history we have seen change there. But kind of doesn’t matter at this point, as we debate what caused it. The point is: it’s real; we need to do something about it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Pardon us for asking, but would it not be difficult to devise an effective policy to mitigate the effects of global warming without a firm grasp on what caused it?</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>I am voting vague mind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People protesting in great numbers or with great effect comes and goes. There are 2 types of &#8220;marching in the street&#8221;. There is Cause Marching and there is Purpose Marching. These types of protests can draw people from all over the country and draw hundreds of thousands of people; or they can consist of 25 people and Al Sharpton Marching in front of the New York Times building. Sometimes those protests can escalate to riots. Most notably the Civil War Veteran&#8217;s protest that rankled Grant&#8217;s first Term in office and the Hay Market incident in Chicago. The Poverty March on Washington led by Martin Luther King was a more peaceful example. But the March Against Climate Change was not going to be one of those.</p>
<p>You could tell by the lack of activity on the internet and the preposterous claims by the organizers, that this was pretty much going to be a dud. I mean does no one think rationally about these things. The organizers thought that 10,000 people would come to DC and protest in early March? In the dead of winter? Maybe on a nice spring day but&#8230;.So maybe 10,000 people came to the PowerShift09 Conference but didn&#8217;t want to freeze there butts off or maybe the conference was a bust too. Who knows? Nobody is really saying. But from the pictures and everyone&#8217;s estimates  about 2,500 people showed up in the SNOW&#8230;What?  Don&#8217;t they get the Weather Channel? All that having been said, here is how the regular media guys saw it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882700,00.html"> http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882700,00.html</a></p>

<h1>Despite Snow — and Irony —</h1>
<p>a Climate Protest Persists</p>
<p>By <span class="name"><a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="javascript:window.open('/time/letters/email_letter.html','letter','width=400,height=420,status=no,scrollbars=yes')">Bryan Walsh / Washington</a></span></p>
<p>The call rang out through Washington early on the morning of March 2: the biggest act of civil disobedience against global warming in American history would not, in fact, be snowed out.</p>
<p>Environmental groups, led by Greenpeace and the Rainforest Action Network, had enlisted eco-celebrities such as Robert Kennedy Jr. and Bill McKibben and registered more than 2,000 youth protesters from around the country for a march on the coal-fired Capitol Power Plant, which supplies steam and cooled water to Congress. They planned to shut down the plant by peacefully blocking the entrances, a textbook act of civil disobedience for which many expected — perhaps eagerly — to be arrested. The message was simple: the burning of coal, which accounts for some 40% of U.S. carbon emissions, &#8220;is destroying the planet through global warming,&#8221; as Kennedy put it. America needs to get off coal, which supplies nearly half the country&#8217;s electricity, if it wants to have any hope of controlling its greenhouse gas emissions, and it should start with the Capitol plant. (<a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/2008/top10/article/0,30583,1855948_1863706,00.html" target="_new" rel="noopener">See the top 10 green ideas of 2008.</a>)</p>
<p>As it turned out, the action may have been almost too successful. On Feb. 26, just a few days before the protest, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate majority leader Harry Reid called for the 103-year-old plant to switch from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas, a move long pushed for by environmentalists but blocked by representatives from coal-heavy states. Protesters claimed an early victory. &#8220;Getting the plant to switch shows the power of popular pressure,&#8221; said Steven Biel, the director of Greenpeace&#8217;s global-warming campaign. But there was no doubt that by responding before the protesters hit the streets of the capital, Congress was simply moving one set of goalposts off the field.</p>

<p>This is how the organizers saw it. Please note that they only list three media sources. I call that a &#8220;big whup&#8221;</p>

<h2>UNPRECEDENTED PROTEST</h2>
<p>March 3rd, 2009 <!-- by Robin --></p>
<p>Yesterday thousands of people came together to offer an unprecedented example of mass protest and civil disobedience for the climate.</p>
<p>More than 2500 activists, many willing to risk arrest, successfully blockaded all five entrances to the Capitol Power Plant for more than four hours.</p>
<p>As impressive as that is, this action wasn’t just about this one coal-fired powerplant. The scale and the commitment of the participants was the biggest example yet of the kind of public support necessary to solve the climate crisis.</p>
<p>We aren’t going to stop global warming by just changing lightbulbs and driving hybrid cars. The only real solution is to come together and demand unprecedented change through unprecedented action.</p>
<p>And that’s exactly what happened yesterday.</p>
<p>Take a look at the media coverage of the action:</p>

<h2>Victory: this is how to stop global warming</h2>
<p>March 2nd, 2009 <!-- by Robin --></p>
<p>More amazing images from the largest mass civil disobedience for the climate in U.S. history where thousands of activists shut down the Capitol Power Plant. The only way we’re going to solve the climate crisis is by coming together and taking action. Like this:</p>

<p>Either way it looks sooooo cold. The only way to get warm was to go back to your hotel room and suck power.</p>
<p>&#8220;God has a sense of humor,&#8221; said protester Rhody Streeter, of Louisville, Ky., referring to the weather.</p>

<h3><center> Government should invest in clean energy &amp; green jobs </center></h3>
<p>Q: What would you do for the environment?OBAMA: It is critical that we understand this is not just a challenge, it?s an opportunity, because if we create a new energy economy, we can create five million new jobs, easily. It can be an engine that drives us into the future the same way the computer was the engine for economic growth over the last couple of decades. We can do it, but we?re going to have to make an investment. The same way the computer was originally invented by a bunch of government scientists who were trying to figure out, for defense purposes, how to communicate, we?ve got to understand that this is a national security issue, as well.</p>
<p>McCAIN: We can move forward, and clean up our climate, and develop green technologies, and alternative energies for battery-powered cars, so that we can clean up our environment and at the same time get our economy going by creating millions of jobs.</p>

<h3><center> Willing to suspend ethanol subsidy to keep food prices down </center></h3>
<p>Q: Ethanol usage in gas is criticized for raising food prices. Would you be willing to change ethanol subsidies so that people are not using corn for ethanol, &amp; lowering food prices?A: We?ve got rising food prices here in the US. In other countries we?re seeing riots because of the lack of food supplies. So this is something that we?re going to have to deal with. There are a number of factors that go into this. Changes in climate are contributing. There?s no doubt that biofuels may be contributing to it. My top priority is making sure that people are able to get enough to eat. And if it turns out that we?ve got to make changes in our ethanol policy to help people get something to eat, then that?s got to be the step we take. But I also believe that ethanol has been a important transitional tool for us to start dealing with our long-term energy crisis ultimately. Over time we?re going to shift to cellulosic ethanol, where we?re not using food stocks but we?re using wood chips &amp; prairie grass.</p>

<h3><center> Genesis teaches stewardship of earth: sacrifice for future </center></h3>
<p>Q: Could you give an example of how you relate your faith to science policy?A: One of the things I draw from the Genesis story is the importance of us being good stewards of the land, of this incredible gift. And I think there have been times where we haven?t been [good stewards], and this is one of those times where we?ve got to take the warning seriously [about climate change]. And part of what my religious faith teaches me is to take an intergenerational view, to recognize that we are borrowing thi planet from our children and our grandchildren. And this is where religious faith and the science of global warming converge: We have to find resources in ourselves to make sacrifices so we don?t leave it to the next generation. We?ve got to be less wasteful, both as a society and in our own individual lives. I think religion can actually bolster our desire to make those sacrifices now. As president, I hope to rally the entire world around the importance of us being good stewards of the land.</p>

<h1 class="headline">Obama on the Issues</h1>
<h2 class="subhead">A look at Barack Obama&#8217;s environmental platform and record</h2>
<p>In the early months of Barack Obama&#8217;s presidential campaign, enviros were skeptical of his (<a href="http://grist.org/news/daily/2007/06/13/2/index.html">now heavily qualified</a>) support for coal-to-liquids technology and unvarnished enthusiasm for ethanol, but he earned their respect with his aggressive <a href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/newenergy" target="new" rel="noopener">climate and energy plan</a>. The plan centers on a cap-and-trade system that aims for 80 percent emission reductions from 1990 levels by 2050 and calls for auctioning 100 percent of the pollution permits. It also includes a $150 billion investment to boost clean energy and create green jobs, along with fine-grained proposals to boost efficiency, build a smart electricity grid, and encourage public transportation. Enviros have also applauded Obama&#8217;s <a href="http://www.grist.org/news/2008/04/29/gasTax/">refusal to endorse a gas-tax holiday</a> and his <a href="http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2008/8/4/9331/12757">now somewhat qualified</a> opposition to offshore oil drilling. Obama earned an 86 percent rating from the League of Conservation Voters for his first three years representing Illinois in the U.S. Senate (a lower score than might have been because he missed some votes while campaigning for president).</p>

But for voters in 36 states, electoral democracy exists beyond the parameters of representative government. In the states where the tools of direct democracy like referendums and ballot initiatives are employed, preferences of voters are gauged directly on amendments to state constitutions, specific policy questions, budgeting issues and more. Of the 153 measures at stake across the country in yesterday’s election, about a dozen dealt with energy and the environment.

<h5>[Music and Lyrics by J. Yellen and M. Ager]</h5>
<p>So long sad times<br />
Go long bad times<br />
We are rid of you at last</p>
<p>Howdy gay times<br />
Cloudy gray times<br />
You are now a thing of the past</p>
<p>Happy days are here again<br />
The skies above are clear again<br />
So let&#8217;s sing a song of cheer again<br />
Happy days are here again</p>
<p>Altogether shout it now<br />
There&#8217;s no one<br />
Who can doubt it now<br />
So let&#8217;s tell the world about it now<br />
Happy days are here again</p>
<p>Your cares and troubles are gone<br />
There&#8217;ll be no more from now on<br />
From now on &#8230;</p>
<p>Happy days are here again<br />
The skies above are clear again<br />
So, Let&#8217;s sing a song of cheer again</p>
<p>Happy times<br />
Happy nights<br />
Happy days<br />
Are here again!</p>

<p>Go vote today, and make sure you take your friends and family with you.</p>
<p>This is the day when we have to commit to doing everything we can. We can&#8217;t afford not to &#8212; for our families, our communities, and our future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Conspiracy theoriests say that this is the result of collusion between, Big Oil, Dick Cheney, President Bush, the Big Refiners, the Gasoline Dealerships and certain Rich Republicans (you know who you are) to artifishally lower the price of Oil and Gasoline to steal the election from Barack Obama and hand it to John McCain. Damn that was a long sentence.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not because the Oil Markets were destabilized by speculators for the first time in nearly 100 years and prices are going to swing widely as a result. I bet Oil Prices go to 40$$ per barrel, before they skyrocket out of sight again. The Saudi&#8217;s are getting soaked. That sucking sound you hear is billions of Saudi $$s flowing into the US. I imagine at some point the Saudi&#8217;s will take murder contracts out on the hedge fund managers, the super wealthy, and the currency traders who caused all this craziness in the first place. Which is fitting I suppose.</p>
<p>I am busy with the election so maybe no energy post to follow but Dan Piraro asked me to pass along a couple of cartoons that were rejected by a really really famous magazine that ethics prevents us from naming (Time):</p>
<p> <a href="http://bizarrocomic.blogspot.com/">http://bizarrocomic.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/piraro_time_01sm.jpg" title="piraro_time_01sm.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/piraro_time_01sm.jpg" alt="piraro_time_01sm.jpg" /></a></p>
<p> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/piraro_time_02sm.jpg" title="piraro_time_02sm.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/piraro_time_02sm.jpg" alt="piraro_time_02sm.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>If you find the titles too hard to read the first one says &#8220;mommy is too tired to run her hands under your bed clothes tonight, honey&#8221; and the other one says &#8220;let me put my glasses on because it doesn&#8217;t look as big as you said&#8221;</p>
<p>And if you believe that well you probably believe the conspiracy theory above. Oh go to dan&#8217;s web site and click on the cartoons. They magically get bigger and then you can read the print.</p>
<p>GET OUT AND VOTE!</p>

<p> Blumenthal, in addition to his on the scenes reporting, posts video of the sermon which Palin references (footage begins at 7:30). In it, the minister implores Jesus to protect Palin from &#8220;the spirit of witchcraft.&#8221; Earlier, he states, &#8220;We need God taking over our education system. If we have God in our schools, we will not have our kids being taught how to worship Buddha, how to worship Muhammad. We will not have in the curriculum witchcraft and sorcery.&#8221; He also preaches, &#8220;The other area is the media. We need believers in the media. We need God taking over the media in our lives.&#8221; </p>

<p class="story_sub_head">MINISTRY STUDENTS: Governor asked them to pray for troops, pipeline.</p>

The Associated Press</p>

<p><span class="adn_copy">Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin told ministry students at her former church that the United States sent troops to fight in the Iraq war on a &#8220;task that is from God.&#8221;</span><span class="adn_copy"></span><span class="adn_copy"></span><span class="adn_copy"></span><span class="adn_copy"></p>
<p class="link">In an address last June, the Republican vice presidential candidate also urged ministry students to pray for a plan to build a $30 billion natural gas pipeline in the state, calling it &#8220;God&#8217;s will.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story_readable">Palin asked the students to pray for the troops in Iraq and noted that her eldest son, Track, was expected to be deployed there.</p>
<p class="story_readable">&#8220;Our national leaders are sending them out on a task that is from God,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what we have to make sure that we&#8217;re praying for, that there is a plan and that plan is God&#8217;s plan.&#8221;</p>
<p class="story_readable">A video of the speech was posted at the Wasilla Assembly of God&#8217;s Web site before finding its way on to other sites on the Internet.</p>
<p class="story_readable">Palin told graduating students of the church&#8217;s School of Ministry, &#8220;What I need to do is strike a deal with you guys.&#8221; As they preached the love of Jesus throughout Alaska, she said, she&#8217;d work to implement God&#8217;s will from the governor&#8217;s office, including creating jobs by building a pipeline to bring North Slope natural gas to North American markets.</p>
<p class="story_readable">&#8220;God&#8217;s will has to be done in unifying people and companies to get that gas line built, so pray for that,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p class="story_readable"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhs-Faxi55o">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhs-Faxi55o</a></p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Now I know what you are thinking, many oil Executives have prayed and prayed that their pipelines got done on time and under budget. But that was so they didn&#8217;t lose any money. Sarah&#8217;s praying to get the pipelin to happen. Geez, I thought that was Congress and the EPA&#8217;s job. Happy Halloween!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What would our collective Presidential Energy Policy look like? :</p>
<p>1. Ban the sale of Gasoline and Diesel as of January 2015, except 1 gallon containers and Heavy Transport Trucks.</p>
<p>2. Ban Diesel and Gasoline sales to Heavey Transport Trucks by 2018.</p>
<p>This would allow everyone to keep mowing their grass and having their backyard barbeques while the USA shifts its transportation capacity to cleaner safer fuels.</p>
<p>3. Ban the Burning of coal in Electrical Generating Stations in 2020.</p>
<p>That would require switching all those plants to another fuel source, probably natural gas.</p>
<p>4. Fund 3 Hot Rocks Power Stations. One in California to replace Diablo Nuclear Power Plant, One to replace Clinton Nuclear Power Plant in Illinois and one to replace Savannah Nuclear Power Plant in Georgia. This would begin the proceess of Converting our economy to geothermal energy on existing sites where Nukes should not be in the first place.</p>
<p>This would proceed for all Nuclear Power Plants in the nation.</p>
<p> 5. Create and support manditory energy conservation programs in both the residential market and the commercial market to reduce their consumption by 50%.</p>
<p>Lets insulate and modernize our world.</p>
<p>6. Order all Landfill operaters and Waste Haulers to begin the mining of all landfills and dumps for metals, glass, plastics and and paper products. Compost the rest.</p>
<p>7. Mandate that all materials be recycled with the goal of a steady state materials economy in the USA by 2020</p>
<p>8. Using tax incentives to increase the Market share of solar, geothermal and wind generation by 25% per year until the USA is largely energy self sufficient.</p>
<p>9. Create a maglev train system in the USA</p>
<p>10. Create a light rail system in the top 50 major markets.</p>
<p>11. Ban the sale of diesel fuel to the railroads in 2025.</p>
<p>12. Open the Yucca Mountain repository by Executive Order if necessary and order all spent nuclear materials to be stored there.</p>
<p>To pay for this I would cut the military budgets of the following services: reduce the Navy to 2 active Fleets, one on the West Coast, one on the East Coast; reduce the Army to 4 batallions; reduce the Airforce to 4 Airwings; leave the Marines alone.</p>
<p>To pay for these policies I would slash the Pentagon staff in half, and the &#8220;spying budget&#8221; by 1/3.</p>
<p>To pay for these policies I would close the Federal Office of Education. Then I would start in on some of the stupid Federal Budget items that we as tax payers fund, like closing the National Helium Repository in Texas. We sure won&#8217;t need the Strategic Petroleum Resevre.</p>
<p>This program would create million of new good paying jobs. Put this country back to work and not flipping burgers at McDonalds.</p>
