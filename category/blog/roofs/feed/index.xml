										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know it has been awhile since I did a residential post. I know this started out as a blog about residential energy needs and services. You know, energy efficient roofs, HVAC equipment and other such stuff. But years ago, I got off on energy related environmental stuff and then eventually Global Warming. Then anti-Nuclear stuff. Finally just raw Environmental stuff like obnoxious polluting and horrible deaths. Well today a gentleman named Chris Winters reached out and touched me so I am touching him back, so to speak. As always, I can vouch for his tips because they are somewhat general, but anything specific he is pitching I can not (For instance AC controllers &#8211; which his company sells). Also I may have put up this as an addenda to any earlier piece, so if i did forgive me.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cielowigle.com/blog/energy-saving-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.cielowigle.com/blog/energy-saving-tips/</a></p>
<p>No matter what the season, energy usage tends to increase one way or another. With long running air conditioning and increased wash cycles of sweaty laundry in summer, to high heating usage and wash cycles of bulkier laundry in winter, we simply cannot operate without electricity.</p>
<p>We can be extremely energy efficient and follow energy saving tips and tricks to ingrain some environmentally friendly habits.</p>
<p>Following energy saving tips is essential to lower your costs, but it is also important to decrease your ecological footprint.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/2020/08/generation-green-is-leading-the-sustainability-agenda/">millennials and Gen Z nicknamed “generation green”</a>, there is a strong focus on energy saving, and rightly so. However, global warming is rising more rapidly than ever, and the term ‘climate emergency’ is being used rather than climate change to highlight the situation’s intensity.</p>
<p>All industries such as <a href="https://www.cielowigle.com/blog/climate-change/">HVAC are revolutionizing their technology to act on climate change</a>. Since home appliances and devices are a major contributor to our energy consumption, utilizing smart devices such as smart thermostats or <a href="https://www.cielowigle.com/">smart controllers for air conditioners</a> can make a huge difference on your bills!</p>
<p>Let’s get right to it. Here are 21 energy saving tips that can easily help you decrease your energy consumption:</p>
<h2 id="h-1-use-energy-efficient-appliances">1. Use Energy Efficient Appliances</h2>
<p>Energy efficient appliances are specially designed to consume minimum energy to complete the same tasks that you’d perform with normal appliances.  In addition, some</p>

<p>&#8220;Families are starting to move into what is being called America&#8217;s first solar-powered town,&#8221; announces <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/sexual-misconduct/john-dickerson-replaces-charlie-rose-cbs-morning-n836096" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Dickerson</a> for CBS This Morning on Jan. 16. &#8220;<a href="https://www.babcockranch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Babcock Ranch</a>, about half an hour northeast of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Myers,_Florida" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fort Myers,</a> Florida, is supposed to produce more energy than it consumes once it&#8217;s finished.&#8221;</p>
<p>Developer <a href="http://kitsonpartners.com/executive-team/sydney-kitson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syd Kitson</a> is building 20,000 homes for a projected 50,000 people, states Dickerson in the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/inside-floridas-solar-powered-babcock-ranch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newscast video </a>accompanying the article.</p>
<blockquote><p>There are more than 300,000 solar panels spread across 440 acres there, producing enough electricity not only for the town, but also the surrounding areas, reports CBS News&#8217; <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/team/manuel-bojorquez/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manuel Bojorquez</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>One critical energy element lacking in the solar-powered community will be adequate energy storage to allow the city to be truly self-powered:</p>
<blockquote><p>The town doesn&#8217;t run on solar power all the time. At night, when the sun is down, it has to draw from the traditional electrical grid. Kitson says the technology for storing all that surplus energy the solar cells generate during the day is still too costly.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am a graduate of Sangamon State University. What is now University of Illinois Springfield. They just build a Student Union and I am so proud of it. It could be LEED certified and it is student centered. Our Student Union was in a temporary building 0n the temporary campus &#8220;down the hill&#8221;. This is just so cool.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rGKhFojmcy"><p><a href="https://www.uis.edu/advancement/choose/student-union/strategic-design/">Strategic Design of the UIS Student Union</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://www.uis.edu/advancement/choose/student-union/strategic-design/embed/#?secret=rGKhFojmcy" data-secret="rGKhFojmcy" width="584" height="329" title="&#8220;Strategic Design of the UIS Student Union&#8221; &#8212; Office of Advancement" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>This is the part I like:</p>
<h3>Environmentally Excellent</h3>
<p>UIS is seeking a LEED Gold certificate (Leadership in Energy &amp; Environmental Design, awarded by the U.S. Green Building Council), both for the sake of the environment and in order to take advantage of energy saving measures. For this reason, the building will have a green, or “living,” roof with vegetation and a growing medium over a sloped membrane. This roof will provide insulation, help to lower air temperatures, and last much longer than other roofs—50 to 60 years rather than the 20 to 30 years most roofs last. The vegetation will most likely include wildflowers that will change throughout the growing season, adding to the building’s beauty.</p>
<p>To reduce storm runoff and eliminate water irrigation, the Student Union will have a rainwater reclamation system that takes advantage of the roof’s slope. Also in consideration of LEED approvals, lighting will be designed to meet the USGBC’s very stringent requirements.</p>

<p>Go there and read. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me say right off the bat that there is a &#8220;down side&#8221; to this program in that ownership is never transferred to the tenants. In other words, in most leasing arrangements after a number of years the tenants take ownership of the solar panels. Under this program it appears that the &#8220;leasing arrangement&#8221; lasts forever. Still I would definitely participate if given the opportunity. The Dutch are really smart folks.</p>

<li><strong>Department for International Trade helps secure £160 million of capital expenditure into UK renewable energy backed by Dutch investors</strong></li>
<li><strong>Investment will unlock £1 billion solar panel installation programme that will result in annual energy savings of up to £192m for 800,000 households</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>International Trade Minister Greg Hands today welcomed £160 million of capital expenditure into UK renewable energy backed by Dutch investors, the first step in a £1 billion programme to give over 800,000 poorer households access to cheap solar electricity.</p>
<p>The investment from Maas Capital (part of the ABN AMRO Bank), secured thanks to Department for International Trade (DIT) support, will help fund solar panels from UK firm Solarplicity to produce electricity for affordable housing across England and Wales.</p>
<p>The scheme will see Solarplicity partner with social housing providers to install panels on their housing stock, creating a Community Energy Scheme where tenants benefit from long-term guaranteed discounts on their bills. Around 100,000 households will receive panels in the next 18 months, and 800,000 in the next five years.</p>
<p>The panels will be free to social housing tenants, reducing their energy bills by an average of £240 a year, saving up to £192 million in total, with 100% renewable electricity.</p>
<p>The deal will also create over 1,000 new jobs to install and maintain the panels. Many of these jobs will go to veterans from the armed forces, as Solarplicity helps re-train them into new maintenance careers.</p>
<p>Speaking from a social housing development in Ealing, West London, where new solar panels are being installed, Minister Hands said:</p>

<h4>History of Destiny USA</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="col_1">
<p>Carousel Center opened its doors on October 15, 1990 after several years of land redevelopment and renovation on the shores of Onondaga Lake in Syracuse, NY. The super-regional shopping center was developed on a former Brownfield site; one so ravaged by environmental negligence that the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/17/nyregion/can-a-mall-at-a-toxic-dump-revive-an-ailing-syracuse.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm">New York Times</a><a>[m1]</a>   called it “a kind of monument to 20<sup>th</sup> century environmental arrogance, its future written off by government and business alike.”</p>
<p>Robert Congel and Pyramid Management Group welcomed the responsibility of this cleanup after drawing up plans to build a new shopping center in Syracuse. Originally, plans were created for a different location but Mr. Congel redirected his attention to “Oil City.” It was an opportunity to cleanup the lakefront disaster and make it the thriving economic engine that it is today.</p>
<p>Destiny USA is continuing to build upon Mr. Congel’s history of projects that improve Syracuse environmentally. This project is taking a path of leadership in the commercial retail industry by cooperating with the United States Green Building Council (USGBC, <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/destiny-usa-in-syracuse-aims-to-be-americas-largest-leed-gold-certified-commercial-retail-project-more-than-100-tenant-retail-spaces-to-also-be-certified-131520943.html">USGBC on Destiny USA)</a><a>[m2]</a>   to get its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) for Core and Shell certification. After meticulous work, the USGBC deemed the 1.3 million square foot Core &amp; Shell expansion its LEED® Gold Certification on February 6, 20</p>

<h1>Solar energy is ready, the U.S. isn&#8217;t</h1>
<h5>By Ken Wells</h5>
<h5 title="2012-10-28T17:07:15Z">Published 5:07 p.m., Sunday, October 28, 2012</h5>
<div>
<p>Clean energy has become a dirty word in presidential politics.</p>
<p>In their second debate, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/?controllerName=search&amp;action=search&amp;channel=business&amp;search=1&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;query=%22Mitt+Romney%22">Mitt Romney</a> and Barack <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/barack-obama/">Obama</a> each tried to outdo the other&#8217;s love of fossil fuels: Obama extolling his record on oil and natural gas production, Romney vowing to take &#8220;advantage of the oil and coal we have here.&#8221; The Republican candidate has ridiculed the administration&#8217;s $535 million loan guarantee to Solyndra, the bankrupt solar panel maker, and accused Obama of living &#8220;in an imaginary world where government-subsidized windmills and solar panels could power the economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The candidates&#8217; coolness to renewable energy comes at a time when the domestic supply of traditional energy sources, such as oil and natural gas, is at an all-time high. And yet this failure to make the promise of renewables a keynote in the debate is a huge missed opportunity. In particular, it ignores the dramatic reduction in the cost of photovoltaic solar power worldwide and the considerable benefits to U.S. consumers and the environment.</p>
<h3>Political roadblocks</h3>
<p>The untold story of this campaign is that what killed Solyndra may turn out to be a boon for the nation. &#8220;Economically and technologically, the game is over,&#8221; said <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/?controllerName=search&amp;action=search&amp;channel=business&amp;search=1&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;query=%22Bill+Powers%22">Bill Powers</a>, a San Diego engineer and board member of Solar Done Right, a group that proselytizes for rooftop solar power. &#8220;The hang-ups in the U.S. are strictly political.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the past five years the price of photovoltaic panels has plummeted 75 percent, due largely to a glut of Chinese-made panels. The fall in prices rendered technically advanced photovoltaic panels, like those produced by Solyndra and other U.S. companies, too expensive to compete.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first saw the headline of this next site, I thought: can this be? I had heard of actual corn cob houses in rural America. They are basically slatted walls filled in with corn cobs and then finished inside and out. They are sort of a variation of hay bale houses. But this is way different.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.livingoffgrid.org/building-a-cob-house/">http://www.livingoffgrid.org/building-a-cob-house/</a></p>
<h2><a title="Building a Cob House" href="http://www.livingoffgrid.org/building-a-cob-house/">Building a Cob House</a></h2>
<p>By Off Grid Ebert</p>
<p>In a time in which we are increasingly hearing <a href="http://www.acoolerclimate.com/10-scary-facts-about-global-warming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scary statistics about the fate of our planet</a>, the way forward in the field of sustainable, <a href="http://www.dancingrabbit.org/building/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">green building</a> may just be to go backward.  This is certainly the case for people demonstrating a growing interest in building earthen homes and structures using an ancient method known as cobwork or cobbing.  Cobbing, believed to have originated in the Maghreb as early as the 11th century, spread into wide usage across many parts of the rest of Europe as the main building style for homes.  The name of this style of building comes from the word cob, which is the name of the building material itself, formed of a mixture of earth (such as clay, sand, and other soil), straw, and water.  Despite what the materials may imply, this substance, when dried, is fireproof.  It is also inexpensive, and naturally cool in the summer heat and relatively easy to heat in the winter.</p>
<p>Many homes built of this material centuries ago still stand and remain in use.  Pictured here to the left is a cob house in England, believed to have been built in the late 1700s. (Photo by Tim Green, <a title="Link added by VigLink" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/atoach/4927564858/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/atoach/4927564858/</a>) These homes typically have thatched roofs, while small but efficient fireplaces with chimneys provide warmth when the weather is cold.</p>
<p>The appearance and texture of cob varies from region to region, depending on the available natural resources and their characteristics.  As such, cob is one of the most versatile building materials on earth.  It can be molded and shaped into whatever form is framed by the builder.</p>

<p>Five Models of Energy Efficiency: A Guide to Beautiful, Energy-Efficient Homes</p>
<p>Five US builders are being honored for their exceptional achievements in high performance building at the second annual BASF <a href="http://www.hgtvpro.com/hpro/green_building/article/0,3142,HPRO_27916_5942677,00.html">Builders Challenge</a> Awards.</p>
<p>Led by the U.S Department of Energy (DOE), the Builders  Challenge is working with homebuilders across America to build a new  generation of high-performance homes, working toward the ultimate goal  of providing cost-effective, net-zero energy homes by 2030  for all  Americans.</p>
<p>To qualify for the Builders Challenge, homes must meet at least a 70 on the <a href="http://www.hgtvpro.com/hpro/green_building/article/0,3142,HPRO_27916_5946464,00.html">EnergySmart Home Scale (E-Scale)</a> &#8212; which means they must use at least 30 percent less energy than a typical new home built to code.</p>
