										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Her is why I say that Airplanes are the prime culprits of Global Warming. First: They Fly High. While fossil fueled Power Plants and Surface Transport Fleets emit huge green house gases many of them are mitigated before they can have much of a green house effect. But most jets fly right up there. I mean even some prop planes do too.</p>
<p>Second: The Fuel. Especially military flight fuel is bloody near kerosene.</p>
<p>Third: There are so many. It may be a myth but after 911 when so many planes were grounded the tempeture dropped a degree.</p>
<p>So this is kinda cool. Maybe we should call them personal air taxi&#8217;s or something. Yes they will be expensive. So what.</p>

<div class="c-byline">By <span class="c-byline__item"> <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/umair-irfan">Umair Irfan</a> </span> <span class="c-byline__item"> <time class="c-byline__item" datetime="2019-05-14T16:30:00+00:00" data-ui="timestamp"> May 14, 2019, 12:30pm EDT </time></span></div>
<p id="khu5UD">It’s becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the fact that air travel is a massive and growing problem for the global climate.</p>
<p id="e0cf0M">In the US, transportation is now the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, and aircraft account for <a href="https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/regulations-greenhouse-gas-emissions-aircraft">12 percent</a> of transportation emissions. <a href="https://www.bts.dot.gov/newsroom/2018-traffic-data-us-airlines-and-foreign-airlines-us-flights">US air travel</a> reached a record high last year, pushing up overall <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/1/8/18174082/us-carbon-emissions-2018">emissions</a> even while the power sector saw a decline.</p>
<p id="P7RqPM">To make matters worse, demand for flights is growing. Emissions from air travel are poised to spike up to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/aviation_en">sevenfold</a> globally by 2050 if nothing else changes.</p>
<p id="w6PQSS">That’s why it’s so urgent to decarbonize air travel. Yet the technical challenges are immense. Alternatives like carbon-neutral biofuels remain far too costly. And the stodgy rules in the heavily regulated, risk-averse aviation sector lag far behind advances in electric drivetrains.</p>

<p>They are currently flying small electric planes on a regional basis.</p>
<p>Go there and see the future. More next week.</p>

<p>PANA – Apparently building a moonbuggy wasn’t hard enough.</p>
<p>Pana High School students this year are setting out to build a solar-powered car from scratch and race it across Texas to California as part of the <a href="http://www.solarcarchallenge.org/challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 Solar Car Challenge</a>.</p>
<p>Building the battery-powered four-wheeled rovers that Apollo astronauts used on the moon in the early 1970s is a tradition at Pana.</p>
<p>But industrial arts teacher Steve Bonser said students learned about the solar car challenge this summer and decided to give it a shot — despite being warned it wouldn’t be easy.</p>
<p>“The kids voted unanimously to up the game and take on a lot more work and build this solar car,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Starting to take shape</strong></p>
<p>The framework of what will hopefully become a solar-powered car is beginning to take shape in the shop at the junior high school.</p>
<p>Bonser said the students have finished most of the design work and constructed the frame for the 8-foot long car. The goal is to have the entire vehicle, which will be street legal, finished in March.</p>
<p>Still early on in the process, Bonser said, the school was fortunate Battery Specialists in Taylorville donated a golf cart, which will provide some parts.</p>
<div class="ad-container"> The school also acquired solar panels that will power the battery. But much of how it will all come together is still an unknown.</div>
</div>

<p>Go there and read. Please donate to this project. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Much like Solar and Wind, Electric Cars have had an up hill battle. But what does that mean. It makes it sound like this is natural. Well it is not. Electric Cars were not about &#8220;ramping up&#8221; to need. It was about battling the forces of evil who did not want alternative forms of energy to succeed. Yah that is right, the fossil fuel industry and their investors and supporters have done everything in their considerable power to prevent their success. They have lied, cheated and lobbied elected bodies all the way down to townships in Colorado for example.</p>

<p id="hmZlpm">General Motors announced today that it will introduce two new all-electric vehicles within the next 18 months, the first of at least 20 new EVs that the automaker will launch by 2023. GM also renewed its commitment to hydrogen fuel cell technology, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/13/15257576/hydrogen-fuel-cell-honda-clarity-self-driving-ny-auto-show-2017">clean fuel concept</a> that still needs major infrastructure upgrades before it can become a viable alternative.</p>
<p id="rUwDEh">At a press conference in Detroit this morning, GM’s executive vice president of global product development Mark Reuss said that the company was “committed to an all-electric future,” but cautioned that it wasn’t going to happen “by flipping a switch.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While this piece is important, it is also kind of cutsie in the fact that all the nuclear waste mentioned is well taken care of. Still I want to make 2 points.</p>
<p>1, I always thought and still do, that Yucca Mountain is a perfect place to store nuclear waste. I was pissed when Obama tried to call the whole thing off and I am glad that the Trump administration is trying to reopen it. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I do not like much of what Trump has done so far BUT this is just fine.</p>
<p>2, Illinois had the perfect opportunity to be the nations nuclear waste dump for real. Northern Illinois between Chicago and the Mississippi River is virtually earthquake free. Like for 1000s of years. As soon as Obama defunded Yucca Mountain we could have stepped up and said, &#8220;We will build it here&#8221;. Illinois could have gotten Billions of Dollars and 100s if not a 1000 jobs, and the waste would have had a very short train trip to disposal. They could have even used trucks. Then it would have been up to the rest of the States to figure out how to get their waste here.  But no, that would have been tooo bold, so now we are back to the beginning.</p>

<h1 class="post-title">Illinois Issues: The Prairie State&#8217;s Nuclear Waste Conundrum</h1>
<div class="by-date"><span class="submitted"><span class="submitted-label">By</span> <span class="name">Kevin McDermott</span></span> <i class="bullet">•</i> <span class="pub-date">Jul 20, 2017 </span></div>
<p><em><strong>The Land of Lincoln is the country&#8217;s largest de facto nuclear waste dump.</strong></em></p>
<p>Under a federal measure passed 30 years ago, the spent fuel from America’s nuclear reactors is supposed to be permanently buried out in the Mojave Desert, tucked deep under a mountain, far from any population center and easily guarded</p>
<p>In reality, though, that radioactive waste – tens of thousands of tons of it – is sitting in temporary storage at dozens of current and former nuclear power sites all over the country, as it has been for decades. The largest portion of it is divided among seven sites that dot the nation’s fifth-largest state: Illinois.</p>
<p>The story of how the Land of Lincoln became the nation&#8217;s biggest de facto nuclear waste dump is a tale of public fear, political pragmatism and the power of NIMBY (<em>Not In My Back Yard</em>).</p>
<p>It’s a story that radiates political irony. Among those responsible for Illinois’ atomic dilemma is the state’s favorite son, Barack Obama, who scuttled a decades-old project that was to have created a national nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.</p>

<p>Go there and read. Think about it. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I never really thought about cars this way before. It seems the more they HELP you drive the more expensive and complicated they are. If the car drives you, it will have a very complicated electronics system but a pretty simple structure. This would mean a much cheaper car and a radically restructured automobile industry.</p>

<p>Would you be okay with your car bossing you around if it saved you fuel, and therefore money? Bosch is hoping that you won&#8217;t mind a few extra pointers on the road with its new <a href="http://www.bosch-mobility-solutions.com/en/connected-mobility/active-gas-pedal/" target="_blank" data-s-object-id="articleBody" data-component="externalLink">active gas pedal</a>, which the company believes can decrease fuel consumption by 7 percent.</p>
<p>Of course, creating a smart gas pedal is a complicated endeavor. By connecting to a vehicle&#8217;s various electronic systems, it can use haptic feedback (Bosch mentions vibration, knocking and variable pedal resistance) to tell the driver when to shift, when to cut back on wasteful acceleration and even when a hybrid vehicle is about to switch from electric- to gas-based propulsion.</p>
<p>While going green is a big part of this new pedal, there&#8217;s also a safety angle to it. Not only can the pedal be linked to active safety systems like forward collision warning or parking sensors, but it could also connect to the navigation system to prevent drivers from taking corners with too much <em>chutzpah</em>. And once vehicle-to-vehicle technology becomes common, the pedal can be used to warn drivers of upcoming hazards like potholes or stopped vehicles.</p>
