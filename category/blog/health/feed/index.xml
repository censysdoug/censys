										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seriously, if Love Canal wouldn&#8217;t take it then there are Super Fund sites like Rocky Flats Weapons Factory that would. We could put up honorary members like the originators and manufacturers of Agent Orange, Whose ever idea leaded gasoline was, maybe the inventor and manufacturers of Mustard Gas. But the people who proposed and actually carried out atomic fracking must go near the top of the list.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago Pennsylvania officials were presented a plan to detonate a nuclear device below north-central Pennsylvania. While the project never got past the planning stages it was part of a larger plan to use nuclear bombs in natural gas extraction.Â (<cite>Pennsylvania State Archives</cite>)</p>

<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This story has been update to fix broken art on this article.</em></p>
<p>HARRISBURG &#8212; In May 1966, Columbia Gas and the federal Atomic Energy Commission presented an audacious plan to a representative of the Governor&#8217;s Science Advisory Committee: A proposal to detonate a nuclear bomb more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima 3,500 feet below north-central Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the present stage, this proposal involves a detonation of a &#8216;shot&#8217; of perhaps 20,000 tons TNT equivalent at a location on the boundary between Centre and Clinton counties,&#8221; wrote Louis Roddis Jr., the governor&#8217;s representative in his report.</p>
<p>The goal was to use the nuclear blast to create a chamber that could then be filled with pressurized natural gas. Named Project Ketch, the proposal was an offshoot of another nuclear explosive-powered idea, Project Gasbuggy, which called on increasing natural gas production by detonating nuclear bombs underground to fracture rock deposits &#8212; nuclear fracking.</p>
<p>From the get-go, however, Roddis noted there would be challenges to the proposal. Safety considerations, he wrote, fell under three categories: seismic problems, immediate radioactivity problems, and long-term radioactivity problems.</p>

<li><em>Throughout 2018, efforts to protect habitats and conserve threatened species were driven by governments, scientists, NGOs and indigenous communities.</em></li>
<li><em>The world pledged more conservation funding to protect the oceans, while protections for coastal ecosystems were also boosted.</em></li>

<p>âI like to envision the whole world as a jigsaw puzzle with all the pieces of puzzle scattered all over the place. If you look at the whole picture it is overwhelming and terrifying, but if you work on your little part of the jigsaw and know that people all over the world are working on their little bits of it, thatâs what will give you hope,â Jane Goodall, the world-renowned primatologist and conservationist and Mongabay adviser, says in a <a href="https://web.facebook.com/janegoodall/posts/i-like-to-envision-the-whole-world-as-a-jigsaw-puzzle-with-all-the-pieces-of-the/10155236692247171/?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr" target="_blank" rel="external noopener" data-wpel-link="external">post on her Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>Hope for global conservation is what we wish to evoke in our readers with some of the more upbeat environmental stories from the past year that we have pieced together from around the world in this list. These include some of your favorite happy stories, from the expansion of protected areas for wildlife, cancelled reclamation projects that posed coastal ecosystem threats, to the impactful role of indigenous communities in conservation.</p>

<p>On a housekeeping note, websites contact me all the time to say, you cite this source: this one is better or more up-to-date or broken and here we fixed it. they want inserted in the actual Blog post that relates directly to their &#8220;improvement&#8221;. I AM ONE guy. I can neither verify what they say is true OR get in edit mode and go back in time for years. So, I am going to post them here as addenda.

<p>I saw you mentioned the Wikipedia guide to led lights on your page:</p>

<p>Coal ash disposal sites throughout Illinois, including at City Water, Light and Powerâs Dallman Power Station in Springfield, have contaminated surrounding groundwater supplies, according to a report released Wednesday by a consortium of environmental groups.</p>
<p>CWLP officials responded that the cityâs ash ponds do not pose a risk to Springfieldâs water supply.</p>
<p>The reportâs results are based on data sets made public for the first time earlier this year as part of new federal regulations of coal ash, a toxic byproduct of coal-fired power generation that is commonly stored in unlined ponds or landfills near the plants. <a href="https://illinoiscoalash.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/il_coalash_groundwaterreport_hr.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The report</a> by the Environmental Integrity Project, Earthjustice, Prairie Rivers Network and the Sierra Club found toxic pollutants emanating from 22 of 24 coal ash dump sites for which the data became available in March.</p>
<p>The coalition called for new legislative standards that would protect groundwater and regulate the closure of coal ash ponds to be drafted next year.</p>
<p>âIllinois needs to act now to strengthen rules that protect the public from coal ash,â said Andrew Rehn, a water resources engineer from Prairie Rivers Network. âWeâre reaching a turning point as Energy companies are proposing to leave coal ash in floodplains of rivers and exposed to groundwater. We need stronger rules that provide permanent protection with a financial guarantee and give the public a voice in these decisions.â</p>

<p class="css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0">America fails to capture some two-thirds of the power it generates, much of it through simple waste, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/americans-used-more-clean-energy-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to federal data</a>. In a recent survey, the United States was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://aceee.org/portal/national-policy/international-scorecard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranked eighth</a> among 23 of the worldâs top energy-consuming countries in efficiency, behind several European nations, China and Japan.</p>

<p class="css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0">Energy efficiency is one of the most powerful resources we have for meeting our energy and environmental goals. It is also an enormous economic opportunity.</p>
<p class="css-1i0edl6 e2kc3sl0">Setting aside the significant environmental impact, this energy waste costs American businesses and households billions of dollars every year.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All the capitalists care about is the money. So what if somebody dies making the power? So what if making the power kills someone? As long as they get their 100,000K profit or whatever it is. The numbers really have to mount before they even notice.

<p>New plans to build two commercial <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-the-offshore-wind-industry-is-about-to-take-off-95997" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offshore wind farms</a> near the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> and <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rhode-island">Rhode Island</a> coasts have sparked a lot of <a href="http://capeandislands.org/post/vineyard-wind-hears-public-concerns#stream/0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussion</a> about the <a href="https://www.boem.gov/Offshore-Wind-Energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vast potential of this previously untapped source of electricity</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="Raw-s1p4r1tl-0 jioFUO">
<p>But as <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_h0VdMkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an environmental health and climate researcher</a>, I&#8217;m intrigued by how this gust of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/11/7/074019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offshore wind power</a> may improve <a href="https://www.usnews.com/topics/subjects/public_health">public health</a>. Replacing fossil fuels with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2771" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wind and solar energy</a>, research shows, can <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce risks of asthma, hospitalizations and heart attacks</a>. In turn, that can save lives.</p>
</div>
<div class="Raw-s1p4r1tl-0 jioFUO">
<p>So my colleagues and I calculated the health impact of generating electricity through <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/5/25/17393156/offshore-wind-us-massachusetts-rhode-island-zinke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offshore wind turbines</a> â which until now the U.S. has barely begun to do.</p>

<p>New England gets almost none of its electricity from burning coal and more than three-quarters of it from burning <a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/about/key-stats/resource-mix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural gas and operating nuclear reactors</a>. The rest is from hydropower and from renewable energy, including wind and solar power and the burning of wood and refuse.</p>

<h1>Coal, nuclear plant operator files for bankruptcy, asks Trump for a bailout</h1>
<h2>FirstEnergy&#8217;s request comes after regulator struck down an industry-wide bailout plan.</h2>

<p>On Saturday, power corporation FirstEnergy placed its coal and nuclear generation units <a href="https://cms.arstechnica.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=226681&amp;action=edit">under chapter 11 bankruptcy</a>. Although coal and nuclear plants across the country have struggled to compete with the low prices of natural gas, FirstEnergy&#8217;s filing is unique because it stands to take on a political dimension. Just two days before FirstEnergy&#8217;s bankruptcy filing, the company petitioned the Department of Energy (DOE) for an emergency bailout, <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/firstenergy-asks-doe-for-emergency-action-to-save-pjm-coal-nuke-plants/520280/">citing concerns about reliability</a>.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p>The petition could reinvigorate a debate started by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/energy-secretary-proposes-rule-to-make-grid-managers-favor-coal-nuclear/">proposed a rule</a> last year to change how coal and nuclear plants are compensated for their power. The rule was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/federal-regulator-denies-rick-perrys-proposal-to-compensate-coal-nuclear/">denied by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> (FERC), which said that there was not enough evidence to justify changing how coal and nuclear are compensated.</p>
<p>FirstEnergy disparaged FERC&#8217;s decision in <a href="https://statepowerproject.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/fes-202c-application.pdf">its Thursday petition</a> (PDF), claiming that &#8220;as a result of FERCâs and the RTO&#8217;s [Regional Transmission Organization&#8217;s] failure to address this crisis, swift and decisive action is needed <em>now</em> to address this imminent loss of nuclear and coal-fired baseload generation and the threat to the electric grid that this loss poses&#8221; (emphasis FirstEnergy&#8217;s).</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia has a plan to wean its economy off oil. In the biggest sign of what the future of the Gulf state would look like, Saudi Arabiaâs crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, has signed a memorandum of understanding with Japanese multinational Softbank to build 200 GW of solar power by 2030 at a cost of $200 billion.</p>
<p>These are eye-popping numbers. If built, that solar-power plant will be about 200 times the size of the biggest solar plant operating today. It would more than triple Saudi Arabiaâs capacity to produce electricity, from about 77 GW today.</p>
<p>With current technology, solar panels capable of generating 200 GW would likely cover 5,000 sq kmâan area larger than the the worldâs largest cities.</p>

<h1>Worst-hit reactor at Fukushima may be easiest to clean up</h1>
<div class="author">By MARI YAMAGUCHI Associated Press</div>

<p>OKUMA, Japan (AP) â High atop Fukushima&#8217;s most damaged nuclear reactor, the final pieces of a jelly-roll shaped cover are being put in place to seal in highly radioactive dust.</p>
<p>Blown apart by a hydrogen explosion in 2011 after an earthquake and tsunami hit Japan&#8217;s Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, reactor Unit 3 is undergoing painstaking construction ahead of a milestone that is the first step toward dismantling the plant.</p>
<p>The operating floor â from where new fuel rods used to be lowered into the core â has been rebuilt and if all goes as planned, huge cranes will begin removing 566 sets of still-radioactive fuel rods from a storage pool just below it later this year.</p>
<p>It has taken seven years just to get this far, but now the real work of cleaning up the Tokyo Electric Power Co. plant can begin.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you compare it with mountain climbing, we&#8217;ve only been preparing to climb. Now, we finally get to actually start climbing,&#8221; said Daisuke Hirose, an official at the plant&#8217;s decommissioning and decontamination unit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People have always said the Donald Trump was smart as a fox. Or that his antics distract from what he really wants, and that he ALways gets what he wants. It has even been said that he is like a major league hitter who whiffs sometimes but hits out of the park enough to have a great average. I think he is just a dumb ass with a lot of money to cover up his mistakes. This is such a doozy that ain&#8217;t no mount of money gonna make up for it. Even the conservatives agree.</p>

<p>The Corner The one and only. âTaking Us to the Cleanersâ</p>
<p>by Veronique de Rugy January 24, 2018 1:36 PM</p>
<p>The title of this post comes from the great Don Boudreaux, professor of economics and a free-trade warrior, over at Cafe Hayek.</p>
<p>It is the perfect soundbite to the Trump administrationâs decision to impose a penalty on Americans who buy foreign-made solar panels and washers. The administration, of course, doesnât call it that. Instead, it calls it a 30 percent tariff of solar panels and imported washers to protect our domestic manufactures.</p>
<p>Here is what the the solar protection looks like: &#8221; The solar trade protection â which applies to solar panels as well as cells, the piece of equipment that converts sunlight into electricity â is a 30% tariff in the first year, declining to 15% by a fourth year. The first 2.5 gigawatts of cells imported annually is exempt from the tariff.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a perfect example of the profound deficiencies in the process that leads to applying a tariff, which I wrote about last week. The Wall Street Journal reports: &#8220;The solar tariff is a response to a petition filed at the International Trade Commission by two U.S.-based manufacturers â Chinese-owned Suniva, which filed for bankruptcy last year, and German-owned SolarWorld Americas, whose parent company filed for bankruptcy last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>Go there and read. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am a graduate of Sangamon State University. What is now University of Illinois Springfield. They just build a Student Union and I am so proud of it. It could be LEED certified and it is student centered. Our Student Union was in a temporary building 0n the temporary campus &#8220;down the hill&#8221;. This is just so cool.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rGKhFojmcy"><p><a href="https://www.uis.edu/advancement/choose/student-union/strategic-design/">Strategic Design of the UIS Student Union</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://www.uis.edu/advancement/choose/student-union/strategic-design/embed/#?secret=rGKhFojmcy" data-secret="rGKhFojmcy" width="584" height="329" title="&#8220;Strategic Design of the UIS Student Union&#8221; &#8212; Office of Advancement" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>This is the part I like:</p>
<h3>Environmentally Excellent</h3>
<p>UIS is seeking a LEED Gold certificate (Leadership in Energy &amp; Environmental Design, awarded by the U.S. Green Building Council), both for the sake of the environment and in order to take advantage of energy saving measures. For this reason, the building will have a green, or âliving,â roof with vegetation and a growing medium over a sloped membrane. This roof will provide insulation, help to lower air temperatures, and last much longer than other roofsâ50 to 60 years rather than the 20 to 30 years most roofs last. The vegetation will most likely include wildflowers that will change throughout the growing season, adding to the buildingâs beauty.</p>
<p>To reduce storm runoff and eliminate water irrigation, the Student Union will have a rainwater reclamation system that takes advantage of the roofâs slope. Also in consideration of LEED approvals, lighting will be designed to meet the USGBCâs very stringent requirements.</p>
