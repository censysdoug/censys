										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was electricity from coal before there was gasoline driven cars. Still they are a big part of the problem. As other people have pointed out we are literally forced to drive. That is not to overlook the damage that big ocean ships and airplanes. I mean, Coal, Oil, Hot Asphalt and kerosene are the Big Four of Death.</p>
<p>Still it is hard to deny the seduction of the gasoline internal combustion engine. I got my first one when i was 14. It was a 90 cc Honda Motorcycle and it meant freedom to me. I could go from small town to small town in central Illinois. Meet new people, make new friends for a Quarter (.25$) per Gallon of gas. In fact I met my first true love who was riding a dirt bike on a back road blacktop, on the Honda.</p>
<p>How was I to know how dangerous they are, and that does not include the ones killed by operating them.</p>

<p>The summer I was eighteen, I visited a parking lot forty-five minutes north of town and got behind the wheel for what I hoped would be the first real rite of my adulthood. I was tall, gangly, excitable. Less than a week earlier, following a brief stretch of test-taking at the Department of Motor Vehicles in San Francisco, I had received my learner’s permit. Learning in those days seemed easy. Tests were easy. Doing—when the matter arose at all—was hard. Behind the wheel, I made a show of adjusting the mirrors, as if preparing for a ten-mile journey in reverse. I surveyed the blank pavement ahead of me and slowly slid the gear-shift from park into drive.</p>
<p>Cars had been my first passion. As a two-year-old, I’d learned to recognize the make of vehicles by the logo near the fender or perched on the hood. I grew to understand the people in my life according to their cars; I learned what sort of person <em class="">I</em> was from my parents’ two old Hondas, one of which, a used beige Accord, I had gone with them to buy. My father’s lingering bachelor vehicle, a rotting yellow Civic, needed to be choked awake on dewy mornings, and I’d performed that job with relish, pulling out the knob beside the steering wheel, waiting a long moment, and pushing it back. This was the late eighties. Gas prices had fallen, and the roads were knotty with cars from across the world. I no longer remember what, as a small child, I envisaged for my future, but I know that it involved moving at speed behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Now, all those years later, the parking lot was virtually empty of cars, and I felt a flush of reassurance. I was learning in my parents’ highly defatigable ride, a minivan with an all-plastic interior and the turning radius of a dump truck. My teacher was my father, a flawless but not wholly valiant driver, who habitually refused to drive on certain bridges in certain directions, for fear of being, as he would put it, “hypnotized” by trusses passing alongside the road. For reasons lost to time, my little sister was on board, too, in the back. I eased my foot onto the gas; the engine revved for a moment, and the van lurched.</p>

<p>Go there and read and read and read, More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First they destroy the Gulf of Mexico and now they are after your car. When these things happen, they always appear clueless. Really.</p>
<p>I was going to write about the drought today again, but there are some stories that you can not pass up.</p>
<p><a href="http://consumerist.com/2012/08/bps-bad-gas-made-it-into-200-stations-in-chicago-area-affecting-at-least-7000-customers.html">http://consumerist.com/2012/08/bps-bad-gas-made-it-into-200-stations-in-chicago-area-affecting-at-least-7000-customers.html</a></p>
<h2>BP’s Bad Gas Made It Into 200 Stations In Chicago Area, Affecting At Least 7,000 Customers</h2>
<p>By <a title="Posts by Mary Beth Quirk" rel="author" href="http://consumerist.com/author/mbquirk">Mary Beth Quirk</a> on  							August 23, 2012 10:00 AM</p>
<p>Since the news hit this week that <a href="http://consumerist.com/2012/08/customers-cant-seem-to-get-bp-on-the-phone-after-unleaded-gas-recall-in-indiana.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tainted gas from a BP fuel storage facility in northwest Indiana could be causing drivers to have problems with their vehicles</a>,  it seems BP had to scramble a bit to get a gauge on how bad the  situation is. The company has churned out a few press releases in the  last few days, and has now alerted customers and the media that about  200 retail gas outlets in Indiana and the Chicago area had a case of bad  gas.</p>
<p>In the first few hours after the tale of bad gas spread, customers  were having a hard time getting an actual BP representative on the  phone, much less someone who would have the skill to address the  situation. We must say since that point, the company has been trying to  get a better handle on the tainted gas, as well as launching a web site  for consumers with issues.</p>
<p>In the latest statement from a company spokesman, BP handed down the  numbers of 200 retail outlets that were supplied with off-specification  regular-grade gasoline, aka the stuff you&#8217;d likely fill up with, as well  as 20 sites in the Milwaukee area:</p>
<p>The company continues to go through its shipping records  and is contacting retailers who may have loaded tanker trucks with the  off-specification fuel and is replacing it with on-specification  product.</p>
<p>This fuel, sourced from BP’s Whiting, Indiana and Milwaukee,  Wisconsin gasoline storage terminals, contained a higher than normal  level of polymeric residue, which can lead to hard starting and other  drivability issues.</p>

<p>Go there and read. More tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well many of us like cooking with natural gas, and in a dramatically reduced energy environment absent hydrocarbons biofuels will make this possible. I do not believe they should be used in our transportation ground fleet and obviously air travel will have to be banned. Really burning wood or other things like dung would also have to be banned. Solar cookers can help in that. Still the use of biofuels is a closed system, first absorbing carbon then releasing it so it is carbon neutral.</p>

<p>In the home remodeling <a href="http://www.masterremodelersinc.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=61"><strong>Design and Planning</strong></a> process you make decisions about how green you want to go.  &#8220;Lite  green&#8221; home remodeling could mean simply better insulation and doors and  windows.  Or low flow showerheads and strategically planted shade  trees. Maybe add bamboo floors, recycled-content counter tops, and low  VOC paint. &#8220;Deep green&#8221; could mean solar, a geothermal heat pump or  complete energy independence.</p>
<h4>Home energy audits</h4>
<p>A great place to start your decision-making is with a <a href="http://masterremodelersinc.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=55&amp;Itemid=63"><strong>home energy audit</strong></a> to determine your home’s current energy efficiency.  We offer three  different levels of audits plus other ancillary tests to choose from.  For most homes, the greatest energy leaks are in floors, walls and  ceilings.  Leaky ductwork follows, and then heating and cooling systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let us put aside the fact militaries themselves are a huge waste of money. It is estimated that for every 1 $$$ the US for instance spends on a bullet they get 75 cents in return. That is just if it sits on the shelf. If it is used of course it is worth nothing. Not to mention that lavishing spending on militaries brought Empires from the Egypt to the Soviet Union&#8217;s down. But the USA&#8217;s Military wastes energy like there is no tomorrow. The worst offenders of course are the Airforce and the Navy. The Airforce in particular spews kerosene byproducts into the upper atmosphere where they do the most harm and the Navy because they burn warm asphalt at sea. Not to mention the nuclear issues both as weapons and power sources. But think about our main battle tank. It is as big as a modest 2 story house and it runs on diesel. So the idea that they want to go to zero energy use is great. But I got my doubts.</p>

<h2>U.S. Army Launches Plan to Make All Military Bases Net Zero</h2>
<p>Posted  by <a title="Posts by Ggw Admin" href="http://globalgreenworld.org/?page_id=169&amp;uid=1">Ggw Admin</a> on Apr 19, 2011 in <a title="View all posts in Blog" rel="category" href="http://globalgreenworld.org/?cat=85">Blog</a> | <a title="Comment on U.S. Army Launches Plan to Make All Military Bases Net Zero" href="http://globalgreenworld.org/?p=736#respond">0 comments</a></p>

<p>Over the past couple of years, the U.S. Army has announced several  initiatives ranging from solar-powered tents for troops to  hydrogen-powered tanks, however this is their most ambitious program  yet. With the help of the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable  Energy  Laboratory (NREL), the U.S. Army is aiming to have all Army  installations across the country be net zero.</p>
<p><a href="http://inhabitat.com/u-s-army-launches-plan-to-make-all-military-bases-net-zero/usmilitary/"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://globalgreenworld.org/wp-content/plugins/rss-poster/cache/563ba_USmilitary-75x75.jpg" alt="" width="75" height="75" /></a></p>

<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://globalgreenworld.org/wp-content/plugins/rss-poster/cache/df30c_USmilitary3-537x330.jpg" alt="Army Vision for Net Zero, Fort Bliss, net zero, renewable energy, U.S. Army, U.S. Military, Waste Reduction, water conservation" width="537" height="330" /></p>
<p>With funds from the DOE’s Federal Energy Management Program  (FEMP), the “Army Vision  for Net Zero” program will aim to meet  mandates to reduce energy as a result of  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/2009fedleader_eo_rel.pdf">Executive Order 13514</a>.  The order calls for all new  buildings to be net zero energy by 2030,  and it dictates a 30 percent reduction in water use and a 50 percent  reduction in waste that goes to landfills. On top of that, the National  Defense Authorization Act also mandates that the Army produce or acquire  25 percent of its energy from renewables by 2025.</p>
<p>“The first priority is less,” Assistant Secretary of the Army for   Installations, Energy  Environment Katherine Hammack said. “If you  use  less energy, you don’t have to buy as much – or you don’t have to  make  as much from alternative energy sources or renewable energy  sources. So  if you look at energy, that is a focus on energy efficiency.  If you’re  talking about water, then that’s water conservation. Or even  if you’re  talking about waste, that’s reducing the amount of waste we  have in  the steam.”</p>
<p>The program already has a poster child in the form of Fort Bliss. The  military base boasts solar daylighting in the dining facility,  warehouse and gym, energy-efficient windows, utility monitoring and  control for heating and air-conditioning systems in approximately 70  buildings, and plans to increase the on-site hybrid  waste-to-energy/concentrating solar power plant from 90 to 140  megawatts. The City of El Paso has committed to provide 1 million tons  per year of municipal solid waste, which will be transformed into energy  by the base.</p>
<p>“The Army’s net zero vision is a holistic approach to addressing   energy, water, and waste at Army installations,” Kingery said. “We look   at net zero as a force multiplier for the Army that will help us  steward  our resources and manage our costs.”</p>
<p>Considering that defense is a massive cause of national debt,  the  plan serves two purposes – reduced spending and “greening” national  security. If the military can get on board with renewable energy, it  makes you wonder why other areas of government are having such trouble.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember when your mom used to say, &#8220;Clean your plate. There are children in the world who are starving.&#8221;? Well now it is save the world kind of stuff. Wasting food wastes huge amounts of energy. This brief article below sums it up nicely. Please click on the authors name to see more of this authors work.</p>
<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2010/08/03/theres-more-energy-i.html">http://boingboing.net/2010/08/03/theres-more-energy-i.html</a></p>
<p><a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/08/03/theres-more-energy-i.html">There&#8217;s more energy in wasted food than there is in the Gulf of Mexico</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/author/maggie-koerth-baker/">Maggie Koerth-Baker </a> at  8:42 PM Tuesday, Aug  3, 2010</p>
<p>Recently, while doing some research on the carbon footprint of food, I <a href="http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/06/060413.diet.shtml">ran across some studies </a>that reported Americans ate, on average, 3774 calories of food each day.</p>
<p>Something about that smelled funny to me.</p>
<p>Sure, Americans eat a lot. But 3774 calories a day? I have family  members who subsist almost solely off fried meat and various sorts of  potatoes and I&#8217;m not convinced that even they hit that number on a  regular basis. When I took my questions to the researchers, I found out  that my hunch was correct. Americans aren&#8217;t, technically, eating an  average of 3774 calories per day. This figure is calculated by looking  at food produced, divided by the number of Americans. It assumes we&#8217;re  eating all that, but, in reality, according to environmental scientist <a href="http://www.bard.edu/academics/faculty/faculty.php?action=details&amp;id=2436">Gidon Eshel</a> we really only eat about 2800 calories per day. That whopping 3774 includes both what we eat—and what we waste.</p>
<p>And what we waste—not just at home, but from the farm field, to the  grocery store, to our Tupperware containers full of moldy leftovers—is a  big deal.</p>
<p>We use a lot of energy producing, transporting, processing, storing and cooking food we don&#8217;t eat. About <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es100310d">2150 trillion kilojoules </a>worth a year, according to a recent study. <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727712.700-us-food-waste-worth-more-than-offshore-drilling.html">That&#8217;s more kilojoules than the United States could produce in biofuels</a>. And it&#8217;s more than we already produce in all the oil and gas extracted annually from the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Reducing that waste requires both changes in the way we eat at home,  and systematic changes that address waste at every part of the food  cycle. Right now, I&#8217;ve talked to a lot of researchers who can identify  the problem, but don&#8217;t have a lot of suggestions for concrete solutions.  I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re out there, though, and I&#8217;ll report back as I track  them down.</p>

<h1>Pump Some Seriousness Into Energy Policy</h1>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></p>
<div id="byline">By Charles Krauthammer</div>
<p>Friday, November 11, 2005</p>
<p>Thank God for $3.50 gasoline. True, we had it for only a brief, shining  moment, and there is not much good to be said about the catastrophic  hurricanes that caused it. But the price was already inexorably climbing  as a result of 2.3 billion Chinese and Indians industrializing. Their  increased demand is what brought us to the energy knife&#8217;s edge and makes  us so acutely vulnerable to supply disruptions.</p>
<p>Yet, the Senate is attacking the problem by hauling oil executives to  hearings on &#8220;price gouging.&#8221; Even by Senate standards, the cynicism here  is breathtaking. Everyone knows what the problem really is. It&#8217;s  Economics 101: increasing demand and precariously tight supply.</p>
<p>Yet for three decades we have done criminally little about it.  Conservatives argued for more production, liberals argued for more  conservation and each side blocked the other&#8217;s remedies &#8212; when even a  child can see that we need both:</p>
<p><em>Demand</em> . Just yesterday we were paying $3.50 a gallon at the pump  and were ready to pay $4 or $5 if necessary. No blessing has ever come  more disguised. Now that we have lived with $3.50 gasoline, $3 seems far  less outrageous than, say, a year ago. We have a unique but fleeting  opportunity to permanently depress demand by locking in higher gasoline  prices. Put a floor at $3. Every penny that the price goes under $3  should be recaptured in a federal gas tax so that Americans pay $3 at  the pump no matter how low the world price goes.</p>
<p>Why is this a good idea? It is the simplest way to induce conservation.  People will alter their buying habits. It was the higher fuel prices of  the 1970s and early &#8217;80s that led to more energy-efficient cars and  appliances &#8212; which induced such restraint on demand that the world  price of oil ultimately fell through the floor. By 1986 oil was $11 a  barrel. Then we got profligate and resumed our old habits, and oil is  now around $60. Surprise.</p>
<p>The worst part is that much of this $60 goes overseas to foreigners who  wish us no good: Wahhabi Saudi princes who subsidize terrorists; Hugo  Chavez, the mini-Mussolini of the Southern Hemisphere; and (through the  fungibility of oil) the nuclear-hungry, death-to-America Iranian  mullahs. This is insanity. It makes infinitely more sense to reduce  consumption, drive the world price down and let the premium we force  ourselves to pay at the pump (which begins the conservation cycle) go to  the U.S. Treasury. If the price drops to $2, plow that $1 tax right  back into the American economy by immediately reducing, say, Social  Security or income taxes.</p>

<p>Do you remember the furor over drilling for oil in the Alaska  National Wildlife Refuge a few years back? The whole country was up in  arms. At various times some 50 to 60 percent of Americans favored  drilling in the area as they were told this would result in lower gas  prices.</p>
<p>Last week the USGS lowered its estimate of the amount of oil that  could be extracted from the region all the way from 10 billion  barrels down to less than one billion, making drilling in the  area uneconomical. By the way, the amount of crude being pumped down the  Alaskan pipeline now has fallen from 2 million barrels a day (b/d) when  the pipeline first opened back in the 1970&#8217;s to about 600,000 b/d in  recent weeks. The trouble is that when the flow of oil falls below  a quantity estimated to be 200-300,000 b/d (some say 500,000) the line  will have to be closed as there will simply not be enough hot oil  being sent down the pipeline to keep it from freezing in winter.</p>
<p>Last week an organization in California, The Post Carbon Institute, released a new book, &#8220;<em>The Post Carbon </em><em>Reader</em>,&#8221;  which draws a much broader picture of the serious issues facing  mankind. With 30 authors, each specializing in some aspect of  the multiple troubles we face, the scope of the book touches on nearly  every aspect of our civilization that is out of balance, unsustainable,  and headed for a fall. The basic proposition of the book is that the  world has reached the limits of growth in terms of  its population, economic activity, and the ability of the atmosphere to  absorb more carbon emissions. Either the world&#8217;s peoples must transform  themselves into a sustainable number living in a sustainable manner or  there will be many dire consequences right up to the possibility  that the human race itself could become extinct. Clearly, this is  serious stuff.</p>
<blockquote><p>As long as a problem is perceived as being decades, or even a few years away, it is not a concern.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some hold that our sustainability problem started when we first  started planting crops and domesticating animals 10,000 years ago. This  thesis says if we had stuck with hunting and gathering as a race we  would have been able to sustain our act indefinitely, but then we would  never have had enough surplus energy to learn reading &amp; writing,  and to build cities, the Internet and space ships. Our immediate  problem, however, started in earnest with the industrial revolution  about 200 years ago when we first started digging up prodigious  quantities of coal and feeding it into steam engines. It wasn&#8217;t long  before we struck oil and the rest is history. The world&#8217;s population  went from an estimated 5 or 10 million when we first started farming, to  a billion when we started serious coal digging, to about 7 billion  today. We also got incredibly richer in terms of material goods and  could sure get around much faster.</p>

<p><!-- Story intro -->Paris &#8212; 								 			 		 		 		 			 				If you&#8217;re looking for a comprehensive resource for renewable energy  installation figures, look no further: The Renewables Global Status  report was released last week, and it provides a great snapshot of where  and how renewables are being developed around the world.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/REN21_GSR_2010_full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The report</a> was released by the Renewable Energy  Policy Network for the 21st Century, also known as REN21, and it  provides an upbeat picture for renewables, despite the murky outlook for  the global economy.</p>
<p>The report was originally released in 2005. Since then, solar PV has  grown by 60 percent annually, wind by 27 percent, solar hot water by 19  percent, according to the authors. In 2009, renewables made up more than  half of investment in global power generation. And that&#8217;s with  depressed oil and gas prices, lenders being very choosy about projects  and individual consumers facing their own financial problems. Total  investment in the industry was about $150 billion last year.</p>
<p>Other than the stellar investment figures during a slow year for most  other industries, there&#8217;s not much surprising in the 2009 report. The  industry continues to move along – increasingly in developing countries –  driven largely by robust public policy. Where policy lacks, investment  does too.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important trend is the role of China in the global  renewable energy market. According to the report, the country produces  about 40 precent of solar PV panels, 30 percent of wind turbines and 77  percent of solar hot water systems globally. The Chinese presence will  impact investment decisions of companies as they work to compete with  “The China Price,” and decide where to locate manufacturing facilities.</p>
<p>Many organizations like the International Energy Agency and the  Energy Information Administration put together yearly figures on  renewables. But none do it quite as comprehensively and clearly as the  REN21 folks do. It&#8217;s worth keeping around as a go-to resource for  figures on the industry.</p>
<p>Here are some other highlights taken straight from the report about  the various renewables sectors:</p>

<h1>Dick Gephardt&#8217;s Spectacular Sellout</h1>
<h2><strong>By</strong> <cite><a href="http://www.thenation.com/directory/bios/sebastian_jones">Sebastian Jones</a></cite></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20091019"> This article appeared in the October 19, 2009 edition of <cite>The Nation</cite>.<br />
</a></p>
<h3>September 30, 2009</h3>
<p>In March, months after the government gave an unprecedented $85 billion to AIG, the insurance giant released a list of counterparties, exposing some of the world&#8217;s top financial institutions as the real recipients of the bailout. First among its peers, Goldman Sachs got a whopping $12.9 billion, despite having claimed in September to be insulated from AIG&#8217;s troubles. Based on these revelations, Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings, who had dogged the financial industry since the crisis began, told his staff to prepare a letter calling for an investigation.</p>
<p>Two Congressional staffers familiar with the matter told <em>The Nation</em> that a draft was circulated to House members on March 23. Within hours, Cummings&#8217;s office had received a phone call from a lobbying firm hired by Goldman Sachs, making an &#8220;insistent but polite&#8221; request for a meeting. Cummings, intending to send the letter regardless, granted the audience, and so it was that top Goldman executives like president Gary Cohn and CFO David Viniar arrived the next day. They brought someone else too, a big-name Democratic politician with serious populist credibility: Dick Gephardt.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>But the real issue here is pollution.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/31633524/the_climate_killers/9" target="_self" rel="noopener">http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/31633524/the_climate_killers/9</a></p>
<div>
<p><span>The Arm Twister</span><br />
<span>Dick Gephardt</span><br />
<span>CEO, Gephardt Group</span></p>
<p>The former House majority leader now uses his considerable political clout as a lobbyist for Peabody Energy, the world&#8217;s largest private-sector coal company. Working behind the scenes on Capitol Hill, Gephardt has emerged as the most credible proponent of &#8220;clean coal&#8221; — an imaginary technology being touted by the industry as an alternative to limits on carbon pollution. (&#8220;Clean coal is like healthy cigarettes,&#8221; says Al Gore. &#8220;It does not exist.&#8221;) In July, Gephardt was the keynote speaker at the Clean Coal Technology Conference, an honor bestowed after he helped win $1 billion in stimulus funding for FutureGen, a &#8220;clean coal&#8221; boondoggle promoted by Peabody. That&#8217;s a significant return on the $1.7 million that Peabody and the FutureGen Industrial Alliance have invested in Gephardt Group&#8217;s services since 2007. His firm also lobbies for Ameren, the nation&#8217;s fourth-dirtiest utility, as well as for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The head of Peabody&#8217;s Washington office, Fred Palmer, marvels at the access the ex-congressman still enjoys on Capitol Hill: &#8220;I can meet with a lot of people, but I&#8217;m Fred Palmer. He&#8217;s Dick Gephardt.&#8221;</p>

<p>So to Dick we must say &#8211; Smoke gets in our eyes:</p>
