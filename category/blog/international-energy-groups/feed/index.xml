										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This method of generation will only go up from here. But here is something most people don&#8217;t consider, at sea drilling for oil and wind farms are incompatible. You can not drill anywhere near wind turbines because of the possibility of oil spills. There is a good chance those spills would ignite. That is not the case with other spills or even explosions and fires. Because they are easily put out. But when you have an electrical source, those fires are guaranteed and would be difficult to extinguish. So all you have to do to stop off shore drilling is build wind farms. Mark my words, when some hotshot wind person builds a wind farm over a proven oil deposit, oil is dead.</p>

<p>After years of delays, the U.S. offshore wind industry is finally gaining momentum, with new projects being planned along the Atlantic coast. So far, the Trump administration seems to be regarding offshore wind as one form of renewable energy it can support.</p>

<h5>This summer, the Norwegian energy company, <a href="https://www.statoil.com/">Statoil</a>, will send a vessel to survey a triangular slice of federal waters about 15 miles south of Long Island, where the company is planning to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/statoil-names-new-york-offshore-wind-project-empire-wind-300542071.html">construct a wind farm</a> that could generate up to 1.5 gigawatts of electricity for New York City and Long Island — enough to power roughly 1 million homes. Construction on the “Empire Wind” project, with scores of wind turbines generating electricity across 79,000 acres of leased federal waters, is scheduled to begin in 2023, with construction completed in 2025.</h5>
<p>Farther south, 27 miles off the coast of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, <a href="http://www.avangridrenewables.us/">Avangrid Renewables</a>, an Oregon-based company, has already begun planning for a major wind energy farm on 122,000 acres of federal waters, a project that could eventually generate 1.5 gigawatts of electricity.</p>
<p>And about 10 miles off the New Jersey coast, between Atlantic City and Cape May, Danish clean-energy giant <a href="https://orsted.com/en">Ørsted</a>, which has a large portfolio of offshore wind farms across Europe, <a href="http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/breaking/atlantic-city-offshore-wind-developer-all-in-on-green-energy/article_c6e911e9-de6c-5d4e-8a55-525295ce6f03.html">is talking</a> with local officials, securing state permits, and doing seafloor surveys on a 160,000-acre site, where it plans to build its 1–gigawatt <a href="http://oceanwind.com/en/About-Ocean-wind">Ocean Wind</a> project. Company officials say they are hopeful that the wind farm will come online between 2020 and 2025.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia has a plan to wean its economy off oil. In the biggest sign of what the future of the Gulf state would look like, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, has signed a memorandum of understanding with Japanese multinational Softbank to build 200 GW of solar power by 2030 at a cost of $200 billion.</p>
<p>These are eye-popping numbers. If built, that solar-power plant will be about 200 times the size of the biggest solar plant operating today. It would more than triple Saudi Arabia’s capacity to produce electricity, from about 77 GW today.</p>
<p>With current technology, solar panels capable of generating 200 GW would likely cover 5,000 sq km—an area larger than the the world’s largest cities.</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">Cape Town is in the unenviable situation of being the first major city in the modern era to face the threat of running out of drinking water.</p>
<p>However, the plight of the drought-hit South African city is just one extreme example of a problem that experts have long been warning about &#8211; water scarcity.</p>
<p>Despite covering about 70% of the Earth&#8217;s surface, water, especially drinking water, is not as plentiful as one might think. Only 3% of it is fresh.</p>
<p>Over one billion people lack access to water and another 2.7 billion find it scarce for at least one month of the year. A 2014 survey of the world&#8217;s 500 largest cities estimates that one in four are in a situation of &#8220;water stress&#8221;</p>
<p>According to UN-endorsed projections, global demand for fresh water will exceed supply by 40% in 2030, thanks to a combination of climate change, human action and population growth.</p>

<h1 class="headline node-title">Severe water shortages around the world: Why the taps run dry</h1>
<div class="label-inline">Published</div>
<p>Feb 13, 2018, 7:30 pm SGT</p>
<p>PARIS (AFP) &#8211; The world has abundant freshwater but it is unevenly distributed and under increasing pressure, UN agencies say, as highlighted by the severe shortages in Cape Town.</p>
<h4>WATER, WATER &#8216;EVERYWHERE&#8217;</h4>
<p>More than 97 per cent of the planet&#8217;s water is salty, most of it in the oceans and seas, but there is also a good supply of freshwater.</p>
<p>Every year around 42.8 trillion cubic metres of renewable freshwater circulates as rain, surface water or groundwater, according to the UN&#8217;s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).</p>
<p>This equals 16,216 litres per person per day &#8211; four times the amount required in the United States, for example, for personal and domestic consumption, industry and agriculture.</p>
<p>Depending on diet and lifestyle, a person needs between 2,000 and 5,000 litres of water a day to produce their food and meet their drinking and sanitation requirements, the FAO says.</p>
<p>About 60 per cent of the planet&#8217;s freshwater reserves is locked in the Antarctic.</p>

<p>They don&#8217;t even agree on how much water we have. Go there and read a lot. More next week.</p>

<h1>Worst-hit reactor at Fukushima may be easiest to clean up</h1>
<div class="author">By MARI YAMAGUCHI Associated Press</div>

<p>OKUMA, Japan (AP) — High atop Fukushima&#8217;s most damaged nuclear reactor, the final pieces of a jelly-roll shaped cover are being put in place to seal in highly radioactive dust.</p>
<p>Blown apart by a hydrogen explosion in 2011 after an earthquake and tsunami hit Japan&#8217;s Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, reactor Unit 3 is undergoing painstaking construction ahead of a milestone that is the first step toward dismantling the plant.</p>
<p>The operating floor — from where new fuel rods used to be lowered into the core — has been rebuilt and if all goes as planned, huge cranes will begin removing 566 sets of still-radioactive fuel rods from a storage pool just below it later this year.</p>
<p>It has taken seven years just to get this far, but now the real work of cleaning up the Tokyo Electric Power Co. plant can begin.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you compare it with mountain climbing, we&#8217;ve only been preparing to climb. Now, we finally get to actually start climbing,&#8221; said Daisuke Hirose, an official at the plant&#8217;s decommissioning and decontamination unit.</p>

<h1>Feature: China and the New Energy Economy</h1>
<div class="clr"></div>
<p class="commondate">London (Platts)&#8211;31 Oct 2017 1239 pm EDT/1639 GMT</p>
<p>There is an increasingly inescapable sense that an energy transition of enormous proportions is taking place. The number of &#8216;bans&#8217; announced on Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles is growing, even if governments are placing them relatively far out on the political horizon.</p>
<p>More and more car manufacturers are taking note and shifting R&amp;D spending into Electric Vehicles (EVs), a move which has profound implications for the development curves, and thus future cost, of EVs versus ICE vehicles.</p>
<p>In October, US automaker General Motors said that it would launch two new pure electric models in 2018 and a further 18 by 2023.</p>
<p>Its competitor Ford announced the creation of a new internal team to &#8220;think big and move fast&#8221; in order to accelerate the electrification of its auto production. Both are some way behind their European counterparts.</p>
<p>It is not hard to see why such decisions are being made now. While the number of EVs on the road remains just a fraction of the total parc, global sales are growing by about 40% year-on-year, making EVs the biggest growth story in the auto market in decades.</p>
<p>And, if governments are going to regulate against ICE vehicles and subsidize EVs, thereby changing the consumer choices which otherwise might be made, then what other path is there to tread?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I will say this once and only once. If nukes are a really bad idea on the Earth, then they are  a really really bad idea for Mars. They are only on or off. That is functional or not, and if it is NOT you are dead. If they go out of control no good can come of it. The first and foremost reason has always been, What do you do with the waste?.</p>

<p>As NASA makes plans to one day send humans to Mars, one of the key technical gaps the agency is working to fill is how to <a href="https://www.space.com/30692-nasa-real-martians-tech-videos.html">provide enough power on the Red Planet’s surface</a> for fuel production, habitats and other equipment. One option: small nuclear fission reactors, which work by splitting uranium atoms to generate heat, which is then converted into electric power.</p>
<p>NASA’s technology development branch has been funding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fYdLsSTf-M">a project called Kilopower</a> for three years, with the aim of demonstrating the system at the Nevada National Security Site near Las Vegas. Testing is due to start in September and end in January 2018.</p>
<p>The last time NASA tested a fission reactor was during the 1960s&#8217; <a href="http://etec.energy.gov/Operations/Major_Operations/SNAP_Overview.html">Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power</a>, or SNAP, program, which developed two types of nuclear power systems. The first system — radioisotope thermoelectric generators, or RTGs — taps heat released from the natural decay of a radioactive element, such as plutonium. RTGs have powered dozens of space probes over the years, including the Curiosity rover currently exploring Mars. [<a href="https://www.space.com/13702-nuclear-generators-rtg-power-nasa-planetary-probes-infographic.html">Nuclear Generators Power NASA Deep Space Probes (Infographic)</a>]</p>
<p>The second technology developed under SNAP was an atom-splitting fission reactor. SNAP-10A was the first — and so far, only — U.S. nuclear power plant to operate in space.</p>

<h2>Temperature Increase</h2>
<div class="g-fulltext">“Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to <strong>pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C</strong> above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.”</div>

<div class="g-comment">
<div class="g-credit">Justin Gillis, climate science reporter:</div>
<div class="g-commentary">This agreement adopts a more ambitious target for limiting global warming than in the past by mentioning 1.5 degrees Celsius as part of the concrete goal to stay well below 2 degrees. If that were to be actually achieved, it would likely ward off some of the most severe effects of climate change. For example, although we don’t know the exact temperature, there is a trigger point at which the whole Greenland ice sheet and the West Antarctic ice sheet will melt. There is a chance that staying below 2 degrees Celsius would avoid that trigger point, and an even better chance if we stay below 1.5 degrees.</div>

<h2>Preservation of Forests</h2>
<div class="g-fulltext">“Parties are encouraged to take action to implement and support, including through results-based payments, the existing framework as set out in related guidance and decisions already agreed under the Convention for: policy approaches and positive incentives for activities relating to <strong>reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests</strong> and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries; and alternative policy approaches, such as joint mitigation and adaptation approaches for the integral and sustainable management of forests, while reaffirming the importance of incentivizing, as appropriate, non-carbon benefits associated with such approaches.”</div>

<h1>What&#8217;s New for Renewable Energy</h1>
<p>Energy drives social and economic development. In the past, the discovery of oil triggered an unprecedented industrial revolution that had significant impacts on our quality of life. A single litre of oil provides as many calories as two to twenty weeks of human labour, enough energy to fuel our growing industries, heat our homes, and get us from point A to point B quickly.</p>
<hr />
<p>However, with an alarming scarcity of fossil fuels and growing energy demands on the horizon, especially for emerging economies, the search for sustainable means of production is not only imperative for the preservation of the environment—it is also becoming highly lucrative. That is why renewable energy is receiving more and more attention from governments and businesses. There is talk of a new industrial revolution, one that is all about green energy.</p>
<p>Since the Kyoto Protocol, most countries have increased the proportion of their budget invested in energy with the potential for long-term sustainability. We can already see results; even in 2006, 18.6% of the world&#8217;s electricity came from renewable resources. Of that percentage, hydraulic energy (hydroelectric dams, underwater turbines, tidal power plants, etc.) constituted 89%, biomass constituted 5.7%, and wind power, geothermal energy, and solar power constituted 3.5%, 1.7%, and 0.2%, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>This Huge Wind Turbine Floating on Water Is Fukushima&#8217;s Energy Solution</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bryan Lufkin</strong><br />

<p class="first-text" data-textannotation-id="0647ba299f3697a085640fc42b7f7f84">A mere 12 miles from the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant will soon sit a 620-foot, 1,500-ton windmill atop a 5,000-ton podium. It’ll be <a href="http://asia.nikkei.com/Tech-Science/Tech/World-s-largest-floating-wind-turbine-nearly-complete-in-Fukushima" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the biggest floating wind turbine</a> on Earth, and it could usher in a new age of green energy for a region largely fed up with nuclear energy.</p>
<p data-textannotation-id="0d63de0e44f6f9e5413abd4a12d7fee3">The turbine, <a href="http://www.fukushima-forward.jp/english/news_release/news150622.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">completed Monday</a>, will generate up to 7 megawatts of electricity, making it Japan’s most powerful wind turbine, and the most powerful floating turbine in the world. That’s good news for Japan, a country that’s shut down nuclear power plants in the wake of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami and subsequent meltdown.</p>
<p data-textannotation-id="dee2c33ee8730f0e8cd383bceb73ea49">The beast of a turbine sports three 270-foot-long blades and is built to stand against winds nearly 200 mph. It’ll be part of a wind farm that will include three turbines total, and will be stationed in the Pacific in the coming months. One is already in place in the ocean—that smaller one generates 2 megawatts of electricity.</p>
<p data-textannotation-id="6388ab31c9d9fe11e54a04f4edc20d04">The $401 million Fukushima wind farm project is a government-sponsored collaboration among 11 companies and research orgs, like Mitsubishi, Hitachi, and the University of Tokyo.</p>
