										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know it has been awhile since I did a residential post. I know this started out as a blog about residential energy needs and services. You know, energy efficient roofs, HVAC equipment and other such stuff. But years ago, I got off on energy related environmental stuff and then eventually Global Warming. Then anti-Nuclear stuff. Finally just raw Environmental stuff like obnoxious polluting and horrible deaths. Well today a gentleman named Chris Winters reached out and touched me so I am touching him back, so to speak. As always, I can vouch for his tips because they are somewhat general, but anything specific he is pitching I can not (For instance AC controllers &#8211; which his company sells). Also I may have put up this as an addenda to any earlier piece, so if i did forgive me.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cielowigle.com/blog/energy-saving-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.cielowigle.com/blog/energy-saving-tips/</a></p>
<p>No matter what the season, energy usage tends to increase one way or another. With long running air conditioning and increased wash cycles of sweaty laundry in summer, to high heating usage and wash cycles of bulkier laundry in winter, we simply cannot operate without electricity.</p>
<p>We can be extremely energy efficient and follow energy saving tips and tricks to ingrain some environmentally friendly habits.</p>
<p>Following energy saving tips is essential to lower your costs, but it is also important to decrease your ecological footprint.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/2020/08/generation-green-is-leading-the-sustainability-agenda/">millennials and Gen Z nicknamed “generation green”</a>, there is a strong focus on energy saving, and rightly so. However, global warming is rising more rapidly than ever, and the term ‘climate emergency’ is being used rather than climate change to highlight the situation’s intensity.</p>
<p>All industries such as <a href="https://www.cielowigle.com/blog/climate-change/">HVAC are revolutionizing their technology to act on climate change</a>. Since home appliances and devices are a major contributor to our energy consumption, utilizing smart devices such as smart thermostats or <a href="https://www.cielowigle.com/">smart controllers for air conditioners</a> can make a huge difference on your bills!</p>
<p>Let’s get right to it. Here are 21 energy saving tips that can easily help you decrease your energy consumption:</p>
<h2 id="h-1-use-energy-efficient-appliances">1. Use Energy Efficient Appliances</h2>
<p>Energy efficient appliances are specially designed to consume minimum energy to complete the same tasks that you’d perform with normal appliances.  In addition, some</p>

It remains highly transparent up to 89 degrees F (32 degrees Celsius), but beyond that, it becomes translucent like frosted glass. As a result, it reflects back up to 70 percent of the sun&#8217;s incoming heat, reducing interior temperatures and the load on your air conditioner.</p>

<p>To maximize heat blocking, the researchers inserted tiny water-filled spheres into a standard poly material. At temperatures starting around 85 degree F, the spheres start to shrink, squeezing out the liquid and forcing the poly fibers closer together. That gives the glass a frosted appearance, blocking 70 percent of the incoming heat while still letting a lot of visible light through.</p>
<p>Such films have been tried before but didn&#8217;t block heat that well. The MIT and Hong Kong teams realized that the water filled spheres needed to match the wavelength of infrared light responsible for most solar heating. After expanding the bubble size to 500 nanometers, the film became a much more effective heat-blocker.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Residential energy conservation has stagnated somewhat in the last 3 or 4 years. I do not know what the dampers are, whether it is price or attitude for instance. New houses are a lot more efficient but the efforts to improve existing housing stock have stalled. Here is an article about those latest techniques.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/Energy-Efficiency-and-Renewable-Programs/Residential/Emerging-Technologies-and-Accelerated-Commercialization.aspx">http://www.nyserda.ny.gov/Energy-Efficiency-and-Renewable-Programs/Residential/Emerging-Technologies-and-Accelerated-Commercialization.aspx</a></p>
<h1 id="content_0_hdrTitle">Emerging Technologies and Accelerated Commercialization (ETAC) in the Residential Sector</h1>
<p>Opportunities to achieve energy-efficiency gains in the residential sector beyond traditional building and retrofit techniques have been limited by underutilization of emerging technologies that are commercially-available, but face barriers to widespread adoption in the industry. Technologies and techniques such as solid state lighting, lighting controls, home energy management systems, smart-grid integration, micro-combined heat and power, and super insulation have proven benefits. But they have seen limited market adoption, due to obstacles such as upfront costs, consumer and builder awareness and the lack of infrastructure support, including activities such as supply chain development, sales training and installer certification.</p>
<p>The ETAC initiative seeks to address the barriers to market acceptance by facilitating in-field demonstrations and the subsequent technology transfers. Widespread, large-scale demonstrations will incorporate these technologies into energy-efficiency projects, where the savings potential will be monitored and validated. In parallel, other marketplace needs will be addressed, such as the development of a training curriculum for designers and specifiers, installer-certification standards, consumer-education materials, and maintenance processes. Following the demonstration period, results will be communicated to the marketplace via various means such as case studies, presentations, and webinars.</p>
<p>While this specific initiative is focused on emerging technologies in the residential sector, NYSERDA will also demonstrate emerging technologies for the multifamily and commercial/industrial sectors through parallel ETAC initiative</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes I know there are many things that are wrong about Las Vegas. People shouldn&#8217;t even be there in the first place. The rape of the river that no longer reaches the sea. The rape of the pristine desert and the death of many Native Americans. I lived there for a year and there is also the cheesy nature of the culture. But when they do something right, you got to give them credit.</p>

<h1>Nevada Energy Star Partners Demonstrate Peak Performance (Web Only)</h1>
<div>BY <a href="http://www.homeenergy.org/list/author/id/946">ANNETTE BUBAK</a></div>
<div>September 01, 2012</div>
<p>Las Vegas may appear balmy and inviting with its sparkling pools and  swaying palm trees, but those who live in Neon City know the truth: It’s  too cold in the winter and too hot in the summer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, hundreds of thousands of homes that were built during  an amazing 50 years of rapid growth in the Southwest do not incorporate  modern advances in energy performance to accommodate the wild swings of  desert climate. As temperatures climb to 110°F in the summer, many homes  leak large amounts of cooled air through gaps in ducts, roofs, windows,  and doors. And when the frigid north wind drops the temperature below  freezing in the winter, heated air escapes, leaving living rooms and  bedrooms uncomfortably cold and drafty. While Las Vegans know their  climate, they may not realize that they are paying to heat and cool the  great outdoors.</p>
<p>The dramatic temperature shifts in the high-desert climate make Las  Vegas an ideal place for homeowners who are looking to make their homes  more comfortable and to save substantially on their energy bills. Funded  in part by DOE’s Building America program, the Building America  Retrofit Alliance is working with the Nevada ENERGY STAR Partners–Green  Alliance (NESP–Green Alliance), and with Better Building Performance, a  Las Vegas company, to upgrade two typical homes top to bottom. Their  goal has been to show homeowners and remodelers how easy and effective  energy performance upgrades can be.</p>

<h1>Are PACE Financed Residential Energy Improvements Capitalized into Home Prices?</h1>
<div id="single-date">September 9, 2012</div>

<div>by <a title="View all posts by Matthew E. Kahn" rel="author" href="http://legalplanet.wordpress.com/author/mek1966/">Matthew E. Kahn</a></div>
<p>The FHFA believes that an unintended consequence of obtaining a PACE  loan is to increase the risk of mortgage default.  The FHFA’s  logic is  that if the green investments are not capitalized into home prices then  the home owner’s equity decreases as equity =  sales price – debt owed.    Under these assumptions, the green investment doesn’t raise the sales  price but does increase the debt owed. My recent research convinces me  that this pessimism is false.  Here is  <a href="http://legalplanet.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/letter_fhfa3.pdf">My letter to the FHFA.</a> Here is my July 2012 peer viewed paper on solar panel capitalization effects in San Diego and Sacramento   <a href="http://legalplanet.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dastrup-zivin-costa-and-kahn.pdf">dastrup-zivin-costa-and-kahn</a> .</p>
<p>We need more regulatory scholarship focused on empirical work and  hypothesis testing.  I have an incentive to say this because that is  what I do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, you can get a backhoe and dig a trench around your house for relatively cheap but, it really is a waste of time. Parging the walls first pretty much means coating the walls to make sure moisture does not get behind the insulation that you are going to put up. I suggest using a modern basement epoxy of some sort and I recommend rigid insulation after you have done that. Rigid is easier to work with and you can make the whole project into an adhesive affair where you adhere the furring strips to the epoxied walls and then you adhere the foam board (or whatever) to the furring strips. Boom, you are done unless you need to paint them for someone else in the house that hates the color of the &#8220;naked&#8221; board. You know who I mean. Like the article says as far as the vapor barrier placement you have to call your local building code people cause I got no idea,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.green-energy-efficient-homes.com/energy-efficient-basement.html">http://www.green-energy-efficient-homes.com/energy-efficient-basement.html</a></p>
<h4>Exterior wall insulation inside the walls</h4>
<p>Insulating outside your exterior walls is often too expensive or impractical in existing homes. You can insulate the inside of your basement walls but you may exacerbate the problems associated with moisture if you don&#8217;t do the job correctly.</p>
<p>Parging: If moisture is seeping into your walls, parge the masonry walls to seal any cracks and strengthen any weak or porous masonry. This will help prevent water from seeping in from outside.</p>
<p>Vapor barrier: Vapor barrier should be outside the insulation if you are in a hot climate and only cool your home; it should be on the inside if you are in a cold climate and are mainly heating your home. Consult your local city building permits department to find out what are the suggested or mandated insulation and vapor barrier configurations for energy efficient basements in your area.</p>
<p>Framing: If possible, leave a gap between your framing and the exterior walls, to prevent moisture from the masonry from causing wood rot in your framing. Use small spacers behind 2&#215;3 studs, rather than 2&#215;4 studs against the outside wall, and you&#8217;ll still have room to install the standard insulation for 2&#215;4, 16-inch-stud construction.</p>
<p>Insulation: If there is any likelihood of moisture getting into your basement, use a rigid foam insulation rather than batt or other fiber-based insulation. Moisture seeping through exterior walls will dampen the insulation and reduce its R value significantly within a few years, so you&#8217;ll start with an energy efficient basement and in a few years be losing as much heat to outside as before the renovation. Moisture will not have much effect on the R value of foam insulation. Buy the highest R value insulation you can &#8211; you can get an R value of 6 per inch in some insulating foam sheets. If you want both insulation and waterproofing, you could consider having Icynene insulation applied to exterior walls after framing but before drywall is installed.</p>
<h4>Other places you should insulate</h4>
<p>A couple of other important things to consider about basement insulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>In an older house, where a shower stall is already installed against an outside wall, check the insulation level behind the shower. A prior owner or contractor may have installed the shower without adequate insulation. If you are remodelling or can access the wall space behind it, inject foam insulation or otherwise upgrade the insulation. You&#8217;ll have more comfortable showers and you&#8217;ll cut down on overall heat loss.</li>
<li>Insulate the perimeter of your basement ceiling (an area called the &#8216;rim joists&#8217;), from the outside walls to about 16&#8243; to 24&#8243; from the outside walls, to prevent moisture from creeping in between the upstairs</li>
</ul>
<p>:}</p>
<p>In this case, go there and read a bunch. More tomorrow.</p>

<p>Five Models of Energy Efficiency: A Guide to Beautiful, Energy-Efficient Homes</p>
<p>Five US builders are being honored for their exceptional achievements in high performance building at the second annual BASF <a href="http://www.hgtvpro.com/hpro/green_building/article/0,3142,HPRO_27916_5942677,00.html">Builders Challenge</a> Awards.</p>
<p>Led by the U.S Department of Energy (DOE), the Builders  Challenge is working with homebuilders across America to build a new  generation of high-performance homes, working toward the ultimate goal  of providing cost-effective, net-zero energy homes by 2030  for all  Americans.</p>
<p>To qualify for the Builders Challenge, homes must meet at least a 70 on the <a href="http://www.hgtvpro.com/hpro/green_building/article/0,3142,HPRO_27916_5946464,00.html">EnergySmart Home Scale (E-Scale)</a> &#8212; which means they must use at least 30 percent less energy than a typical new home built to code.</p>
