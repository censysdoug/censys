			<p>The term was started in the &#8220;new build&#8221; industry but it has since migrated to the built environment as well. The general concept is that there is no such thing as TOO MUCH insulation in the residential market. It can provide living space that &#8220;sips&#8221; energy.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superinsulation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superinsulation</a></p>
<p>The term &#8220;superinsulation&#8221; was coined by Wayne Schick at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 1976 he was part of a team that developed a design called the &#8220;Lo-Cal&#8221; house, using computer simulations based on the climate of Madison, Wisconsin. The house was never built, but some of its design features influenced later builders.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>If I am not mistaken he was getting his concepts from those used in much colder climates, like Sweden and Denmark where they value their resources&#8230;actually where they value life and family in general.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12917595.400-the-house-that-came-in-from-the-cold-houses-designed-withenergy-efficiency-in-mind-are-more-pleasant-to-live-in-less-harmful-totheenvironmentand-need-not-be-expensive-to-build-.html">http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12917595.400-the-house-that-came-in-from-the-cold-houses-designed-withenergy-efficiency-in-mind-are-more-pleasant-to-live-in-less-harmful-totheenvironmentand-need-not-be-expensive-to-build-.html</a></p>
<h2>The house that came in from the cold:</h2>
<h2>Houses designed with energy efficiency in</h2>
<h2>mind are more pleasant to live in, less</h2>
<h2>harmful to the environment-and need not be expensive to build.</h2>
<p>09 March 1991</p>
<p>Buildings use about half the energy industrialized countries consume. Much of it could be saved, conserving resources and reducing our contribution to global warming. Energy efficient housing has already been tried and tested in several countries, with some success.</p>
<p>Between 1975 and 1977, building researchers and designers in North America and Scandinavia pioneered a radically new approach to reducing heat loss from buildings, now called &#8216;superinsulation&#8217;. Conventional buildings lose most of their heat by simple air leakage. Superinsulated buildings are firmly sealed against draughts, with a controllable ventilation system to provide fresh air in winter. In Sweden, all new houses must by law have fewer than three air changes per hour, tested at a pressure difference between inside and outside of 50 pascals. In superinsulated houses this figure is often brought below 1 air change per hour, while in a typical British house there are 10 air changes per hour under the same conditions (see Table 1).</p>
<p>By the late 1980s, there were more than 100 000 superinsulated dwellings in North America and Scandinavia, where most houses are built of timber. But the problems of adapting these techniques to houses built of brick and concrete prevented superinsulation being applied on any large scale in Europe until the early 1980s. Most of Britain&#8217;s houses-new and old-are put together with little regard to energy efficiency . In the rest of Europe, however, the technique is beginning to take root.</p>
<p>The Netherlands now has more than 1000 superinsulated houses.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>The important thing to remember here is that these are not just superinsulated living spaces, they are TIGHT spaces as well. Just throwing insulation at the problem is a good thing but tight construction techniques are important too. Little things like caulking in existing homes can accomplish much the same thing. Another thing to pull out of the construction &#8220;speak&#8221; above. It takes 3 turnovers in the atmosphere in a living space to keep humans alive. Also in tight spaces smells and moisture can build up so adequate ventalation is critical as is a carbon monoxide/dioxide detector.</p>
<p>Also note that most of these houses contain backup, many times &#8220;unconventional&#8221; heating sources. Though the idea was that all of the cooking, human waste heat, water heating etc. would handle heating in the winter.  And that ventaltion could handle the cooling in the summer. Most buyers wanted backup heating and cooling as a psychological reassurance. Often times a geothermal heat pump served as a device that could supply both heating and cooling.</p>
<p>Then there is also the Passive House movement:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_solar_building_design">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_solar_building_design</a></p>
<p><strong>Passive solar buildings</strong> aim to maintain interior thermal comfort throughout the sun&#8217;s daily and annual cycles whilst reducing the requirement for active heating and cooling systems. Passive solar building design is one part of green building design, and does not include active systems such as mechanical ventilation or photovoltaics, nor does it include life cycle analysis.</p>

<h1><strong>Passive Building</strong></h1>
<p>From the energy-saving point of view, passive buildings are most advanced, and when considering the involved technology they can be constructed almost anywhere</p>

<h1>Basic Ideas in</h1>
<h1>Passive Solar Buildings</h1>
<p><strong>Natural Forces At Work For You</strong><br>
In any climate, a building can make use of free heat from the sun. An elementary passive solar heating concept is letting in the sunshine with windows, then keeping the resulting heat inside with insulation and thermal mass. The goal in passive solar building is the optimal balance of mass, glass, and insulation for a particular site and house design. A well-designed solar home in Oregon&#8217;s Williamette Valley can get up to 30 percent of its winter heating needs met at no cost.<br>
<strong><br>
Passive Cooling</strong><br>
Passive cooling requires correct placement of windows, proper shading of windows by trees or constructed shade, light-colored roofs and walls to reflect heat, nighttime ventilation, and thermal mass to prevent overheating in hot, sunny weather. Large west-facing glass areas usually present a risk of unwanted summer afternoon heat gains. Air-conditioning is unnecessary in the maritime Northwest, if the house is properly designed.<br>
<strong><br>
Choose The Right Building Site</strong><br>
The more southern exposure, the better the site for passive solar. A steep north-facing slope, or large trees or other buildings in the wrong places will cut back on your solar window. Protective berms, natural slopes, and thick tree cover to the north side block cold winter winds and help create a warmer microclimate around your house. See the Energy Outlet handout on landscaping and house siting.<br>
<strong><br>
Let The House Face The Sun</strong><br>
It is very important to orient the long axis of the house east-west, so that as much wall and roof length faces directly south as possible. The most livable homes group the kitchen and dining room to the east, for morning light. Clerestory windows and dormers can bring winter light into otherwise dark areas of the house (minimize skylight use). Use a solar path chart to design a building so that low winter sun shines in and high summer sun is blocked by effective use of windows, overhangs and shade.<br>
<strong><br>
South-Facing, High Quality Windows</strong><br>
Passive solar houses have large window areas on the south side where the sun comes from, and minimal windows on the north side. Some sites will suggest minimal west-facing windows (SHGC&lt;.40) as well. Window specifications should be tuned for the window location; use softcoat LowE (lower SHGC) on north, west, and possibly east-facing glazing, and hardcoat LowE, or maybe uncoated windows (.55 or higher SHGC) on south-facing glazing. You should be able to get windows with U-values below 0.32 without much difficulty by using warm-edge glazing spacers, LowE coatings, and inert gas fills.<br>
<strong><br>
Superinsulate, Build Tight, Ventilate Right</strong><br>
High R values and minimal air leakage are the most important factors in building any low-energy house. The Oregon Energy Code is a minimum, not a maximum. There is no such thing as too much insulation, only practical difficulties in implementation! Blower door test to verify house tightness. Invest in a high performance ventilation system; an air to air heat exchanger recovers the heat in exhausted ventilation air.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>This however can lead you into exotic discussions of equipment and materials which cause people to go to sleep. As the forward on one passive building book put it, &#8220;If you have never read about superinsulation before this could be a tough read&#8221;. These discussions do not include rammed earth homes:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rammedearthhomes.com/">http://www.rammedearthhomes.com/</a></p>
<p>or houses made of bales of hay or straw,</p>
<p>which would baffle most people. Bottom line is that if you can get R value 60 in your unused attic or a radiant barrier and R 30 if it is being used for storage. You will save BUNCHES of money quickly. I would add the small point that adequate ventilation of the attic space during the summer is important too. Also if you stuff R 15 in your walls anyway you can you will exceed probably 50% of the housing stock in the USA.<br>

<p>June 23, 2008, Taipei) Six years ago saw the introduction of the Graduation Pledge of Social &amp; Environmental Responsibility to Asia, at the Singapore campus of INSEAD business school.  Now, with pledges offered at five universities in Taiwan and two colleges in India, the graduation pledge programs are not only spreading through the region but are also growing in sophistication and impact.</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Students taking the voluntary oath promise to explore the social and environmental consequences of jobs they consider, and to try and improve the social-environmental performance of organizations for which they work.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">According to Matt Nicodemus, executive director of the Graduation Pledge Alliance-Asia Regional Center (GPA-Asia) in Taipei, 2008 marks several firsts for the Pledge in Taiwan.  At Soochow University (SCU), where the career center has taken over coordination of the school&#8217;s pledge program, students recently participated in more than a week of activities designed to increase awareness of ethics and responsibility in <span style="border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1212570039_3" class="yshortcuts">career choices</span> and on-the-job decisions.  The GPA chapter at Chinese Culture University (CCU) last month joined the school&#8217;s administration to co-sponsor the first-ever Earth Week on campus.  At National Taiwan University (NTU), the Student Graduation Association is creating new forms of pledge-taking ritual, and getting faculty involved.  And at National Taipei University of Education (NTUE), future teachers are being encouraged to spend the week before commencement reflecting on how they could educate their own students to help make the world better.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Taking the Pledge is so much more than just signing a piece of paper,&#8221; said Nicodemus, who helped start the first pledge program 21 years ago at Humboldt State University in Northern California, &#8220;and organizing a pledge program is so much more than just offering pledges to graduating students.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Nicodemus noted that the most effective pledge efforts have three components: 1) educating the campus community about the Pledge and social-environmental responsibility issues that students will face in their work lives; 2) making the pledge available for graduates to take; and 3) following up with pledge-signers to provide the information and support they need to live out their pledge commitments.  &#8220;Now, more and more, we&#8217;re seeing these different components in the pledge programs here in Asia.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Charged by Soochow University&#8217;s office of student affairs with responsibility for managing the school&#8217;s pledge program, Career Center director Beauty Yu and her staff have put together a multi-faceted, highly engaging and informative series of activities to introduce students to the Pledge and issues of ethics and responsibility in employment-related choices.  Beginning in mid-May, &#8220;Ethics at Work: Responsibility for your Work, Satisfying Cooperation with Colleagues, and New on the Job&#8221; ran for more than a week and included lectures, workshops, and trainings.  &#8220;We hope students will be responsible to themselves and find the proper job which fits with their own values, then try their best to make the society better,&#8221; said Yu</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">While the Pledge has been available to Soochow grads since 2005, this year&#8217;s distribution will reach a far greater number of students, and offer them much more than a single pledge card.  A pre-commencement public education program is being carried out on both the main Shihlin and downtown Taipei campuses, featuring beautifully designed informative banners, posters, and wall displays.  At graduation ceremonies on June 7th, students will receive special decorative bags containing pledge cards, special &#8220;ribbon stickers&#8221; that can be worn on their gowns to show commitment to the Pledge, and information to help pledge-takers successfully live out their commitments to social-environmental responsibility.  Faculty members and university administrators attending the events will also be able to wear ribbon stickers, to demonstrate their support for students considering and making the pledge promise.         </font></font><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">Angel Hsu, an instructor in the English department who coordinated Soochow&#8217;s pledge program last year, has brought the Pledge into her classrooms, having students write essays about how they could be socially and environmentally responsible in their jobs.  &#8220;For me,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;it was one of the most meaningful assignments I&#8217;ve given, especially because I wrote an essay myself to show the students that all of us have to consider these important questions.&#8221;   </font></font><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">Business management senior Gina Chou volunteered for &#8220;Ethics at Work&#8221; and plans to sign the pledge at Soochow&#8217;s June 7th graduation.  She emphasized, &#8220;For me, the Pledge is not only a promise to myself but to the whole world,&#8221; and noted that by signing and following through on the Pledge, she might be able to positively affect many people around her.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">Ilan County high school English teacher Huei-Wen Tsai, a graduate of CCU who signed the Pledge when it was first offered in 2004, admitted she didn&#8217;t really understand the commitment until she started to teach English in an Ilan high school.  &#8220;I think it has been very lucky for me to be a public school teacher,&#8221; said Tsai, &#8220;because the call of a teacher, in essence, corresponds very well to the cause of GPA.&#8221;  She fulfills her promise by often incorporating themes of environmental and social issues into her regular classroom instruction.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">The Graduation Pledge is spreading steadily in Taiwan, gaining new schools each year, and has also taken root in India, where several educational institutions have either begun offering the Pledge to their graduates or are considering doing so.  Frequently, the programs of the pledge schools have been started by a single faculty member who decided to offer pledges to their own students.  Success of the Pledge in their classroom then led to bigger and better things.  At Fujen University (FJU) in Taipei, Father Daniel Bauer, a longtime instructor and regular newspaper columnist, has taught about the Pledge and distributed it to students in his ethics courses since 2006.  Recently, he wrote that he&#8217;s &#8220;lending a hand in back of the scenes&#8221; with the goal of FJU beginning to include the Pledge in its official commencement ceremony.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">Meanwhile, GPA-Asia is working hard to compile and create practical resources that pledge-signers can use in making important choices of jobs and on-the-job choices, and also developing materials and processes for training students, teachers, and career counselors.  Group leaders are also meeting with a variety of governmental agencies and private organizations with which it shares goals, seeking support and cooperation.  &#8220;We&#8217;re quite excited about the interest that&#8217;s been shown in the Pledge and our work for social-environmental responsibility,&#8221; commented Matt Nicodemus, adding that contacts with Taiwan&#8217;s ministries of education and foreign affairs have been particularly promising.</font></font><font color="#000000"><font color="#007f40">          </font>     </font></p>

<h1>More Efficient, Lower</h1>
<h1>Impact Solar Panels Developed</h1>
<h2>Evergreen Solar Announces</h2>
<h2>Improved Solar Technology</h2>
<p>Massachusetts-based <a target="_new" href="http://www.evergreensolar.com/" rel="noopener">Evergreen Solar</a> has announced a new line of high efficiency solar panels this month.</p>
<p>Called the ES-A Series, the 200, 205 and 210 W solar panels are made with Evergreen&#8217;s proprietary &#8220;String Ribbon&#8221; technology. Inside the company&#8217;s custom furnaces, a set of special parallel strings are pulled through a molten pool of silicon. A thin &#8220;ribbon&#8221; forms between strings as the silicon cools. The ribbon is then cut into wafers, which are fashioned into solar cells.</p>
<p>According to Evergreen, the carbon footprint of these new panels is up to 50% smaller than those of competitors, and they have a quicker energy payback &#8212; reportedly as fast as 12 months for installed panels. This last point is particularly exciting, since the amount of energy required to make solar panels has long been a <a target="_new" href="http://www.csudh.edu/oliver/smt310-handouts/solarpan/pvpayback.htm" rel="noopener">bone of contention</a> among critics of the technology.</p>
<p>Back in the late 90s, energy paybacks for solar panels were as high as seven years. Today, they are often <a target="_new" href="http://www.jeffvail.net/2006/11/energy-payback-from-photovoltaics.html" rel="noopener">reported</a> as &#8220;1-5 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evergreen says it will begin production of its new panels by July. They will be built in its new manufacturing plant in Devens, Massachusetts, where the workforce has <a target="_new" href="http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/green/articles/2008/04/07/evergreen_solar_to_double_plants_size_add_350_jobs/" rel="noopener">reportedly swelled</a> from 300 to 1,000.</p>
<p>The company says its final products will include longer cables for easier installation, new clickable connectors and a new low voltage configuration for greater flexibility.</p>

<p x7ggi="0" cuf0q="0">&#8220;Engineers solve problems, make things happen and enhance the quality of life on this planet. This has always been a constant; however what has changed over time has been the needs of society and how engineers have responded to those needs,&#8221; according to Diran Apelian, Ph.D., Director of the Metal Processing Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, and chair of the Materials and Society program.</p>
<p x7ggi="0" cuf0q="0">&#8220;With 20 percent of the world population living in absolute poverty; 18 percent of the population lacking access to safe drinking water; 40 percent having no access to sanitation; energy consumption increasing at a higher rate than population growth; and healthcare needs and expectations increasing out of sync with the cost of health care delivery; there is no doubt that the engineer for the 21st century has to be a social scientist.&#8221;</p>
<p x7ggi="0" cuf0q="0">One such challenge is finding clean, alternative sources to produce energy at economically, competitive rates given the world&#8217;s demand for energy, and <a target="_top" href="http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Energy_Housing_and_Recycling_Advances_To_Be_Unveiled_At_TMS_2008_Annual_Meeting_999.html#" onmouseout="adlinkMouseOut(event,this,1);" onclick="adlinkMouseClick(event,this,1);" style="position: static; text-decoration: underline! important" onmouseover="adlinkMouseOver(event,this,1);" id="KonaLink1" oncontextmenu="return false;" class="kLink" rel="noopener"><font color="#0000ff" style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt; color: blue! important; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; position: static"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt; color: blue! important; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; position: static" class="kLink">global </span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt; color: blue! important; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; position: static" class="kLink">warming</span></font></a>.

<p x7ggi="0" cuf0q="0">&#8220;Meeting the growth in energy demand while mitigating climate change will demand new energy sources beyond fossil fuels, such as solar, nuclear and, ultimately, fusion.&#8221; Dr. Diaz says these new materials must be highly efficient, safe and reliable in extreme environments.</p>
<p x7ggi="0" cuf0q="0">Energy efficiency is also one of the problems with today&#8217;s housing. Stephen Lee, professor in the School of Agriculture at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, says American methods of homebuilding are not responding to global and regional changes.</p>
<p x7ggi="0" cuf0q="0">&#8220;Our houses of today are not meeting the needs of the users, nor are they performing as good global citizens.&#8221; Professor Lee believes applying industrial engineering principles to the housing delivery process could solve these problems. In his presentation, &#8220;Housing for the 21st Century &#8211; Design, Technology and Construction,&#8221; he will use the 2007 Carnegie Mellon Solar Decathlon house as a case study to illustrate process solutions.</p>

<p>But &#8220;resizing&#8221; is an inadequate definition for reengineering. <strong>Classic reengineering is re-deciding the way we do business based on the best options available to us at that time.</strong> It is not driven fundamentally by people, but by changes in technology that occur over time.</p>
<p>Take the example of our CEO&#8217;s house. Sixty years ago a young accountant told his fiancee, &#8220;I&#8217;ll build us the best home money can buy.&#8221; Then he worked with an architect to design the house. Some of the decisions he made were about which plumbing and lighting options to install. He and his architect looked at all the options available in the 1930&#8217;s and chose the best ones. So they &#8220;engineered&#8221; the house. Sixty years later, Dutch (Holland) and his wife, Jan, sat down with an architect to consider some changes. Once again they had to make decisions about plumbing and lighting. This time they had an entirely different set of options to look at. Based on these new options, they &#8220;reengineered&#8221; the house and put in plumbing and lighting systems not available to the original builder. We would expect that someone purchasing the house in 2020 will probably make different choices &#8230; ones that Dutch and Jan don&#8217;t &#8212; can&#8217;t &#8212; know about.</p>

			<p>Wow!  The Australians rally kicked the energy ball forward. I suppose this would be called the ultimate hot rocks project. Drill to the uranium and get the heat. An electricity generator that could last for 25,000 years and be totally clean. Where are the investment bankers when you need them?</p>

<h1 class="story">Tapping Into Australia&#8217;s Unique</h1>
<h1 class="story"></h1>
<h1 class="story">Hot Energy Resources</h1>
<p id="first"><span class="date">ScienceDaily (May 12, 2008)</span> — Australia is uniquely endowed with heat-producing elements under its surface that could provide potentially unlimited amounts of geothermal power for this country, says geoscientist Dr Sandra McLaren.</p>
<hr>
<p>Dr McLaren will speak about her research into Australia&#8217;s heat-producing elements, and their potential for future energy production, at the Academy of Science&#8217;s peak annual event Science at the Shine Dome May 7.She says that west of the line between Cairns and the mouth of the Murray River lies a belt of rocks containing the enriched elements uranium, thorium, and potassium that are around 1.5 billion years old. These enriched elements are essentially a heat source located in the upper part of our continental crust.&#8217;Our status as one of the most prospective countries in the world for geothermal power generation is due to this extraordinary enrichment in uranium. That&#8217;s because when we bury these enriched rocks, even beneath only about two or three kilometres of sediment, they&#8217;re capable of generating extremely high temperatures which we can use to generate geothermal power.&#8217;</p>
<p>She says that nuclear power and geothermal power use the same source of fuel – enriched uranium.</p>
<p>&#8216;The fundamental difference between the two energy options is the degree to which the uranium is enriched in a particular spot, and the way in which we choose to use it. So, although as geoscientists we are aware of this resource, there is still a lot of work we can do in assessing and documenting it and developing new exploration strategies and, further down the track, new technology to exploit this.</p>
<p>&#8216;Its an extraordinary resource that we have. Its had profound impact on our geological past, and we&#8217;re at the point in time, in terms of society, of making a choice of what to do with that resource into the future.</p>
<p>&#8216;We have on average 2-3 times the normal concentration of uranium, thorium and potassium in the crust, so we&#8217;re in a better position than probably any other country in the world to generate this type of geothermal energy.&#8217;</p>
<p>In terms of the future of geothermal power in Australia she says: &#8216;Its potentially unlimited in terms of the actual resource. I think the thing that&#8217;s going to constrain how and when we can use this resource for generating power is more on the engineering side, more understanding how to exploit it once we&#8217;ve identified how much is there.</p>
<p>&#8216;The exploration companies in Australia are used to exploring for base metals and gold and metallic resources. Exploring for geothermal energy is a different ask all together and we really need to develop a framework to get better data sets for us to assess different resources and better ways of looking fo</p>

<p>Wind farms, like these ones in California, are becoming more common in rural areas of the U<a href="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/mill3.jpg" title="mill3.jpg"></a>.S.   An industry association says last year, alone, wind power capacity in America grew by 45 percent.  Mostly wind power is generated by large propellers that can only be placed in the countryside.</p>
<p>But now, a U.S. company is offering a propeller-free personal windmill that can be set up in city or suburb.  The president of <strong><a href="http://www.mariahpower.com/">Mariah Power</a></strong>, Mike Hess, demonstrates what he calls the &#8220;Windspire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This one generates 25 to 30 percent of the power in your house, but if we are building a three kilowatts version, which is only twice the width, same height, then it generates 100 percent of your power requirements,&#8221; Hess said.</p>

<p>This new system was part of an environmentally friendly exhibit at the U.S. Botanical Garden in Washington.   The design was inspired by a 3,000 year-old windmill the Egyptians used to grind wheat. </p>
<p>The company had the modern version independently tested, here in Utah, to prove it can be competitive with large propellers of traditional windmills. </p>
<p>The large blades have been known to kill birds and bats.  And because they move much faster than wind speeds, they can be noisy.</p>
<p>But Hess says the Windspire&#8217;s verticle-axis wind turbine is not only very quiet, but also bird-friendly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bird friendly yes, because they only spin at two and a half times the speed of wind, so they can see it.&#8221; He explained.</p>

<p>Duval’s hotel won’t have conventional wind turbine &#8211; instead, he’s looking at a German-designed vertical axle turbine, thought to be was safer than having a high-speed rotating propeller that could cause serious damage if it became dislodged. The building internal environment also is a factor in the choice, he says. “We are on top of a building. We can not have anything that vibrates or emits sound. It’s got to be very smooth.”</p>
<p>Duval also plans to install a pyramid of solar panels on the roof.</p>
<p>Vertical axis wind turbines are a growing segment of the wind turbine industry. Mercedes Benz recently <a href="http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/news/2205051/mercedes-benz-pioneers-vertical"><font color="#00588c">installed one</font></a> at one of its facilities in Great Britain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a rel="lightbox" href="http://ecotality.com/life/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/vertical_wind.jpg"><img decoding="async" border="0" align="right" width="250" src="http://ecotality.com/life/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/vertical_wind.jpg" hspace="3"></a>The company said that the 20m-high turbine, developed by wind energy company <a href="http://www.quietrevolution.co.uk/"><font color="#00588c">Quiet Revolution</font></a>, was one of only six in operation in the UK and had been designed to work quietly and efficiently in urban environments where the wind direction changes frequently.</p>
<p>Mercedes-Benz plans to use the energy generated to power electric cars and has installed three charging points next to the turbine. It estimated that the installation will generate enough power for 30,000 miles of driving a year using its electric Smart fortwo cars, equivalent to the electricity needed to power two average homes. Wilfried Steffen, president and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz in the UK, said that the installation was part of a project to ultimately generate 10 per cent of the company’s energy onsite through a combination of wind energy, ground-source heat pumps and solar water heating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From London to New Zealand, vertical axis wind turbines appear to be gaining popularity as a way for just about any business to get in on the generation of power from the wind</p>

<h2>Bluenergy Solar-Wind-Turbine</h2>
<p class="illustration_right"><em>BSWT</em> is a vertical wind turbine based on sailing engineering. The wind rotor is rotated by two spiral-formed vanes. For best performance, these vanes are covered in solar cells, so that sun and wind produce electricity as one element. The BSWT installation costs relatively little, produces no noise or significant shadowing, can be easily maintained from ground level, and is an attractive addition to any home.</p>

<p>“<span nd="3" name="intelliTxt" id="intelliTXT">[The Turbine] can produce 10 kw at around 28 mph and has a cut-in wind speed of 6 mph. These turbines don’t need a braking mechanism and can self-start at very low wind speeds—something similar designs in the past could never do. </span><span nd="3" name="intelliTxt" id="intelliTXT">They take up very little space, they’re virtually silent, and multiple units can be placed within feet of one another. Delta II units can also be stacked vertically up to 50 kW.”</span></p>
<p>Vertical wind turbines are a sort of “Holy Grail” for wind energy because they tend to alleviate some of the environmental concerns associated with large scale blade turbines. While Jay’s turbine is still considered small, the design is holding promise for commercial farms. The 500-watt unit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pacwind.net/" rel="noopener"><font color="#675437">Pacwind</font></a> dropped by his garage with costs just under $3K. For his <span nd="3" name="intelliTxt" id="intelliTXT">17,000-sq-ft. garage, however, a more powerful 10kw version called the Delta II will most likely do the job. This unit comes in at $20K — but with the proper rebates will most likely fall closer to $12K. Granted, Jay’s probably not too concerned with counting pennies.Â </span></p>

			<p>In a post in-or-around May 28th I said that the Airforce was preparing to switch to a synthetic fuel made from coal. I said if done properly that it might not be a bad thing environmentally premised on the fact that the Death Comes From Above crowd was going to fly and going to kill no matter what. I mean it&#8217;s hard enough to sell a noncarbon economy without trying to argue for peace and harmony. I am for all of the above, but the Corporate Capitalists are never going to buy peace and harmony &#8211; it&#8217;s just not their thing. There is nothing good about flying from a global warming point of view. But that is for another post.</p>
<p><a href="http://gasification-igcc.blogspot.com/">http://gasification-igcc.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>Anyway in that post I repeatedly and obnoxiously referred to the process as gasification and it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s an entirely different process process using entirely different reagents and at entirely different temperatures. The proper term for that is Coal To Liquids Process(ing)(es) and Harry pointed it out to me. I am soooooo sorry. It has been corrected. I shall never do it again.</p>

<p class="blogbody"><span class="title"><strong>First US Coal To Liquid Plant Coming</strong></span>The <em>New York Times</em> reports on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/05/business/05coalfuel.html?th&amp;emc=th"><strong><span style="color: #0000aa;">plans by Rentech to build a plant to convert coal to liquid fuel burnable in diesel engines.</span></strong></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here in East Dubuque, <a href="http://www.rentechinc.com/"><strong><span style="color: #0000aa;">Rentech Inc.</span></strong></a>, a research-and-development company based in Denver, recently bought a plant that has been turning natural gas into fertilizer for forty years. Rentech sees a clear opportunity to do something different because natural gas prices have risen so high. In an important test case for those in the industry, it will take a plunge and revive a technology that exploits America&#8217;s cheap, abundant coal and converts it to expensive truck fuel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Otherwise, I don&#8217;t see us having a future,&#8221; John H. Diesch, the manager of the plant, said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a large scaling up of coal-to-liquid (CTL) production takes place then an increase in pollution seems likely. Though perhaps advances in conversion technologies and tougher regulations could prevent this. The use of coal to make liquid fuels will increase CO2 emissions since the conversion plants will emit CO2 and of course the liquid fuel will emit CO2 just as conventional diesel fuel does. Those who view rising CO2 emissions with alarm therefore see a shift to CTL as a harmful trend.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And, uniquely in this country, the plant will take coal and produce diesel fuel, which sells for more than $100 a barrel.</p>
<p>The cost to convert the coal is $25 a barrel, the company says, a price that oil seems unlikely to fall to in the near future. So Rentech is discussing a second plant in Natchez, Miss., and participating in a third proposed project in Carbon County in Wyoming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds very profitable. The longer the price of oil stays high the likelier that capitalists will decide it is worth the risk to build CTL plants. Many are holding back worried that oil prices could tank again as happened in the early 1980s. That price decline drove the <a href="http://www.futurepundit.com/mt/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=3199"><strong><span style="color: #0000aa;">Beulah North Dakota Great Plains Synfuels Plant</span></strong></a> into bankruptcy. Though it was restarted and now produces natural gas from coal profitably. Though the bankruptcy cut the capital cost of operating that plant and so is not a perfect measure of the profitability of processes to convert coal to gas or liquid.<br>

			<p>The application on CD arrive several months ago but the ACTUAL Paper application arrive today at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission simultaneously. The application filled a semitrailer truck for each agency and took a chain of workers to unload the boxes. This is not getting off to an environmentally start is it? I wonder how many trees they killed to make the application.</p>
<p>So I thought we would take this day before Weird Bird Friday to catch up with the old &#8220;hole in the ground&#8221; in the Nevada Desert.</p>
<p>Here is what the what the current female Editor of the Magazine RadWaste puts it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ans.org/pubs/magazines/rs/docs/2008-3-4-2.pdf">http://www.ans.org/pubs/magazines/rs/docs/2008-3-4-2.pdf</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t ironic?  While the nuclear reactor sector is beginning to boom&#8230;.In the area of high-level waste, the proposed Yucca Mountain/spent fuel repository project is expected to submit its license application to the NRC this year. But Congress, thanks to efforts of Yacca Mountain opponent Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev), the Senate majority leader, cut more than 100 million $$$ from the fiscal 2008 appropriation for the project, putting the the license application at risk and ensuring that continuing research&#8230;.</p>
<p>     The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry&#8217;s trade group, is so excited about the nuclear renaissance that it&#8217;s willing to put waste issues aside for now.&#8221;</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t sound good.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.republican-eagle.com/articles/index.cfm?id=50783&amp;section=News">http://www.republican-eagle.com/articles/index.cfm?id=50783§ion=News</a></p>
<p>Others seem more hopeful &#8211; the Natives re restless:</p>

<p> A major step toward building a national nuclear waste repository has been met with support from Red Wing leaders.</p>
<p>The Department of Energy on Wednesday submitted its license application to build a facility at Yucca Mountain, Nev., where proponents hope to store spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste.</p>
<p>If accepted, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will undertake what officials estimate will be a three-year licensing process.<script type="text/javascript">function photoFull (URL) {  day = new Date();  id = day.getTime();  eval("page" + id + " = window.open(URL, \\\\\'" + id + "\\\\\', \\\\\'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=510,height=510,left = 137,top = 84\\\\\');");  }</script></p>
<p id="related_content">Local tribal and city leaders lauded the action.</p>
<p>Prairie Island Indian Community Tribal Council President Ron Johnson called the application submittal “a giant step.”</p>
<p>“I hope it goes further than that,” he said.</p>
<p>The tribe has long been a supporter of the project, which proposes to store 77,000 metric tons of nuclear waste inside the remote, tunneled-out mountain.</p>
<p>Both the tribe and the city of Red Wing are members of the Nuclear Waste Strategy Coalition.</p>
<p>City officials have also backed Yucca Mountain in hopes of moving the waste out of the Red Wing area.</p>
<p>“As neighbors to a nuclear power plant, it is vital to the community to move Yucca Mountain forward and create a permanent repository for this waste,” Red Wing City Council President Carol Duff said in a statement.</p>
<p>“It cannot continue to be stored in the backyards of communities like Red Wing, creating a risk of exposure.”</p>
<p> :}</p>
<p>In fact it&#8217;s all tied up in the new Carbon Capping Bill though the good thing is that the Global Warming as a hoax arguement disappeared from the debate:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0605/p02s05-uspo.html">http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0605/p02s05-uspo.html</a></p>
<p> On Tuesday, the Department of Energy (DOE) submitted a long-awaited license application to build a nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain in Nevada – a move that supporters say is essential to revive the nuclear-power industry.</p>
<p>Nuclear-power advocates hope to use the global-warming bill as a vehicle for reviving the industry. They make the case that without a significant increase in nuclear power, it will be impossible to lower carbon emissions without a blow to US living standards.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time we begin the nuclear renaissance in America and Yucca Mountain is a vital step,&#8221; said Sen. Jim DeMint (R) of South Carolina, in a statement after the announcement. &#8220;If Congress is serious about reducing carbon emission, nonemitting nuclear energy must play an even larger role than it does today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many Democrats are wary of risking the support of some environmental groups over nuclear power. Majority leader Reid, a longtime opponent of a nuclear-waste dump in his state, charged that DOE filed the application with only about 35 percent of the work done to justify it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yucca Mountain is as close to being dead as any piece of legislation could be,&#8221; he said on Tuesday. Republicans say they are holding out for a wide-ranging debate over the global-warming bill, including many amendments. Democratic leaders worry that some amendments, including those over nuclear power, could undermine support for the bill.</p>
<p>Commenting on the diverse coalition of lawmakers now supporting the bill, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D) of California said: &#8220;They need a certain amount to stay on it. I need a certain amount not to get off it. We&#8217;re looking for that sweet spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Energy officially submitted the license application to build a nuclear waste facility at Yucca Mountain in Nevada earlier this week. A strong supporter of the Lieberman-Warner carbon-capping bill, Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was incredulous, <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0605/p02s05-uspo.htm"><font color="#000000" style="background-color: #d0d0d0">telling</font></a> reporters: “Yucca Mountain is as close to being dead as any piece of legislation could be.” However, Sens. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) and John Warner (R-Va.) both <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24955579/page/2/"><font color="#000000" style="background-color: #d0d0d0">recognize that their bill will not pass without more nuclear power</font></a>.</p>
<p>Far to Warner and Lieberman’s left though, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0605/p02s05-uspo.htm"><font color="#000000" style="background-color: #d0d0d0">thinks</font></a> their bill does not need to reform the nuclear industry: “Already in the bill there’s a whole funding stream for these low-carbon, noncarbon energy sources and that’s sufficient. I don’t think you need more.” It is nice that Boxer believes this–but the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) sure don’t.</p>
<p>Throughout the debate on Lieberman-Warner, activists such as the Environmental Defense Fund have quoted selectively from EPA and EIA studies to minimize the ruinous effects the bill would have on the U.S. economy. For example, <a href="http://www.edf.org/pressrelease.cfm?contentID=7738"><font color="#000000" style="background-color: #d0d0d0">this press release</font></a> celebrates the fact that under Lieberman-Warner the economy will grow by 80 percent by 2030.</p>
<p>What the EDF doesn’t tell you is that the<a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/downloads/s2191_EPA_Analysis.pdf"><font color="#000000" style="background-color: #d0d0d0"> same report</font></a> says Lieberman-Warner would raise energy prices by 44 percent in the same time frame. But the real kicker comes when you look at the assumptions the EPA made to come to its conclusions. Despite the fact that <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7921287/"><font color="#000000" style="background-color: #d0d0d0">the U.S. has not built a new nuclear reactor in two decades</font></a>, the EPA <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/EnergyandEnvironment/wm1944.cfm"><font color="#000000" style="background-color: #d0d0d0">assumes that the U.S. will build 50 new reactors in the next 25 years</font></a>.</p>
<p>Without these new power plants, which the Environmental Defense Fund no doubt will oppose, the U.S. economy will be 650 gigawatts of electric power short of its needs. That will send the price of energy through the roof — and kill many more jobs than the EPA currently estimates.</p>

			<p>People have been brainwashed to believe that our world will come to a crashing end without oil. The Peak Oil people in particular have a saying &#8220;back to the olduvai valley&#8221; because they believe that our civilization will crumble like the Egyptions, Greeks and other GREAT civilizations. Olduvai was the valley where they found the homonid Lucy&#8217;s bones.</p>
<p>Admittedly some of those societal &#8220;downs&#8221; caused famine and pestilence, but in others it merely led to lots of people going back to farming. As silly as it may sound, you can generate electricity with a bicycle and charge a battery to run a computer. Us modern humans have run on excess energy  for so long it might not hurt us or the planet to take a break and set some priorities.</p>
<p>So anyway from where I live in Riverton IL in the USA, I would just go back to farming and let a few yard birds run. Others are not so lucky. I have said with no malice or cruelty that a lot of people are going to die. But I think we will do what humanity has done for 1000&#8217;s of years&#8230;we hang together.</p>

<h2 id="article-header-h2">Farming without fossils</h2>
<p>In a world on the cusp of fuel shortages, one enterprising collection of British farmers have come up with a solution they claim is practical, profitable – and close to home. They’re growing their own. <strong>Trevor Lawson</strong> reports</p>
<p>Barton reckons that the Goodwood estate’s tenant farmers could produce enough biofuel to supply the estate and themselves, and still have a surplus for sale. The key, he argues, is keep it local. “There’s no point in producing seed here, sending it miles for processing and then bringing the fuel all the way back. It’s too inefficient.” So Barton is looking at a combined rape press and refinery system that will produce 2,000 litres of fuel an hour, round the clock, for as long as there is rape seed to supply it. He’s also got plans for the pressed ‘cake’ that’s left over. “You can make it into dense briquettes for a superb solid fuel, burning more slowly than wood but at a higher temperature. So it can be used to feed boilers to generate heat and electricity.” Barton’s logic seems inescapable, and it’s finding allies in Whitehall, too. Nick Cooper manages the Farming Without Fossil Fuels project at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>

<p><strong>Peak Oil: the threat to our food security<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Peak oil refers to the point when the maximum amount of oil that can be extracted globally is reached. Thereafter, production will tail off as remaining reserves become more difficult and more expensive to harvest. Many of the services that we currently take for granted &#8211; cheap flights, cheap imports and global distribution of food &#8211; will be radically curtailed.<br>
 One of the greatest impacts will be on how and where our food is produced. The dominant models of intensive agriculture and the global food trade depend on vast inputs of oil. In a post peak oil world, the combination of higher transport costs, climate change and increased conflict will necessitate us all relying far more on re-localised food supplies. Even though it requires far lower amounts of oil, organic farming is not exempt from the need to adapt.</p>
<p>You can find out more in our information sheets on <a href="http://www.peakoil.com/">peak oil</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_and_agriculture">climate change and agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>Over the last 20 years, the Soil Association has established organic farming as the most sustainable method of production and helped grow a burgeoning market for organic food. Now we must refine our focus if we are to adapt to the changing external circumstances which will touch all our lives very soon. The phrase that comes to mind is that we are &#8216;building the ark of sustainable agriculture&#8217; for the new era ahead.</p>
<p>The challenge is immediate, but fear should not be the driver. The Soil Association is optimistic that we have the vision and means to create a new, localised food culture that will deliver long-term quality of life in place of the old dynamic of unrestrained globalisation and short-termist exploitation.</p>

<h3>Applying Energy Descent Plans to Food and Farming &#8211; an article in Living Earth magazine.</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.soilassociation.org/web/sa/saweb.nsf/home/index.html" title="SA"><font color="#b5b380">The Soil Association</font></a> is the UK’s organic certification body, and they are making peak oil and the relocalisation of food the focal point of their 60th Anniversary conference in Cardiff in February. I am editing a report that will accompany the conference, which explores this deeper, and to introduce this, I recently wrote an article that appears in <a href="http://www.soilassociation.org/web/sa/saweb.nsf/Living/le_extra.html" title="LE"><font color="#b5b380">Living Earth Magazine</font></a>, the organisation’s publication. It suggests that the concept of Energy Descent Plans could be applied to food and farming in the UK, an idea that will be explored in more depth in the report. Here is the article followed by some additions from within the Soil Association.<span id="more-564"></span></p>
<p><strong>Energy scarcity is an opportunity for a better world, says Rob Hopkins</strong></p>
<p>I used to think that one day the world would literally run out of oil. A driver in Leicestershire would use the last drop and that would be that, similar to the felling of the last Truffula Tree in Dr Seuss’s The Lorax. It turns out that scarcity kicks in earlier than that. It’s not the last drop that is the problem but the mid-point of production, when all the oil that is easy and cheap to extract has been used up. It looks as if we are reaching that point soon.</p>

For those that do not&#8230; well that is something we all should be planning for now. There are probably 2 billion people in harms way. What about the economy? Well what about it?

			<p>Let&#8217;s look at the food and energy issue another way. I spend most of my time talking to people about how to use less energy in their homes. But, according to Dale Allen Phieffer I can save much more on food than in my house or my car.</p>

<blockquote><p>The secret of great wealth with no obvious source is some forgotten crime, forgotten because it was done neatly.—Balzac</p></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The journalist&#8217;s rule says: follow the money. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This rule, however, is not really axiomatic but derivative, in that money, as even our vice president will tell you, is really a way of tracking energy. We&#8217;ll follow the energy.</font><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We learn as children that there is no free lunch, that you don&#8217;t get something from nothing, that what goes up must come down, and so on. The scientific version of these verities is only slightly more complex. As James Prescott Joule discovered in the nineteenth century, there is only so much energy. You can change it from motion to heat, from heat to light, but there will never be more of it and there will never be less of it. The conservation of energy is not an option, it is a fact. This is the first law of thermodynamics.</font><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Special as we humans are, we get no exemptions from the rules. All animals eat plants or eat animals that eat plants. This is the food chain, and pulling it is the unique ability of plants to turn sunlight into stored energy in the form of carbohydrates, the basic fuel of all animals. Solar-powered photosynthesis is the only way to make this fuel. There is no alternative to plant energy, just as there is no alternative to oxygen. The results of taking away our plant energy may not be as sudden as cutting off oxygen, but they are as sure.</font><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scientists have a name for the total amount of plant mass created by Earth in a given year, the total budget for life. They call it the planet&#8217;s &#8220;primary productivity.&#8221; There have been two efforts to figure out how that productivity is spent, one by a group at Stanford University, the other an independent accounting by the biologist Stuart Pimm. Both conclude that we humans, a single species among millions, consume about 40 percent of Earth&#8217;s primary productivity, 40 percent of all there is. This simple number may explain why the current extinction rate is 1,000 times that which existed before human domination of the planet. We 6 billion have simply stolen the food, the rich among us a lot more than others.</font><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Energy cannot be created or canceled, but it can be concentrated. This is the larger and profoundly explanatory context of a national-security memo George Kennan wrote in 1948 as the head of a State Department planning committee, ostensibly about Asian policy but really about how the United States was to deal with its newfound role as the dominant force on Earth. &#8220;We have about 50 percent of the world&#8217;s wealth but only 6.3 percent of its population,&#8221; Kennan wrote. &#8220;In this situation, we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment. Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity without positive detriment to our national security. To do so, we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day-dreaming; and our attention will have to be concentrated everywhere on our immediate national objectives. We need not deceive ourselves that we can afford today the luxury of altruism and world-benefaction.&#8221;</font><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;The day is not far off,&#8221; Kennan concluded, &#8220;when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts.&#8221;</font></p>
<p>If you follow the energy, eventually you will end up in a field somewhere. Humans engage in a dizzying array of artifice and industry. Nonetheless, more than two thirds of humanity&#8217;s cut of primary productivity results from agriculture, two thirds of which in turn consists of three plants: rice, wheat, and corn. In the 10,000 years since humans domesticated these rains, their status has remained undiminished, most likely because they are able to store solar energy in uniquely dense, transportable bundles of carbohydrates. They are to the plant world what a barrel of refined oil is to the hydrocarbon world. Indeed, aside from hydrocarbons they are the most concentrated form of true wealth&#8211;sun energy&#8211;to be found on the planet.</p>
<p>As Kennan recognized, however, the maintenance of such a concentration of wealth often requires violent action. Agriculture is a recent human experiment. For most of human history, we lived by gathering or killing a broad variety of nature&#8217;s offerings. Why humans might have traded this approach for the complexities of agriculture is an interesting and long-debated question, especially because the skeletal evidence clearly indicates that early farmers were more poorly nourished, more disease-ridden and deformed, than their hunter-gatherer contemporaries. Farming did not improve most lives. The evidence that best points to the answer, I think, lies in the difference between early agricultural villages and their pre-agricultural counterparts&#8211;the presence not just of grain but of granaries and, more tellingly, of just a few houses significantly larger and more ornate than all the others attached to those granaries. Agriculture was not so much about food as it was about the accumulation of wealth. It benefited some humans, and those people have been in charge ever since.</p>
<p>Domestication was also a radical change in the distribution of wealth within the plant world. Plants can spend their solar income in several ways. The dominant and prudent strategy is to allocate most of it to building roots, stem, bark&#8211;a conservative portfolio of investments that allows the plant to better gather energy and survive the downturn years. Further, by living in diverse stands (a given chunk of native prairie contains maybe 200 species of plants), these perennials provide services for one another, such as retaining water, protecting one another from wind, and fixing free nitrogen from the air to use as fertilizer. Diversity allows a system to &#8220;sponsor its own fertility,&#8221; to use visionary agronomist Wes Jackson&#8217;s phrase. This is the plant world&#8217;s norm.</p>
<p>There is a very narrow group of annuals, however, that grow in patches of a single species and store almost all of their income as seed, a tight bundle of carbohydrates easily exploited by seed eaters such as ourselves. Under normal circumstances, this eggs-in-one-basket strategy is a dumb idea for a plant. But not during catastrophes such as floods, fires, and volcanic eruptions. Such catastrophes strip established plant communities and create opportunities for wind-scattered entrepreneurial seed bearers. It is no accident that no matter where agriculture sprouted on the globe, it always happened near rivers. You might assume, as many have, that this is because the plants needed the water or nutrients. Mostly this is not true. They needed the power of flooding, which scoured landscapes and stripped out competitors. Nor is it an accident, I think, that agriculture arose independently and simultaneously around the globe just as the last ice age ended, a time of enormous upheaval when glacial melt let loose sea-size lakes to create tidal waves of erosion. It was a time of catastrophe.</p>
<p>Corn, rice, and wheat are especially adapted to catastrophe. It is their niche. In the natural scheme of things, a catastrophe would create a blank slate, bare soil, that was good for them. Then, under normal circumstances, succession would quickly close that niche. The annuals would colonize. Their roots would stabilize the soil, accumulate organic matter, provide cover. Eventually the catastrophic niche would close. Farming is the process of ripping that niche open again and again. It is an annual artificial catastrophe, and it requires the equivalent of three or four tons of TNT per acre for a modern American farm. Iowa&#8217;s fields require the energy of 4,000 Nagasaki bombs every year.</p>
<p>Iowa is almost all fields now. Little prairie remains, and if you can find what Iowans call a &#8220;postage stamp&#8221; remnant of some, it most likely will abut a cornfield. This allows an observation. Walk from the prairie to the field, and you probably will step down about six feet, as if the land had been stolen from beneath you. Settlers&#8217; accounts of the prairie conquest mention a sound, a series of pops, like pistol shots, the sound of stout grass roots breaking before a moldboard plow. A robbery was in progress.</p>
<p>When we say the soil is rich, it is not a metaphor. It is as rich in energy as an oil well. A prairie converts that energy to flowers and roots and stems, which in turn pass back into the ground as dead organic matter. The layers of topsoil build up into a rich repository of energy, a bank. A farm field appropriates that energy, puts it into seeds we can eat. Much of the energy moves from the earth to the rings of fat around our necks and waists. And much of the energy is simply wasted, a trail of dollars billowing from the burglar&#8217;s satchel.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already mentioned that we humans take 40 percent of the globe&#8217;s primary productivity every year. You might have assumed we and our livestock eat our way through that volume, but this is not the case. Part of that total&#8211;almost a third of it&#8211;is the potential plant mass lost when forests are cleared for farming or when tropical rain forests are cut for grazing or when plows destroy the deep mat of prairie roots that held the whole business together, triggering erosion. The Dust Bowl was no accident of nature. A functioning grassland prairie produces more biomass each year than does even the most technologically advanced wheat field. The problem is, it&#8217;s mostly a form of grass and grass roots that humans can&#8217;t eat. So we replace the prairie with our own preferred grass, wheat. Never mind that we feed most of our grain to livestock, and that livestock is perfectly content to eat native grass. And never mind that there likely were more bison produced naturally on the Great Plains before farming than all of beef farming raises in the same area today. Our ancestors found it preferable to pluck the energy from the ground and when it ran out move on.</p>
<p>Today we do the same, only now when the vault is empty we fill it again with new energy in the form of oil-rich fertilizers. Oil is annual primary productivity stored as hydrocarbons, a trust fund of sorts, built up over many thousands of years. On average, it takes 5.5 gallons of fossil energy to restore a year&#8217;s worth of lost fertility to an acre of eroded land&#8211;in 1997 we burned through more than 400 years&#8217; worth of ancient fossilized productivity, most of it from someplace else. Even as the earth beneath Iowa shrinks, it is being globalized.</p>
<p>Six thousand years before sodbusters broke up Iowa, their Caucasian blood ancestors broke up the Hungarian plain, an area just northwest of the Caucasus Mountains. Archaeologists call this tribe the LBK, short for linearbandkeramik, the German word that describes the distinctive pottery remnants that mark their occupation of Europe. Anthropologists call them the wheat-beef people, a name that better connects those ancients along the Danube to my fellow Montanans on the Upper Missouri River. These proto-Europeans had a full set of domesticated plants and animals, but wheat and beef dominated. All the domesticates came from an area along what is now the Iraq-Syria-Turkey border at the edges of the Zagros Mountains. This is the center of domestication for the Western world&#8217;s main crops and live stock, ground zero of catastrophic agriculture.</p>
<p>Two other types of catastrophic agriculture evolved at roughly the same time, one centered on rice in what is now China and India and one centered on corn and potatoes in Central and South America. Rice, though, is tropical and its expansion depends on water, so it developed only in floodplains, estuaries, and swamps. Corn agriculture was every bit as voracious as wheat; the Aztecs could be as brutal and imperialistic as Romans or Brits, but the corn cultures collapsed with the onslaught of Spanish conquest. Corn itself simply joined the wheat-beef people&#8217;s coalition. Wheat was the empire builder; its bare botanical facts dictated the motion and violence that we know as imperialism.</p>
<p>The wheat-beef people swept across the western European plains in less than 300 years, a conquest some archaeologists refer to as a &#8220;blitzkrieg.&#8221; A different race of humans, the Cro-Magnons&#8211;hunter-gatherers, not farmers&#8211;lived on those plains at the time. Their cave art at places such as Lascaux testifies to their sophistication and profound connection to wildlife. They probably did most of their hunting and gathering in uplandsand river bottoms, places the wheat farmers didn&#8217;t need, suggesting the possibility of coexistence. That&#8217;s not what happened, however. Both genetic and linguistic evidence say that the farmers killed the hunters. The Basque people are probably the lone remnant descendants of Cro-Magnons, the only trace.</p>
<p>Hunter-gatherer archaeological sites of the period contain spear points that originally belonged to the farmers, and we can guess they weren&#8217;t trade goods. One group of anthropologists concludes, &#8220;The evidence from the western extension of the LBK leaves little room for any other conclusion but that LBK-Mesolithic interactions were at best chilly and at worst hostile.&#8221; The world&#8217;s surviving Blackfeet, Assiniboine Sioux, Inca, and Maori probably have the best idea of the nature of these interactions.</p>
<p>Wheat is temperate and prefers plowed-up grasslands. The globe has a limited stock of temperate grasslands, just as it has a limited stock of all other biomes. On average, about 10 percent of all other biomes remain in something like their native state today. Only 1 percent of temperate grasslands remains undestroyed. Wheat takes what it needs.</p>
<p>The supply of temperate grasslands lies in what are today the United States, Canada, the South American pampas, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Europe, and the Asiatic extension of the European plain into the sub-Siberian steppes. This area largely describes the First World, the developed world. Temperate grasslands make up not only the habitat of wheat and beef but also the globe&#8217;s islands of Caucasians, of European surnames and languages. In 2000 the countries of the temperate grasslands, the neo-Europes, accounted for about 80 percent of all wheat exports in the world, and about 86 percent of all com. That is to say, the neo-Europes drive the world&#8217;s agriculture. The dominance does not stop with grain. These countries, plus the mothership&#8211;Europe accounted for three fourths of all agricultural exports of all crops in the world in 1999.</p>
<p>Plato wrote of his country&#8217;s farmlands:</p>
<p>What now remains of the formerly rich land is like the skeleton of a sick man. &#8230;Formerly, many of the mountains were arable, The plains that were full of rich soil are now marshes. Hills that were once covered with forests and produced abundant pasture now produce only food for bees. Once the land was enriched by yearly rains, which were not lost, as they are now, by flowing from the bare land into the sea. The soil was deep, it absorbed and kept the water in loamy soil, and the water that soaked into the hills fed springs and running streams everywhere. Now the abandoned shrines at spots where formerly there were springs attest that our description of the land is true.</p>
<p>Plato&#8217;s lament is rooted in wheat agriculture, which depleted his country&#8217;s soil and subsequently caused the series of declines that pushed centers of civilization to Rome, Turkey, and western Europe. By the fifth century, though, wheat&#8217;s strategy of depleting and moving on ran up against the Atlantic Ocean. Fenced-in wheat agriculture is like rice agriculture. It balances its equations with famine. In the millennium between 500 and 1500, Britain suffered a major &#8220;corrective&#8221; famine about every ten years; there were seventy-five in France during the same period. The incidence, however, dropped sharply when colonization brought an influx of new food to Europe.</p>
<p>The new lands had an even greater effect on the colonists themselves. Thomas Jefferson, after enduring a lecture on the rustic nature by his hosts at a dinner party in Paris, pointed out that all of the Americans present were a good head taller than all of the French. Indeed, colonists in all of the neo-Europes enjoyed greater stature and longevity, as well as a lower infant-mortality rate&#8211;all indicators of the better nutrition afforded by the onetime spend down of the accumulated capital of virgin soil.</p>
<p>The precolonial famines of Europe raised the question: What would happen when the planet&#8217;s supply of arable land ran out? We have a clear answer. In about 1960 expansion hit its limits and the supply of unfarmed, arable lands came to an end. There was nothing left to plow. What happened was grain yields tripled.</p>
<p>The accepted term for this strange turn of events is the green revolution, though it would be more properly labeled the amber revolution, because it applied exclusively to grain&#8211;wheat, rice, and corn. Plant breeders tinkered with the architecture of these three grains so that they could be hypercharged with irrigation water and chemical fertilizers, especially nitrogen. This innovation meshed nicely with the increased &#8220;efficiency&#8221; of the industrialized factory-farm system. With the possible exception of the domestication of wheat, the green revolution is the worst thing that has ever happened to the planet.</p>
<p>For openers, it disrupted long-standing patterns of rural life worldwide, moving a lot of no-longer-needed people off the land and into the world&#8217;s most severe poverty. The experience in population control in the developing world is by now clear: It is not that people make more people so much as it is that they make more poor people. In the forty-year period beginning about 1960, the world&#8217;s population doubled, adding virtually the entire increase of 3 billion to the world&#8217;s poorest classes, the most fecund classes. The way in which the green revolution raised that grain contributed hugely to the population boom, and it is the weight of the population that leaves humanity in its present untenable position.</p>
<p>Discussion of these, the most poor, however, is largely irrelevant to the American situation. We say we have poor people here, but almost no one in this country lives on less than one dollar a day, the global benchmark for poverty. It marks off a class of about 1.3 billion people, the hard core of the larger group of 2 billion chronically malnourished people&#8211;that is, one third of humanity. We may forget about them, as most Americans do.</p>
<p>More relevant here are the methods of the green revolution, which added orders of magnitude to the devastation. By mining the iron for tractors, drilling the new oil to fuel them and to make nitrogen fertilizers, and by taking the water that rain and rivers had meant for other lands, farming had extended its boundaries, its dominion, to lands that were not farmable. At the same time, it extended its boundaries across time, tapping fossil energy, stripping past assets.</p>
<p>The common assumption these days is that we muster our weapons to secure oil, not food. There&#8217;s a little joke in this. Ever since we ran out of arable land, food is oil. Every single calorie we eat is backed by at least a calorie of oil, more like ten. In 1940 the average farm in the United States produced 2.3 calories of food energy for every calorie of fossil energy it used. By 1974 (the last year in which anyone looked closely at this issue), that ratio was 1:1. And this understates the problem, because at the same time that there is more oil in our food there is less oil in our oil. A couple of generations ago we spent a lot less energy drilling, pumping, and distributing than we do now. In the 1940s we got about 100 barrels of oil back for every barrel of oil we spent getting it. Today each barrel invested in the process returns only ten, a calculation that no doubt fails to include the fuel burned by the Hummers and Blackhawks we use to maintain access to the oil in Iraq.</p>
<p>David Pimentel, an expert on food and energy at Cornell University, has estimated that if all of the world ate the way the United States eats, humanity would exhaust all known global fossil-fuel reserves in just over seven years. Pimentel has his detractors. Some have accused him of being off on other calculations by as much as 30 percent. Fine. Make it ten years.</p>
<p>Fertilizer makes a pretty fine bomb right off the shelf, a chemistry lesson Timothy McVeigh taught at Oklahoma City&#8217;s Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in 1995&#8211;not a small matter, in that the green revolution has made nitrogen fertilizers ubiquitous in some of the more violent and desperate corners of the world. Still, there is more to contemplate in nitrogen&#8217;s less sensational chemistry.</p>
<p>The chemophobia of modem times excludes fear of the simple elements of chemistry&#8217;s periodic table. We circulate petitions, hold hearings, launch websites, and buy and sell legislators in regard to polysyllabic organic compounds&#8211;polychlorinated biphenyls, polyvinyls, DDT, 2-4d, that sort of thing&#8211;not simple carbon or nitrogen. Not that agriculture&#8217;s use of the more ornate chemistry is benign&#8211;an infant born in a rural, wheat-producing county in the United States has about twice the chance of suffering birth defects as one born in a rural place that doesn&#8217;t produce wheat, an effect researchers blame on chlorophenoxy herbicides. Focusing on pesticide pollution, though, misses the worst of the pollutants. Forget the polysyllabic organics. It is nitrogen-the wellspring of fertility relied upon by every Eden-obsessed backyard gardener and suburban groundskeeper&#8211;that we should fear most.</p>
<p>Those who model our planet as an organism do so on the basis that the earth appears to breathe&#8211;it thrives by converting a short list of basic elements from one compound into the next, just as our own bodies cycle oxygen into carbon dioxide and plants cycle carbon dioxide into oxygen. In fact, two of the planet&#8217;s most fundamental humors are oxygen and carbon dioxide. Another is nitrogen.</p>
<p>Nitrogen can be released from its &#8220;fixed&#8221; state as a solid in the soil by natural processes that allow it to circulate freely in the atmosphere. This also can be done artificially. Indeed, humans now contribute more nitrogen to the nitrogen cycle than the planet itself does. That is, humans have doubled the amount of nitrogen in play.</p>
<p>This has led to an imbalance. It is easier to create nitrogen fertilizer than it is to apply it evenly to fields. When farmers dump nitrogen on a crop, much is wasted. It runs into the water and soil, where it either reacts chemically with its surroundings to form new compounds or flows off to fertilize something else, somewhere else.</p>
<p>That chemical reaction, called acidification, is noxious and contributes significantly to acid rain. One of the compounds produced by acidification is nitrous oxide, which aggravates the greenhouse effect. Green growing things normally offset global warming by sucking up carbon dioxide, but nitrogen on farm fields plus methane from decomposing vegetation make every farmed acre, like every acre of Los Angeles freeway, a net contributor to global warming. Fertilization is equally worrisome. Rainfall and irrigation water inevitably washes the nitrogen from fields to creeks and streams, which flows into rivers, which floods into the ocean. This explains why the Mississippi River, which drains the nation&#8217;s Corn Belt, is an environmental catastrophe. The nitrogen fertilizes artificially large blooms of algae that in growing suck all the oxygen from the water, a condition biologists call anoxia, which means &#8220;oxygen-depleted.&#8221; Here there&#8217;s no need to calculate long-term effects, because life in such places has no long term: everything dies immediately. The Mississippi River&#8217;s heavily fertilized effluvia has created a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico the size of New Jersey.</p>
<p>America&#8217;s biggest crop, grain corn, is completely unpalatable. It is raw material for an industry that manufactures food substitutes. Likewise, you can&#8217;t eat unprocessed wheat. You certainly can&#8217;t eat hay. You can eat unprocessed soybeans, but mostly we don&#8217;t. These four crops cover 82 percent of American cropland. Agriculture in this country is not about food; it&#8217;s about commodities that require the outlay of still more energy to become food.</p>
<p>About two thirds of U.S. grain corn is labeled &#8220;processed,&#8221; meaning it is milled and otherwise refined for food or industrial uses. More than 45 percent of that becomes sugar, especially high-fructose corn sweeteners, the keystone ingredient in three quarters of all processed foods, especially soft drinks, the food of America&#8217;s poor and working classes. It is not a coincidence that the American pandemic of obesity tracks rather nicely with the fivefold increase in corn-syrup production since Archer Daniels Midland developed a high-fructose version of the stuff in the early seventies. Nor is it a coincidence that the plague selects the poor, who eat the most processed food.</p>
<p>It began with the industrialization of Victorian England. The empire was then flush with sugar from plantations in the colonies. Meantime the cities were flush with factory workers. There was no good way to feed them. And thus was born the afternoon tea break, the tea consisting primarily of warm water and sugar. If the workers were well off, they could also afford bread with heavily sugared jam&#8211;sugar-powered industrialization. There was a 500 percent increase in per capita sugar consumption in Britain between 1860 and 1890, around the time when the life expectancy of a male factory worker was seventeen years. By the end of the century the average Brit was getting about one sixth of his total nutrition from sugar, exactly the same percentage Americans get today&#8211;double what nutritionists recommend.</p>
<p>There is another energy matter to consider here, though. The grinding, milling, wetting, drying, and baking of a breakfast cereal requires about four calories of energy for every calorie of food energy it produces. A two-pound bag of breakfast cereal burns the energy of a half-gallon of gasoline in its making. All together the food-processing industry in the United States uses about ten calories of fossil-fuel energy for every calorie of food energy it produces.</p>
<p>That number does not include the fuel used in transporting the food from the factory to a store near you, or the fuel used by millions of people driving to thousands of super discount stores on the edge of town, where the land is cheap. It appears, however, that the corn cycle is about to come full circle. If a bipartisan coalition of farm-state lawmakers has their way&#8211;and it appears they will&#8211;we will soon buy gasoline containing twice as much fuel alcohol as it does now. Fuel alcohol already ranks second as a use for processed corn in the United States, just behind corn sweeteners. According to one set of calculations, we spend more calories of fossil-fuel energy making ethanol than we gain from it. The Department of Agriculture says the ratio is closer to a gallon and a quart of ethanol for every gallon of fossil fuel we invest. The USDA calls this a bargain, because gasohol is a &#8220;clean fuel.&#8221; This claim to cleanness is in dispute at the tailpipe level, and it certainly ignores the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, pesticide pollution, and the haze of global gases gathering over every farm field. Nor does this claim cover clean conscience; some still might be unsettled knowing that our SUVs&#8217; demands for fuel compete with the poor&#8217;s demand for grain.</p>
<p>Green eaters, especially vegetarians, advocate eating low on the food chain, a simple matter of energy flow. Eating a carrot gives the diner all that carrot&#8217;s energy, but feeding carrots to a chicken, then eating the chicken, reduces the energy by a factor of ten. The chicken wastes some energy, stores some as feathers, bones, and other inedibles, and uses most of it just to live long enough to be eaten. As a rough rule of thumb, that factor of ten applies to each level up the food chain, which is why some fish, such as tuna, can be a horror in all of this. Tuna is a secondary predator, meaning it not only doesn&#8217;t eat plants but eats other fish that themselves eat other fish, adding a zero to the multiplier each notch up, easily a hundred times, more like a thousand times less efficient than eating a plant.</p>
<p>This is fine as far as it goes, but the vegetarian&#8217;s case can break down on some details. On the moral issues, vegetarians claim their habits are kinder to animals, though it is difficult to see how wiping out 99 percent of wildlife&#8217;s habitat, as farming has done in Iowa, is a kindness. In rural Michigan, for example, the potato farmers have a peculiar tactic for dealing with the predations of whitetail deer. They gut-shoot them with small-bore rifles, in hopes the deer will limp off to the woods and die where they won&#8217;t stink up the potato fields.</p>
<p>Animal rights aside, vegetarians can lose the edge in the energy argument by eating processed food, with its ten calories of fossil energy for every calorie of food energy produced. The question, then, is: Does eating processed food such as soy burger or soy milk cancel the energy benefits of vegetarianism, which is to say, can I eat my lamb chops in peace? Maybe. If I&#8217;ve done my due diligence, I will have found out that the particular lamb I am eating was both local and grass-fed, two factors that of course greatly reduce the embedded energy in a meal. I know of ranches here in Montana, for instance, where sheep eat native grass under closely controlled circumstances&#8211;no farming, no plows, no corn, no nitrogen. Assets have not been stripped. I can&#8217;t eat the grass directly. This can go on. There are little niches like this in the system. Each person&#8217;s individual charge is to find such niches.</p>
<p>Chances are, though, any meat eater will come out on the short end of this argument, especially in the United States. Take the case of beef. Cattle are grazers, so in theory could live like the grass-fed lamb. Some cattle cultures&#8211;those of South America and Mexico, for example&#8211;have perfected wonderful cuisines based on grass-fed beef. This is not our habit in the United States, and it is simply a matter of habit. Eighty percent of the grain the United States produces goes to livestock. Seventy-eight percent of all of our beef comes from feed lots, where the cattle eat grain, mostly corn and wheat. So do most of our hogs and chickens. The cattle spend their adult lives packed shoulder to shoulder in a space not much bigger than their bodies, up to their knees in shit, being stuffed with grain and a constant stream of antibiotics to prevent the disease this sort of confinement invariably engenders. The manure is rich in nitrogen and once provided a farm&#8217;s fertilizer. The feedlots, however, are now far removed from farm fields, so it is simply not &#8220;efficient&#8221; to haul it to cornfields. It is waste. It exhales methane, a global-warming gas. It pollutes streams. It takes thirty-five calories of fossil fuel to make a calorie of beef this way; sixty-eight to make one calorie of pork.</p>
<p>Still, these livestock do something we can&#8217;t. They convert grain&#8217;s carbohydrates to high-quality protein. All well and good, except that per capita protein production in the United States is about double what an average adult needs per day. Excess cannot be stored as protein in the human body but is simply converted to fat. This is the end result of a factory-farm system that appears as a living, continental-scale monument to Rube Goldberg, a black-mass remake of the loaves-and-fishes miracle. Prairie&#8217;s productivity is lost for grain, grain&#8217;s productivity is lost in livestock, livestock&#8217;s protein is lost to human fat&#8211;all federally subsidized for about $15 billion a year, two thirds of which goes directly to only two crops, corn and wheat.</p>
<p>This explains why the energy expert David Pimentel is so worried that the rest of the world will adopt America&#8217;s methods. He should be, because the rest of the world is. Mexico now feeds 45 percent of its grain to livestock, up from 5 percent in 1960. Egypt went from 3 percent to 31 percent in the same period, and China, with a sixth of the world&#8217;s population, has gone from 8 percent to 26 percent. All of these places have poor people who could use the grain, but they can&#8217;t afford it.</p>
<p>I live among elk and have learned to respect them. One moonlit night during the dead of last winter, I looked out my bedroom window to see about twenty of them grazing a plot of grass the size of a living room. Just that small patch among acres of other species of native prairie grass. Why that species and only that species of grass that night in the worst of winter when the threat to their survival was the greatest? What magic nutrient did this species alone contain? What does a wild animal know that we don&#8217;t? I think we need this knowledge.</p>
<p>Food is politics. That being the case, I voted twice in 2002. The day after Election Day, in a truly dismal mood, I climbed the mountain behind my house and found a small herd of elk grazing native grasses in the morning sunlight. My respect for these creatures over the years has become great enough that on that morning I did not hesitate but went straight to my job, which was to rack a shell and drop one cow elk, my household&#8217;s annual protein supply. I voted with my weapon of choice&#8211;an act not all that uncommon in this world, largely, I think, as a result of the way we grow food. I can see why it is catching on. Such a vote has a certain satisfying heft and finality about it. My particular bit of violence, though, is more satisfying, I think, than the rest of the globe&#8217;s ordinary political mayhem. I used a rifle to opt out of an insane system. I killed, but then so did you when you bought that package of burger, even when you bought that package of tofu burger. I killed, then the rest of those elk went on, as did the grasses, the birds, the trees, the coyotes, mountain lions, and bugs, the fundamental productivity of an intact natural system, all of it went on.</p>
