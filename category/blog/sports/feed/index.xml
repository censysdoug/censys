										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK I know that since I scrapped Weird Bird Friday I have only posted about Energy and Environmental Issues&#8230;BUT I spent the whole day tearing out nasty 50 year old insulation. There were thousands of mud hornets nests and wasp nests, along with some real live wasps. This was because there was an unsealed vent behind this 1950 paneling and very nasty filthy insulation full of dust. So the problem is fixed after 10 hours work and I am whipped. Energy Tough Love is sometimes a very tough dirty work. So&#8230;.</p>
<p>My favorite sports writer and number 2 funny man Mike Nadel got terminated by the pukes at GateHouse News. Please go here to protest that:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gatehousemedia.com/">http://www.gatehousemedia.com/</a></p>
<p>Tell the jerk faces they made a mistake.</p>
<p>But you can also help Mike. He started a website or Blog and he needs our help and support SOOOO if you would go there and show your support that would be great. It&#8217;s:</p>
<p><a href="http://thebaldesttruth.blogspot.com/"> http://thebaldesttruth.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>Here is a sample that I think shows his wit and charm. Please football players stay out of ocean going fishing boats. NOTHING ever good comes from it:</p>
<p>:}</p>
<h3 class="post-title entry-title"> <a href="http://thebaldesttruth.blogspot.com/2009/03/whats-up-chicago.html">What&#8217;s up, Chicago?</a></h3>
<p class="post-body entry-content"> ^Since, first and foremost, I&#8217;m still a Chicago sports hack, it&#8217;s time to return to my roots with an update on what&#8217;s going on around town &#8230;</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic">NORTH SIDERS</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold"><br />
</span></p>
<p>Bloody-sock boy <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold">Curt Schilling</span> is telling people he wants to pitch for The Team That Championships Forgot, prompting the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic">Sun-Times</span> to ask readers: &#8220;What would Schilling look like in a Cubs uniform?&#8221;</p>
<p>The obvious answer: He&#8217;d look like an old, broken-down Cub.</p>
<p>There would be a sentimental reason to get him, I suppose. After all, it would be nice to have a current player who was an active big-leaguer when the Cubs won the &#8217;45 pennant.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic">SOUTH SIDERS</span></span></p>
<p>People are doubting and dissing the White Sox again, which means they&#8217;re a pretty solid bet. Seems whenever they are supposed to be bad they end up being good (and vice versa).</p>
<p>Still, Sox fans can&#8217;t feel too good about their heroes&#8217; chances if they have to rely on a pitcher &#8211; <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold">Jose Contreras </span>&#8211;<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold"> </span>who is old enough to be Schilling&#8217;s dad.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">BEARS</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold">Jerry Angelo</span> has a funny way of backing up his declaration that he needs to &#8220;fix&#8221; the QB situation.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold">Matt Cassel</span> could have been had for a first-round draft pick. And several other quarterbacks, including <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold">Kurt Warner</span>, could be had for nothing more than a pile of McCaskey moolah.</p>
<p>But no!</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold">Kyle Orton,</span> the QB Angelo says isn&#8217;t good enough, remains a shoo-in to return under center.</p>
<p>Though Orton isn&#8217;t an All-Pro, maybe Angelo finally has realized that the Bears&#8217; receivers rank just a tad behind those Cassel worked with in New England and Warner threw to in Arizona.</p>
<p>Not that Angelo plans to actually bring in guys who can get open and catch the ball.</p>
<p>Good news, though, Bear Country &#8230; the GM is making progress in talks aimed at bringing back <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold">John St. Clair</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic">Super Bears, Super Bowl!</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic">BULLS</span></span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold"><br />
</span></p>
<p>One need not read between the lines to recognize that <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold">John Paxson</span> is getting tired of <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold">Vinny Del Excuse</span>. All one has to do is read the lines.</p>
<p>After Del Excuse told a large media contingent that the new players Paxson acquired would need time and practice to fit in, the GM told the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic">Tribune</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that as a big issue. It would be great to have some practice time &#8230; but that&#8217;s not the reason we didn&#8217;t play well in New Jersey and Washington. We didn&#8217;t come out ready to play.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paxson didn&#8217;t need to say whose job it is to get the team ready to play.</p>
<p>In their most recent game, the Bulls made an amazing fourth-quarter comeback to beat the Rockets. The most amazing thing: Del Excuse actually let his best player off the bench during crunch time, and <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold">Derrick Rose</span> responded by leading the rally.</p>
<p>Interesting how that works.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic">BLACKHAWKS</span></span></p>
<p>Young. Exciting. Fun. Successful.</p>
<p>Oh, and on TV, too.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;da thunk it?</p>
