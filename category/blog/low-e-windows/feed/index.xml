										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I agreed to publish this here because it is such a different perspective then the one I have or CES has. We tend to blame builders for not just serving up top notch energy efficient residences. Then there is the issue of retrofitting. As always this is no endorsement of Ryan or his Real Estate firm. Believe me I have no intention of buying a home in Alaska.</p>

More buyers see the value of it, and more builders and sellers are starting to make changes in that direction. There is still a long way to go before energy efficiency and reducing waste becomes the standard for new homes and improved existing homes, but a larger pool of buyers demanding these features can help move the needle bit by bit.</div>

<h1 class="title">Do Europeans Make Better Windows Than We Do?</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">Differences in testing protocols yield different U-factors, but do European manufacturers have a ‘secret sauce’?</h3>
<div class="post_data">Posted on Oct 15 2012 by <a title="View team page." href="http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/users/scottg">Scott Gibson</a></div>
<div>It should come as no surprise that Europe, home of the Passivhaus standard, produces some outstanding windows. Some builders of high-efficiency houses in North America turn to European window manufacturers for their <span class="hovertip_target">glazing</span>, even though some U.S. and Canadian producers also offer high-performance products of their own.Is there a way to compare the performance data on windows from these two sources? That’s what Steve Young, now planning a <span class="hovertip_target">Passive House</span> in Climate Zone 5, would like to know.</p>
<p>“I have read many blogs and Q&amp;A pages from this web site and I am still somewhat confused about European windows,” Young writes in <a href="http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/community/forum/energy-efficiency-and-durability/25365/european-windows-vs-north-american-windows">Q&amp;A post at GreenBuildingAdvisor</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am really shocked by this article. The idea that residential energy consumption could change so dramatically  in only 16 years is so amazing. Its like when we shifted to coal or later when we shifted to natural gas and then electricity. Only nobody is really talking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=10271">http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=10271</a></p>
<p><span class="date">March 7, 2013</span></p>
<h1><a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=10271#">Heating and cooling no longer majority of U.S. home energy use</a></h1>
<p>For decades, space heating and cooling (space conditioning) accounted for more than half of all residential energy consumption. Estimates from the most recent <a href="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2009/index.cfm?view=consumption">Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS)</a>, collected in 2010 and 2011 and released in 2011 and 2012, show that 48% of energy consumption in U.S. homes in 2009 was for heating and cooling, down from 58% in 1993. Factors underpinning this trend are increased adoption of more efficient equipment, better insulation, more efficient windows, and population shifts to warmer climates. The shift in how energy is consumed in homes has occurred even as per-household energy consumption has <a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=6570">steadily declined</a>.</p>
<p>While energy used for space conditioning has declined, energy consumption for appliances and electronics continues to rise. Although some appliances that are subject to federal efficiency standards, such as refrigerators and clothes washers, have become more efficient, the increased number of devices that consume energy in homes has offset these efficiency gains. Non-weather related energy use for appliances, electronics, water heating, and lighting now accounts for 52% of total consumption, up from 42% in 1993. The majority of devices in the fastest growing category of residential end-uses are powered by electricity, <a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=10251">increasing the total amount of primary energy needed to meet residential electricity demand</a>. As described in yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=10251">Today in Energy</a>, increased electricity use has a disproportionate effect on the amount of total primary energy required to support site-level energy use.</p>
<p>Other notable trends in household energy consumption include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average U.S. household consumed 11,320 kilowatthours (kWh) of electricity in 2009, of which the largest portion (7,526 kWh) was for appliances, electronics, lighting, and miscellaneous uses.</li>
<li>On average, residents living in homes constructed in the 1980s consumed 77 million Btu of total energy at home. By comparison, those living in newer homes, built from 2000 to 2009, consumed 92 million Btu per household, which is 19% more.</li>
<li>Space heating accounted for 63% of natural gas consumed in U.S. homes in 2009; the remaining 37% was for water heating, cooking, and miscellaneous uses.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I mean really if they are going to drop their insistence on solar panel installations as part of a retrofit then why keep the name? Are they now a software company or are they now a software and then install whatever company? Good questions with no answers. It would be like Tide if it were to stop making soap and started making dishwashers. Would they keep the name and why?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/a-peak-at-solarcitys-new-energy-efficiency-software?">http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/a-peak-at-solarcitys-new-energy-efficiency-software?</a></p>
<h1>Has SolarCity Created the Amazon 1-Click for Energy Efficiency?</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We believe SolarCity has the best database of residential energy use of anyone in the world.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Stephen Lacey: June 28, 2013</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After SolarCity shifted its energy efficiency strategy and pulled back from doing residential retrofits in-house, the solar services behemoth is moving straight into <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/intelligent-efficiency-innovations-reshaping-the-energy-efficiency-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intelligent efficiency</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GTM&#8217;s Eric Wesoff recently reported on SolarCity&#8217;s <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/SolarCity-Shifts-Its-Home-Efficiency-Strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolving</a> business plan and the <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Can-SolarCity-Scale-Energy-Efficiency-Services-Like-Solar-Roofs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resulting changes</a> that company executives say will scale residential efficiency in the same way solar services have <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/us-residential-solar-financing-to-reach-5.7-billion-by-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scaled residential solar</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But solar is very different from efficiency. For the most part, solar is very standardized and installations are uniform from home to home. Efficiency retrofits encompass an extraordinarily broad category of activities and skills. Incentives are also quite different for efficiency, making it more complicated from a financial perspective. That&#8217;s why <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/are-solar-companies-equipped-to-get-into-energy-efficiency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only a handful</a> of U.S. solar contractors have offered efficiency as an in-house service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SolarCity decided that doing the retrofit work itself was not the best way to scale. Instead, it has turned from manpower to the power of big data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The secret sauce is a &#8220;simulation engine&#8221; that shows homeowners exactly how much they&#8217;re spending on energy everywhere in their house. The initial database was created using information from 16,000 home energy audits performed over the last five years. It relies on an algorithm developed at the Department of Energy that crunches 100 million calculations per home for each individual energy efficiency audit (which is still performed by SolarCity when installing solar).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The simulation software looks at every component in a home in relation to one another,&#8221; said SolarCity COO Peter Rive. &#8220;Every ten minutes, it thinks about what one thing is doing and about its effect on the rest of the systems within the home.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is an old piece but it is still as true today as it was then. Air conditioning and by that I mean cooling air when it is hot is very expensive both financially and with regards to energy consumption.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/buildings-without-air-conditioners-the-latest-in-energy-efficiency-5413/">http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/buildings-without-air-conditioners-the-latest-in-energy-efficiency-5413/</a></p>
<h1>Buildings Without Air Conditioners: The Latest in Energy Efficiency</h1>
<h3>Air conditioners consume an inordinate amount of power in  the U.S. and they aren&#8217;t very efficiently used. To save energy, some say  leave them out.</h3>
<h6>Michael Kanellos: December 22, 2008</h6>
<p>Sometimes the most efficient air conditioning system is not having one at all.</p>
<p>To curb energy consumption, architects with projects in  temperate cities – Seattle, Portland, San Francisco – have started to  design buildings without mechanical air conditioners. These buildings  will have heaters in all likelihood, but not air conditioning (see <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/can-greentech-make-housing-cheaper-921.html">Can Greentech Make Housing Cheaper</a> and <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/green-buildings-no-subsidies-needed--916.html">Green Buildings No Subsidies Needed</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;There are only five days a year you need cooling in  Seattle,&#8221; said Amanda Sturgeon, an architect and senior associate at the  firm <a href="http://www.perkinswill.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perkins + Will</a>, who recently designed a building without a mechanical conditioner.</p>
<p>In some cases, architects are putting in air-side  economizers, i.e., computer-controlled windows that open to let in  cooling breezes (see <a href="http://multimedia.greentechmedia.com/video/photosolar/" target="_self" rel="noopener">The Solar Window</a>).  The General Services Administration building in San Francisco uses  openable windows on 12 of its 18 floors that let in cool breezes at  night that, ideally, keep the offices cool in the daytime.  There is no  mechanical cooling in the open office areas.</p>
<p>This shift comes courtesy of two trends. One, building  developers and contractors have latched onto green buildings as an  economic opportunity. Designing a building to LEED Silver or Gold  standards – the environmental building standards promulgated by the <a href="http://www.usgbc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Green Building Council</a> –  only adds around 2 percent to the overall cost or less, according to  various contractors, architects and researchers. Designing to the LEED  Platinum standard can add only 6 percent if carefully planned. The  trick, say Sturgeon and others, is to exploit as many passive,  design-centric techniques for scoring LEED points before moving on to  the potentially more expensive, equipment-centric ones like biomass  boilers or new types of lighting systems.</p>

<p>If you live in the United States, you&#8217;ve probably heard recently  about the impending energy crunch that is facing Americans. In the next  20 years, U.S. energy consumption will increase 45 percent for  electricity, 62 percent for natural gas and 33 percent for <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/oil-refining.htm">oil</a>, according to the <a href="http://www.doe.gov/">Department of Energy</a> (DOE). The DOE also says that energy supplies will be unable to meet  demand for the next two decades. For consumers, this means paying higher  prices for electricity, natural gas and oil.</p>
<p>While much of the  country is concentrating on ways to increase its energy supply, some  researchers have been working on new low-power-consuming technologies.  Among these new technologies are <strong>smart windows</strong>, and we aren&#8217;t talking about Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/operating-system.htm">operating system</a>. This exciting, cutting-edge window technology allows consumers to block either all <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/light.htm">light</a> or just some by simply turning a knob or pressing a button. This type  of light control could potentially save billions of dollars on heating,  cooling and lighting costs (research indicates that approximately 2  percent of all the energy used in the United States is &#8220;consumed&#8221; by  residential windows).</p>
<p>In this article, you will learn how smart windows work and how they could save you money.</p>

<p>The top energy-saving home improvements<br />
By <a href="mailto:LBruce@Bankrate.com">Laura                A. Bruce</a> • Bankrate.com</p>
<p>These are the top single-family home energy-efficiency                improvements that reduce energy bills. The return on investment                (ROI) is annual, based on 7 cents per kilowatt-hour.</p>
<p>Example: A homeowner spends $500 to insulate                an attic that has no insulation, and saves $25 per month on energy                bills. $500 divided by $25 per month equals 20 months. This means                the investment paid for itself in 20 months and, for the next 30                years, gives monthly dividends of $25 per month in lower energy                bills. The $25 grows each time there is a rate increase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Look  just buy good caulk. That is it. Nothing lasts for 25 years so do not believe that. Usually caulk lasts for six or seven years. That&#8217;s it. So do not pay 6 $$$ per tube. But, if you pay 3 or 4 $$$ you are in the right range. If you can get that exact same type of caulk on sale all the better.</p>

In the winter, those gaps may make the house          drafty and chilly. All year long, a leaky house not only wastes energy,          but can lead to water damage and provide a path for insects.

<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: x-small;">In all the discussion of insulation and R-values, don&#8217;t  forget that poor weatherproofing is often a more important source of discomfort, as well as high heating and cooling bills.&nbsp;
<p></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: x-small;">Some air leakage can be prevented during  construction by using housewrap or getting a tight fit between framing  members, for example. Once the house is built, however, the remaining  gaps must be sealed. Gaps around doors and  window sashes should be weatherstripped, and gaps between permanent  building materials sealed with caulking.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://www.alsnetbiz.com/homeimprovement/htseries/5021.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="246" /><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular; font-size: xx-small;"><strong>FIG.          1</strong> &#8211; Where caulking should be applied, from the Sunset book, <em>Insulation          and Weatherstripping</em>, © Sunset Publishing Corp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://www.alsnetbiz.com/homeimprovement/htseries/step4.gif" alt="" width="93" height="68" /></span><strong>TYPES OF WEATHERSTRIPPING</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: x-small;">The greatest source of air leakage in most homes              occurs around doors, windows, and access hatches, such as the ceiling              opening from the living area into an unheated attic (Fig. 4). Weatherstripping              can be a delicate job because those openings need to be fitted loosely              enough that the door or window operates freely, yet tightly enough              that air leakage is stopped.&nbsp;
<p></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: x-small;">The type of weatherstripping you&#8217;ll use  depends on the location and the type of opening. Three types of  weatherstripping are common:&nbsp;
<p></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Compression</strong>–Compression weatherstripping              (Fig. 5) is used to seal swinging doors and window sashes. It consists              of a molded strip (it may be wood, aluminum or rigid vinyl) with a              flexible vinyl bulb along one side. As a rule, compression weatherstripping              is the most durable type available.&nbsp;
<p></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>V-Type Strips</strong>–V-shaped  weatherstripping (Figs. 6 &amp; 7) is fitted against the side of the  door or window jamb so it presses against the edge of the door or sash  and forms a seal. V-stripping may be vinyl or bronze.&nbsp;
<p></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Foam</strong>–Foam weatherstripping (Fig. 8) is              used to seal either swinging or sliding doors or windows. It comes              in various sizes with an adhesive backing on one side. It is fastened              to the edge of a door or window stop, or to the bottom of a sliding              window sash.&nbsp;
<p></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Thresholds and Door Bottoms</strong>–A  threshold fills the gap between the floor and the bottom of a door. It  may have a built-in vinyl bulb. If not, it must be used in combination  with a door bottom (Fig. 9), mounted on the lower edge of the door.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So if you want to read about all that caulk or look at the pretty pictures about how to install weather stripping. Please go to the sight and look. More tomorrow.</p>
