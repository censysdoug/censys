With just 78 planes in the air and Tanks running out of fuel the Russian attack appears uncoordinated and without passion. There are even rumors of Russian Units laying down their guns. In part here is why. Think about Brazil attacking Spain.</p>

<p>Russia&#8217;s economy is &#8220;incredibly unimportant in the global economy except for oil and gas,&#8221; Jason Furman, a Harvard economist and former advisor to President Barack Obama, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/21/business/economy/ukraine-russia-economy.html?smid=tw-share" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="3833ffc99460c6de181a669dc35eb096">The New York Times.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s basically a big gas station,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His comments come as the West prepares <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/21/statement-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-on-russian-announcement-on-eastern-ukraine/" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="7bd2d70c52d7b2017ceccb055122336e">heavy sanctions</a> on Russia if it invades Ukraine. While they have the potential to throw the Russian economy into chaos, these measures could also reverberate to further damage the US, Europe, and the rest of the world as they battle inflation and rising energy prices — a ripple effect that the West hopes to mitigate.</p>
<p>On Monday, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/map-where-are-donetsk-luhansk-ukraine-russia-2022-2" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="f1a4c149a6bb8c3977ad89ca46bfbafb">Moscow declared the independence of two breakaway regions of Ukraine and sent troops there</a> — escalating the prospect of a major war. President Joe Biden has already <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-orders-sanctions-russia-backed-eastern-ukraine-separatist-regions-2022-2" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="bf7125005aab9537167f85ca2b703e20">ordered sanctions</a> on the separatist regions — Donetsk and Luhansk — prohibiting US citizens from engaging in any exports, imports, or new investments in these areas.</p>
<p>Despite Russia&#8217;s size and wealth in raw materials, its economy is more on par with Brazil than with nations like Germany, France, and the UK, <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?most_recent_value_desc=false" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="60" data-uri="8081f643505061a94e157a69ddaf0bbb">according to the latest nominal GDP data from the World Bank.</a> According to the World Bank, Russia&#8217;s economy is smaller than Italy&#8217;s and South Korea&#8217;s, two nations with less than half of Russia&#8217;s population.</p>

<p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">One hundred years ago, Congress passed the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, setting up a system in which companies lease public lands to wrest valuable oil and gas from the ground. In the century since, the royalties and rent that those corporations pay to the American people for access have remained essentially unchanged even as the scale of development and profits has grown hugely.</p>
<p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">As senators from different parties, we have our share of policy differences. But we both believe in sticking up for the public interest and the taxpayer. In this case, we agree that oil and gas companies should pay fair market value for the public resources they extract and sell. They aren’t doing that now — not even close — and the American public is the big loser.</p>
<p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">That’s why we <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.tomudall.senate.gov/news/press-releases/udall-grassley-introduce-bill-to-ensure-taxpayers-get-fair-share-for-public-lands-leasing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced the Fair Returns for Public Lands Act</a> this year to reform the antiquated law that governs royalties and the leasing of public land.</p>
<p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The country’s economy and the oil and gas industries have changed significantly since 1920. Automobiles had just started to replace the horse and buggy, and the oil industry was a relatively new enterprise dominated by the successors of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil. Yet, since then, the federal royalty rate for oil and gas on public lands has remained steady, at a bargain-basement 12.5 percent of the value of what’s extracted.</p>

<p>Xcel Energy <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xcel-energy-end-coal-upper-154800947.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">plans to close</a> its last two coal-fired power plants in Minnesota by 2030, a decade earlier than scheduled, while keeping its nuclear power plants running through at least 2040 — the latest step in the eight-state utility’s plan to reach <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/xcel-commits-to-100-carbon-free-electricity-by-20501#gs.d6nxos">100 percent carbon-free</a> electricity by 2050.</p>
<p>The proposed early closures are part of its Upper Midwest Energy Plan, which Xcel expects to submit to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission in July. If approved, it will allow Xcel to cut its carbon emissions in the state by 80 percent compared to 2005 levels. That’s a key metric from Xcel’s <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/xcel-commits-to-100-carbon-free-electricity-by-20501#gs.d6nxos">companywide zero-carbon</a> goals announced in December, up from its previous target of 60 percent reduction from 2005 levels by 2030.</p>
<p>Monday’s announcement comes as part of a settlement agreement with environmental and labor groups, meant both to boost clean energy alternatives and help ease the job and economic losses when the Allen S. King coal power plant in Bayport, Minnesota closes by 2028 and the Sherco 3 coal-fired generator in Becker, Minnesota closes by 2030.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Xcel would proceed with plans to buy the Mankato Energy Center natural-gas plant. But its plans to build a new natural-gas power plant, as well as extend the operating license of its Monticello nuclear plant past its 2030 expiration until at least 2040, are being opposed by some environmental groups.</p>

They were only speculation before. And now that the plastic has begun to swamp the ocean and permeate our food chain. This maybe a little bit too late. Had we done this type of thing 30-40 years ago our species would not be in danger. Still it is a good step. But maybe it would be better off to just plant a trillion trees, to give us breathing space literally for this type of thing to catch up</p>

<p>This system will tie for largest lithium-ion battery in the world when it comes online in December 2020; the <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/fluence-kicks-off-with-dedicated-financing-massive-supply-contract#gs.6s8e6k">AES Alamitos plant</a> of the same size is due around the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-9 article-content">
<p>SCE wants to complement the massive battery with a portfolio of smaller units, ranging from 10 to 40 megawatts, scattered around the area. Developers of those smaller include E.ON, Able Grid, Ormat, AltaGas and Enel. Swell, which aggregates fleets of home batteries into grid assets, won a 14-megawatt contract for behind-the-meter demand response.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fossil fuels and their burning to generate energy for work, like gasoline in an internal combustion engine in your typical automobile is killing this planet. Humans have used our atmosphere as an open sewer for as long as we can with out killing our species off. Yes if we leave it in the ground it will cause radical changes in our lives and our economy. NO we will not huddle in the cold and the dark. But even if we did is it better to be dead?</p>

<p>Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-california-natgas/los-angeles-abandons-new-natural-gas-plants-in-favor-of-renewables-idUSKCN1Q12C9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently announced</a> the city is scrapping plans for a multi-billion-dollar update to three natural gas power plants, instead choosing to invest in renewable energy and storage.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">“</span>This is the beginning of the end of natural gas in Los Angeles,” said Mayor Garcetti. “The climate crisis demands that we move more quickly to end dependence on fossil fuel, and that’s what today is all about.”</p>
<p>Last year America’s carbon emissions<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/climate/greenhouse-gas-emissions-increase.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> rose over 3 percent</a>, despite coal plants closing and being replaced in part by natural gas, the much-touted “<a href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Natural-Gas/How-Natural-Gas-Is-Paving-The-Way-To-A-Cleaner-Energy-Future.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bridge fuel</a>” and “cleaner” fossil fuel alternative.</p>
<p>As a new series from the sustainability think tank the Sightline Institute points out, the idea of natural gas as a bridge fuel is “<a href="https://www.sightline.org/2019/02/12/calling-natural-gas-a-bridge-fuel-is-alarmingly-deceptive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alarmingly deceptive</a>.”</p>
<p>But signs are emerging that, despite oil and gas industry efforts to shirk blame for the climate crisis and promote gas as part of a “<a href="https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/energy-outlook/demand-by-fuel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lower-carbon fuel mix</a>,” the illusion of natural gas as a bridge fuel is starting to crumble.</p>

<p>The indications of a warming world are numerous and hard to miss. Last year was the third-warmest year on record for both the planet and the United States — exceeded only by 2015 and 2016. In June, scientists reported that Antarctica has lost 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 — yielding “enough water to cover Texas to a depth of nearly 13 feet,” <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-antarctica-global-warming-20180613-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Associated Press reported</a>.</p>
<p>The indications of inaction on the subject are also abundant and visible. Last year, <a id="PEBSL000163" title="Donald Trump" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/donald-trump-PEBSL000163-topic.html">Donald Trump</a> pulled the United States out of the Paris agreement on greenhouse gas emissions. The <a id="ORGOV000048" title="U.S. Environmental Protection Agency" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/environmental-issues/u.s.-environmental-protection-agency-ORGOV000048-topic.html">Environmental Protection Agency</a> has moved to ease regulations on power plants and motor vehicles that were integral to the Obama administration’s efforts to slow climate change.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Bipartisan action – once a normal response to environmental harms – is not on the agenda for Congress or the White House. But a growing group of farsighted pragmatists are nonetheless trying to find a middle ground between the entrenched adversaries.</p>

<p dir="ltr">There are many who want to buy an efficient and stable <a href="https://www.jenreviews.com/water-heater/">water heater</a> for their homes. But do they? Water heaters do the difficult job of heating the water supply of your home. Providing you with immediate hot water when needed through various fixtures and knobs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Like many other appliances, a water heater is more convenient than manually heating up the water whenever needed. It cuts back time and effort, for most homeowners, while making life simpler. So why do most people hurry when choosing the right water heater? Something this important needs careful consideration of features and functions.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">The best part about using the <a href="https://www.jenreviews.com/best-water-heater/">best water heater</a> is that it lasts for years. It requires minimal maintenance and even if you hire a professional to maintain one, it doesn’t cost you big bucks. That said, finding a dependable water heater isn’t easy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Because water is being constantly heated inside the tank, it needs to be energy efficient and spacious enough to accommodate the entire house. Anything that takes up more energy is a waste, costing you a hefty power bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So how do water heaters work?</p>

There is still a long way to go before energy efficiency and reducing waste becomes the standard for new homes and improved existing homes, but a larger pool of buyers demanding these features can help move the needle bit by bit.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, announced in Tennessee that the &#8220;War On Coal&#8221; was over. This during his announcement that the EPA was with drawing the Clean Power Plan proposed by the Obama Administration. What a joke this administration is. They accuse the former head of the EPA, <a id="yui_3_10_0_1_1507732472206_940" class=" td-u" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_McCarthy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gina McCarthy </a>,  of picking winners and losers. Well guess what? They have already been picked. Coal lost.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/2017/10/09/texas-monticello-power-plant-closes-signaling-undeniable-shift-natural-gas-renewable-energy">http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/2017/10/09/texas-monticello-power-plant-closes-signaling-undeniable-shift-natural-gas-renewable-energy</a></p>
<h1 id="art-title" class="art-title / p-name">Texas&#8217; Monticello power plant closes, signaling the undeniable shift to natural gas and renewable energy</h1>
<h3 id="yui_3_10_0_1_1507732472206_941" class="title">Dallas Morning News Editorial</h3>
<p>If there were any remaining doubts, the age of coal is over and the era of natural gas and renewables is officially here.</p>
<p>Luminant&#8217;s decision last week to shut its Monticello Power Plant near Mount Pleasant, one of Texas&#8217; largest and dirtiest coal-fired electricity plants, is a prime example of this shift. The plant&#8217;s pending closure in January is a win for clean air and the result of the new economics of energy that renders coal-fired power plants like the Monticello facility cost-prohibitive relics.</p>
<p>This is particularly true in Texas: Hydraulic fracturing has made natural gas production cleaner and cheaper than coal.  Each year, electricity from <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/energy/2015/05/26/on-texas-power-grid-coals-prominence-is-sliding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sun and wind contribute more megawatts</a> to the state&#8217;s power grid. The state&#8217;s deregulated electricity market increases competition, which leaves <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/energy/2017/01/19/getting-rid-coal-power-plants-led-one-stunning-statistic-eia-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">costly, emissions belching coal-fired power plants </a>like Monticello on the wrong side of a historic transformation.</p>
<h3>We&#8217;re pleased that Luminant took this step after a year-long review of its operations. A decade ago, this editorial board helped lead the charge against the former TXU Corp.&#8217;s plan to build about a dozen coal-fired power plants in the state.</h3>

<p>By Molly Taft, Laura A. Shepard and Monika Sharma</p>
<p>Alongside Highway 401 in northern North Carolina is a 21st-century twist on a classic rural scene. A few miles outside of Roxboro, sheep graze among <a href="http://www.researchtriangle.org/news-and-events/person-county-solar-park-expansion-nears-completion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5,000 panels</a> at the Person County Solar Park, keeping the grass tidy on the rural installation.</p>
<p>Fields like these aren&#8217;t just scenic settings for roadtripping tourists to snap photos. <a href="http://www.ecowatch.com/tag/solar">Solar</a> has &#8220;been some of the only economic development to happen in rural North Carolina in the last 30 years,&#8221; explained Richard Harkrader, CEO of a local solar company.</p>
<p>For companies like Harkrader&#8217;s Carolina Solar Energy, the Tar Heel State is a great place to do business. Abundant sunshine, <a href="http://www.cleanenergyconservatives.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/2017_FINAL_CCE-Poll-Press-Release_03.14.17_PDF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ample support</a> for clean energy and smart public policy have spurred the rapid growth of solar. Today, North Carolina boasts more solar capacity than <a href="http://www.seia.org/research-resources/top-10-solar-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">every state</a> except California. In the first quarter of 2017, North Carolina added more solar than any other state, and its solar industry <a href="http://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/north-carolina" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">employs</a> more people than <a href="http://about.wfu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wake Forest University</a>.</p>
