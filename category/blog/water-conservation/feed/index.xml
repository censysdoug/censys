										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First off, spell check does not like the word tankless. You would think by now that the people at WORD Press would have gotten over that spelling by now. Second off (to be consistent) this is not and article that CES can defend or debate. It is an article generated by another site so &#8220;Buyer Beware&#8221;. The articles has a lot of extraneous Ads and unnecessary clutter. Please feel free to ignore all of that. I have read the article and for the most part it is factual, and more extensive then most. So with out further ado:</p>

<h1 class="entry-title">Tankless Water Heater Cost &amp; Pros and Cons – Are They Worth It?</h1>
<div class="entry-meta"><span class="posted-on"><a title="12:26 pm" href="https://happydiyhome.com/tankless-water-heater-cost/" rel="bookmark"><time class="updated" datetime="2020-12-31T14:01:31+00:00">December 31, 2020</time><time class="entry-date published" datetime="2020-12-31T12:26:25+00:00">December 31, 2020</time></a></span> <span class="byline">by <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" title="View all posts by HappyDIYHome Staff" href="https://happydiyhome.com/author/wpx_jenrevie/" rel="author"><span class="author-name">HappyDIYHome Staff</span></a></span></span></div>

<div class="entry-content">
<p>Water heaters are extremely important to your <a href="https://happydiyhome.com/best-drain-cleaner/">plumbing system</a>, and this goes for both residential buildings and commercial spaces. Many people are turning to newer options, and this can lead you to wonder what a tankless water heater costs because this style of water heater will only heat up the water you use. Traditionally, water heaters heated and stored water on a continuous basis, and this can be expensive if you use a lot of water. As long as they get installed and connected correctly, it’s easy to control your tankless water heater cost for years at a time.</p>
<p>You get the choice of a single point unit or whole house units. A single point unit is slightly more inexpensive to buy and install because you put them right next to a water source. Whole house units cost more to install, but they are powerful enough to heat all of the water in your home at one time. The tankless water heater cost has a slightly wider price range due to a variety of the factors, and it starts at $2,000 and goes up to around $4,500 from start to finish.</p>
<p>The average cost is right around $2,800 for a whole house gas unit. The tankless water heater cost has fluctuating labor rates too. The flow rate, brand, and type will also influence your tankless water heater cost, and this is why you want to get a few estimates before you settle on one company to perform the installation. This can help ensure that you get a fair price with professional-quality results.</p>

<p>Former Vice President <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/10000451">Joe Biden</a> released a sprawling plan Tuesday to revamp American infrastructure and energy to both curb climate change and spur economic growth.</p>
<p>The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee’s proposal aims to achieve carbon-free power generation by 2035. As the coronavirus pandemic leaves the U.S. mired in an economic crisis, Biden said he will set out to create “millions” of union jobs that pay at least $15 per hour as the U.S. overhauls its roads, bridges, trains, auto industry and broadband system.</p>
<div class="BoxInline-container  ">
<div id="BoxInline-ArticleBody-6" class="BoxInline-container" data-module="mps-slot"></div>
</div>
<p>The plan, which comes days after a joint task force formed by the Biden and Sen. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/bernie-sanders/">Bernie Sanders</a> campaigns outlined a climate change agenda, sets out a more ambitious approach to developing clean energy than the Biden campaign did during the Democratic primary. It calls for $2 trillion in spending over four years, more than the $1.7 trillion the campaign previously proposed to spend over a decade.</p>
<p>“Even if we weren’t facing a pandemic and an economic crisis, we should be making these investments anyway,” Biden said of the plan during remarks in Delaware. He called the investments “critical” for the economy and public health.</p>

<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">BERLIN — Germany is shutting down one of its seven remaining nuclear power plants as part of a planned phase-out of atomic energy production by the end of 2022.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Utility company EnBW has said it will take the Philippsburg Nuclear Power Plant off the grid at 7 p.m. (1800 GMT) Tuesday. The plant&#8217;s license to operate expires at midnight.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Under Germany&#8217;s “energy transition” plan, the country aims to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources over the coming decades. The government agreed earlier this year to stop producing electricity from coal-fired plants by 2038 at the latest.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Proponents of nuclear power argue that shutting down the remaining reactors will endanger Germany&#8217;s energy security, making it more reliant on greenhouse gas-producing coal and gas and on electricity imported from neighboring countries that still have atomic plants.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2019/10/mist-showers-sustainable-decadence.html">https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2019/10/mist-showers-sustainable-decadence.html</a></p>

<h3 class="entry-header">Mist Showers: Sustainable Decadence?</h3>
<div class="entry-content">
<div class="entry-body">
<p>The daily shower would be hard to sustain in a world without fossil fuels. The mist shower, a satisfying but forgotten technology which uses very little water and energy, could be a solution. Designer Jonas Görgen developed a do-it-yourself kit to convert almost any shower into a mist shower and sent me one to try out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e888330240a4be94e0200d-700wi" alt="Mist-shower-hack-kit" /></p>

<h2><strong>The Carbon Footprint of the Daily Shower</strong></h2>
<p>The shower doesn’t get much attention in the context of climate change. However, like <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2010/09/piston-powered-aircraft-as-fuel-efficient-as-current-average-jet.html">airplanes</a>, <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2008/06/citroen-2cv.html">cars</a>, and <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/02/heating-people-not-spaces.html">heating systems</a>, it has become a very wasteful and carbon-intensive way to provide for a basic need: washing the body. Each day, many of us pour roughly 70 litres of hot water over our bodies in order to be “clean”.</p>
<p>This practice requires two scarce resources: water and energy. More attention is given to the showers&#8217; high water consumption, but energy use is just as problematic. Hot water production accounts for the second most significant use of energy in many homes (after heating), and much of it is used for showering. Water treatment and distribution also use lots of energy.</p>
<p>In contrast to the energy used for space heating, which has decreased during the last decades, the energy used for hot water in households has been steadily growing. One of the reasons is that people are showering longer and more frequently, and using increasingly powerful shower heads. For example, in the Netherlands from 1992 to 2016, shower frequency increased from 0.69 to 0.72 showers per day, shower duration increased from 8.2 to 8.9 minutes, and the average water flow increased from 7.5 to 8.6 litres per minute. [1]</p>
<blockquote><p>In many industrial societies it&#8217;s now common to shower at least once per day</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Go there and read and read and read. I may never take a shower again. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have mixed feelings about this article. On one level the Corporations and the international concerns that are most responsible for Global Warming should be MADE to pay the price. Very little should be paid by Common People. Still Common People drive cars, heat their homes and work in places that pollute so they should pay a little. It&#8217;s the willingness to pay that bothers me. We should all be pulling in this together.</p>

<div class="c-article-meta">
<p class="c-dek">More Americans than ever are worried about climate change, but they’re not willing to pay much to stop it.</p>
<address id="byline" class="c-byline"><span class="c-byline__author"><a class="c-byline__link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/robinson-meyer/">Robinson Meyer</a></span></address>

<div></div>
<div>
<p>A surging number of Americans understand that climate change is happening and believe that it could harm their family and the country, according to a new poll from Yale and George Mason University.</p>
<p>But at the same time, Americans are not any more willing to pay money to fight climate change than they were three years ago, says another new poll, conducted by the Associated Press and the University of Chicago.</p>
</div>
<p>The polls suggest that public opinion about climate change is in a state of upheaval. Even as President Donald Trump <a href="http://www.axios.com/reality-check-trump-climate-change-comments-6a07878d-2385-4f07-af5b-cbe408cd737d.html" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'0',r'None'">has cast doubt on climate change</a>, most Americans have rejected his position. Record numbers of Americans describe climate change as a real and present danger. Nearly a quarter of the country says they already see its tidings in their day-to-day life, saying “personal observations of weather” helped convince them of climate change’s reality.</p>
<p>Despite this increasing acceptance, there is no clear political path forward. Last year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2018/10/08/summary-for-policymakers-of-ipcc-special-report-on-global-warming-of-1-5c-approved-by-governments/" data-omni-click="r'article',r'',d,r'intext',r'1',r'None'">“rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes”</a> were needed to keep the Earth’s temperature from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius. Such a transformation would be, in other words, expensive<em>. </em>But almost 70 percent of Americans say they wouldn’t pay $10 every month to help cool the warming planet.</p>

<p class="content__segment combx">Duke Energy Corp. expects to spend $500 million over the next 15 years installing more than 300 megawatts worth of storage batteries on its Carolinas grid.</p>
<p class="content__segment combx">Charlotte-based Duke (NYSE: DUK) released the estimate Wednesday morning, days after <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/news/2018/10/09/duke-energy-proposes-solar-plus-storage-project.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposing its first microgrid project </a>— including a two-megawatt solar farm and a four-megawatt storage battery — for residential and business customers. That will serve the remote mountain town of Hot Springs, on the North Carolina-Tennessee border north of Asheville.</p>
<p class="content__segment combx">Duke says it plans to expand the use of batteries beyond storing and dispatching of energy. Its long-range plan includes deploying batteries for other purposes such as system balancing, increasing reliability of “end of the line” power supplies and to defer other traditional grid upgrades.</p>

<p>The indications of a warming world are numerous and hard to miss. Last year was the third-warmest year on record for both the planet and the United States — exceeded only by 2015 and 2016. In June, scientists reported that Antarctica has lost 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 — yielding “enough water to cover Texas to a depth of nearly 13 feet,” <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-antarctica-global-warming-20180613-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Associated Press reported</a>.</p>
<p>The indications of inaction on the subject are also abundant and visible. Last year, <a id="PEBSL000163" title="Donald Trump" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/donald-trump-PEBSL000163-topic.html">Donald Trump</a> pulled the United States out of the Paris agreement on greenhouse gas emissions.
