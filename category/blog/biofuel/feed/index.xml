<p>The Trump Administration has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/epa-to-pull-back-on-fuel-efficiency-standards-for-cars-trucks-in-future-model-years/2017/03/03/c4406b0c-0054-11e7-99b4-9e613afeb09f_story.html?utm_term=.1d5a2c3ea157" target="_blank">signaled its intent</a> to roll back existing federal fuel efficiency targets of 54.5 miles per gallon for model year 2022-2025 cars and light trucks, a move endorsed by U.S. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-epa-autos-dealers-idUSKBN15D11R" target="_blank">auto dealers</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-02-11/auto-ceos-ask-trump-to-revisit-obama-era-fuel-efficiency-rules" target="_blank">auto manufacturers</a>. But going in reverse on fuel efficiency would be a terrible deal for American drivers that would cost the economy approximately $800 billion while adding nearly six billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2050.</p>
<p>Energy Innovation utilized the <a href="http://energypolicy.solutions/" target="_blank">Energy Policy Simulator</a> (EPS) to analyze the effects of lowering U.S. fuel efficiency standards. The open-source computer model estimates economic and emissions impacts of various energy and environmental policy combinations using non-partisan, published data. It is freely available for public use through a user-friendly <a href="https://energypolicy.solutions/" target="_blank">web interface</a> or by downloading the full model and input dataset.</p>
<p>Our analysis compared a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario (based on existing policies as of mid-to-late 2016, including the existing fuel efficiency standards) to a scenario that freezes fuel efficiency for new passenger cars at 2017 levels</p>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/">http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/</a></p>
<h1>How Deadly Is Your Kilowatt? We Rank The Killer Energy Sources</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/jamesconca/">James Conca</a>, Contributor</p>
<p>Everyone’s heard of the carbon footprint of different energy sources, the largest footprint belonging to coal because every kWhr of energy produced emits about 900 grams of CO2. Wind and nuclear have the smallest carbon footprint with only 15 g emitted per kWhr, and that mainly from concrete production, construction, and mining of steel and uranium. Biomass is supposedly carbon neutral as it sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere before it liberates it again later, although production losses are significant depending upon the biomass.  Carbon emissions and physical footprints are known as <em>externalities</em> and are those vague someone-has-to-pay-eventually kind of thing it’s hard to put a value on. Proposed carbon footprint taxes are in the range of $15 to $40/ton of  CO2 emitted, but assigning a physical footprint cost depends on the region, ecosystem sensitivities and importance. A hundred-acre wetlands to be flooded by a new dam is worth more to the planet than a barren hundred-acre strip under a solar array in the Mojave (P. Bickel and R. Friedrich, 2005).</p>
<p>But an energy’s deathprint, as it is called, is rarely discussed. The deathprint is the number of people killed by one kind of energy or another per kWhr produced and, like the carbon footprint, coal is the worst and wind and nuclear are the best. According to the World <a href="http://www.forbes.com/health/">Health </a>Organization, the Centers for Disease Control, the National Academy of Science and many health studies over the last decade (NAS 2010), the adverse impacts on health become a significant effect for fossil fuel and biofuel/biomass sources (see especially <a href="http://nextbigfuture.com/2008/03/deaths-per-twh-for-all-energy-sources.html">Brian Wang</a> for an excellent synopsis). In fact, the WHO has called biomass burning in developing countries a major global health issue (<a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs292/en/">WHO int</a>). The table below lists the mortality rate of each energy source as deaths per trillion kWhrs produced. The numbers are a combination of actual direct deaths and epidemiological estimates, and are rounded to two significant figures.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and read. The numbers are disgusting. More tomorrow.</p>

<h1>Tesla Motors Launches Revolutionary Supercharger Enabling Convenient Long Distance Driving</h1>

Constructed in secret, Tesla revealed the locations of the  first six Supercharger stations, which will allow the Model S to travel  long distances with ultra fast charging throughout California, parts of  Nevada and Arizona.</p>
<p>The technology at the heart of the Supercharger was developed  internally and leverages the economies of scale of existing charging  technology already used by the Model S, enabling Tesla to create the  Supercharger device at minimal cost. The electricity used by the  Supercharger comes from a solar carport system provided by SolarCity,  which results in almost zero marginal energy cost after installation.  Combining these two factors, Tesla is able to provide Model S owners<sup>1</sup> free long distance travel indefinitely.</p>
<p>Each solar power system is designed to generate more energy from the  sun over the course of a year than is consumed by Tesla vehicles using  the Supercharger. This results in a slight net <em>positive</em> transfer of sunlight generated power back to the electricity grid. In  addition to lowering the cost of electricity, this addresses a commonly  held misunderstanding that charging an electric car simply pushes carbon  emissions to the power plant. The Supercharger system will always  generate more power from sunlight than Model S customers use for  driving. By adding even a small solar system at their home, electric car  owners can extend this same principle to local city driving too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The real problems with all the &#8220;stop turning corn into liquid fuel&#8221; noise in the press is that the EPA only has the authority to wave some of it. The rest of the authority belongs to the Clean Air Act and in this respect ethanol is one of the best oxygenators for the fuel which cuts smog and ozone. Added to that ethanol is a cheaper oxygenator by about a buck a gallon so I doubt seriously if the gasoline refiners will give it up. Bottom line is it is a great way to pander to growers and livestock people who have been abandoned by the House of Representatives who could not get a Farm Bill passed. But is not going to free up a lot of corn and even then it will be expensive.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/Oil/6585987">http://www.platts.com/RSSFeedDetailedNews/RSSFeed/Oil/6585987</a></p>
<h1>Texas governor asks US waive ethanol mandate on drought impact</h1>
<p>Washington (Platts)&#8211;24Aug2012/136 pm EDT/1736 GMT</p>
<p>Texas Governor Rick Perry on Friday asked the US Environmental Protection Agency to waive its ethanol mandate as a severe drought shrivels this fall&#8217;s expected corn harvest.</p>
<p>His petition marked the fifth state to formally ask EPA to alter the Renewable Fuel Standard&#8217;s requirement for blending corn-based ethanol into gasoline supplies for 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p>It comes four years after EPA rejected a similar request by Perry. He said the ramifications of this year&#8217;s drought could be worse than the conditions he cited in the 2008 petition.</p>
<p>&#8220;The forecasts are dire, as crop yield and overall productions are projected to be lower than anticipated,&#8221; Perry said in a letter to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, adding that ethanol production and the corn market have changed considerably since 2008.</p>
<p>&#8220;Requirements for ethanol derived from corn starch have increased more than 60%; meanwhile, domestic corn production in 2012 will be less than in 2008, perhaps substantially so,&#8221; he added. &#8220;In the past two years, more corn has been devoted to ethanol production than used for feed grain.&#8221;</p>

<h1>The Cellulosic Ethanol Debacle</h1>
<h2>Congress mandated purchase of 250 million gallons in 2011. Actual production: 6.6 million.</h2>
<p>&#8216;W<em>e&#8217;ll fund additional research in cutting-edge methods of  producing ethanol, not just from corn but from wood chips and stalks or  switch grass. Our goal is to make this new kind of ethanol practical and  competitive within six years.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>—George W. Bush, 2006 State of the Union address</p>
<p><a name="U503243252251C3G"></a></p>
<p>Years before the Obama Administration  dumped $70 billion into solar and wind energy and battery operated cars,  and long before anyone heard of Solyndra, President Bush launched his  own version of a green energy revolution. The future he saw was  biofuels. In addition to showering billions of dollars on corn ethanol,  Mr. Bush assured the nation that by 2012 cars and trucks could be  powered by cellulosic fuels from switch grass and other plant life.</p>
<p><a name="U5032432522511TG"></a></p>
<p>To launch this wonder-fuel industry,  the feds under Mr. Bush and President Obama have pumped at least $1.5  billion of grants and loan subsidies to fledgling producers. Mr. Bush  signed an energy bill in 2007 that established a tax credit of $1.01 per  gallon produced.</p>
<p>Most important, the Nancy Pelosi Congress passed and Mr. Bush signed a  law imposing mandates on oil companies to blend cellulosic fuel into  conventional gasoline. This guaranteed producers a market. In 2010 the  mandate was 100 million barrels, rising to 250 million in 2011 and 500  million in 2012. By the end of this decade the requirements leap to 10.5  billion gallons a year.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and read as long as you can bare it. More tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am only going to post a little bit of this article. This is so in part because I have serious trouble calling killers of humans environmentalists. Still the point is that if all the militaries in the world just quit using any fuel tomorrow the price of all those fuels would crash and stay very low in price for a very long time. So here is a very little bit of a very good article. I mean really anything that gets Inhofe to pound on his table is a very good thing indeed.</p>
<h1>The Real Reason the Military is Going Green</h1>
<div>Big Oil is a big risk for national security. Can our military—the world&#8217;s No. 1 oil guzzler—change the politics of climate change?</div>
<div></div>
<div>by <a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/@@also-by?author=Natalie+Pompilio">Natalie Pompilio</a></div>
<div>posted Jun 04, 2012</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Retired Brig. Gen. Steven Anderson calls himself  “an accidental environmentalist.”</p>
<p>His epiphany about climate change started with a tactical problem. In 2006 and 2007, when he served as the military’s chief logistician in Iraq, he coordinated the transport of millions of gallons of fuel across the country to power everything from vehicles to the large compressors used to cool individual tents—or, as Anderson puts it, for “air conditioning the desert.” He was taking one casualty for every 24 fuel convoys, and he was doing 18 convoys a day. That’s one casualty every other day. He needed to get the trucks off the road. He needed to find a way to reduce the military’s fuel use.</p>
<div>The question remains, can the weight and pragmatism of military leadership sway political leaders in Washington?</div>
<p>“There’s a direct relationship between energy and the military. The more energy consumed, the less effective you are militarily because you’re more vulnerable,” said Anderson, who reported to General David Petraeus. “They love to take out our field trucks. They make a big boom when they do.”</p>
<p>Since then, Anderson, like many military leaders, has realized that guzzling oil makes the United States vulnerable in other ways. “I’m a soldier,” Anderson said. “Why should I be concerned about climate change? Climate change brings about global instability. That makes the world more vulnerable and it’s more likely that soldiers like myself will have to fight and die somewhere.”</p>
<p>Never mind D.C. conservatives who claim to be tough on defense and suspicious of climate science: The Department of Defense isn’t denying that climate change is a major national security threat. “The change is happening. It’s just a reality,” said retired Marine Col. Mark Mykleby, a former strategy assistant to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “Science tells us it’s coming our way.”</p>

<p>Go there and read the whole thing. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pretty much for the next couple of weeks I am going to post things that strike my fancy, that float my boat, and that pique my interest. I am returning to my google whoring headline grabbing self of 2007/2008. Yes sir, I am bored and I ain&#8217;t going to take it no more. Here are some pretty pictures of some popular places that pay several thousand dollars per household per year to do pretty simple stuff.</p>

<h1>The 10 Cities That Are Most Screwed By Peak Oil</h1>

<p>Gas <a id="itxthook0" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-10-cities-that-are-most-screwed-by-peak-oil-2012-5?op=1#" rel="nofollow">prices</a> may finally be cutting into American sprawl, as <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/04/whats_going_on_us_cities_are_g.html">cities have started growing faster than suburbs </a>and <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/remember-when-americans-used-to-drive-2012-3">people are driving less than they used to</a>.</p>
<p>So what happens if gas prices keep going higher?</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t live in a <a href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-03-25/news/31235634_1_merriam-bike-route-trips">cities like Merriam, Kansas</a> without driving everywhere, as Maggie Koerth-Baker observes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470876255/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thebusiinsi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0470876255">Before the Lights Go Out</a>.</p>
<p>We looked at the cities that spend the most at the gas pump, with 2010 <a id="itxthook1" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-10-cities-that-are-most-screwed-by-peak-oil-2012-5?op=1#" rel="nofollow">data</a> from consumer data site <a href="http://www.bundle.com/">Bundle</a>. You can imagine what will happen in these places if prices double, triple or worse.</p>

<div>THIS IS THE STORY OF</div>
<div>AGRICULTURE<img decoding="async" src="http://www.farmingfirst.org/wordpress/wp-content/themes/farmingfirst2/greeneconomy/andthe.png" alt="" /> GREEN ECONOMY</div>
<div>We need to make the  global economy green.  Agriculture provides significant opportunities  for growth, investment and jobs to help make this happen.  <img decoding="async" src="http://www.farmingfirst.org/wordpress/wp-content/themes/farmingfirst2/greeneconomy/money.png" alt="" /></div>
<div>Everyone needs agriculture. Agriculture feeds  our entire population and produces fibre for clothing, feed for  livestock and bioenergy. Particularly in the developing world,  agriculture contributes significantly to GDP growth, leads the way in  poverty reduction and accounts for the lion&#8217;s share of employment  opportunities, especially for women.  Agriculture also has one of the  highest potentials for reducing carbon emissions and helping vulnerable  people adapt to climate change.</div>

<h2><a title="Permalink to Permaculture goes mainstream, hope rises" rel="bookmark" href="http://transitionhouston.wordpress.com/2011/08/01/permaculture-goes-mainstream-hope-rises/">Permaculture goes mainstream, hope rises</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes little things give hope that progress is possible, and  that maybe “if we act as communities, it might just be enough, just in  time,” to quote the <a title="Transition 101" href="http://www.transitionus.org/transition-101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheerful Disclaimer</a>.  This last week the little thing for me was the discovery of <a title="Permaculture in New York Times" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/garden/permaculture-emerges-from-the-underground.html?hpw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permaculture</a> by the <strong>New York Times</strong>.   Now, I’m not so naive to believe that seeing permaculture in the  mainstream press is going to make a lot of difference immediately,  although I wouldn’t be surprised to see a surge of interest in permie  classes across the country with long-term benefits to both participants  and the environment (FYI, classes are offered here in Houston by the <a title="Houston Permaculture Guild" href="http://www.urbanharvest.org/permaculture/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Permaculture Guild of Houston</a>, through <a title="Urban Harvest classes" href="https://www.store.urbanharvest.org/Classes.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Urban Harvest</a>).</p>
<p>I think the important point is that <em>awareness</em> is growing in  our country:  awareness of our ecosystem impacts, awareness of the lack  of sustainability in our lifestyles and economy, and also awareness of  that which is missing in our lives–community, connection, purpose.   Permaculture is a positive response to that growing awareness, as is the  permaculture-based Transition movement.</p>
<p>There are a couple of opportunities to join with others in our  Transition Houston community this week and next.  Please avail yourself  of these options to increase your awareness and find connection with a  community of folks working for a resilient Houston region.</p>
<p><strong>Transition Houston Hub meeting, Tuesday, August 2, 7:00pm to 9:00pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Green Film Series Presents Blue Gold: World Water Wars, Tuesday, August 9, 6:30pm to 9:00pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Transition Houston Hub meeting, Tuesday, August 2, 7:00pm to 9:00pm</strong><br />
We hope to see you at Tuesday’s Transition Houston meeting, which will  feature a guest speaker in addition to news from the Transition  Neighborhoods and Action Groups.</p>
<p>We are very fortunate to have <strong>Peter Wang</strong>, League of  American Bicyclists Cycling Instructor, as our guest speaker.  Peter is  considered a local biking expert.  He’s everywhere as a go-to guy for  media interviews about bikes, and has been involved in a lot of bicycle  issues.  He is risk-averse–exactly the kind of guy you would want to  help you practice being safer!–and has taught a lot of these safety  classes.</p>
<p>Peter will present a video screening followed by a discussion. The video is <em><strong>Enjoy The Ride</strong></em>, about essential bicycling skills.</p>

<h1>Canada’s Transition Communities</h1>
<div>
<div>23 								Sep</div>

<p>No 67 Posted September 23, 2010</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT UPDATE</strong>, Jan. 7, 2011: Ten *NEW* communities added to the List of Canadian Transition Communities (below).</p>
<h4>What is a Transition Community?</h4>
<p>The following text is excerpted and adapted from Ball’s research paper, <em><a href="http://transitionculture.org/wp-content/uploads/Transition-Town-Dissertation-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transition Towns: Local Networking for Global Sustainability?</a> </em></p>
<p><em></em>The Transition Movement, promoting an action-based approach  to (local) sustainability, has in the past four years grown to  incorporate a large network of individual Transition Initiatives.  Informed by ideas and values within environmental organizations, yet, in  its practical organisation it is distinct from past models of  sustainability by incorporating broad grassroots support in a diverse  range of places within the framework of a coherent networking model.</p>
<p>Sustainability challenges the dominant, market-based capitalism of  industrial society, on economic, social, environmental and ecological  grounds, citing devastating ecological and environmental exploitation. <strong>Sustainability, in contrast, calls for production and consumption within long-term ecological limits.</strong></p>
<p>While local sustainability has become a politically important goal,  in practice neither top-down government nor grassroots community models  have gained widespread uptake or success: the former have failed to  connect with or involve a grassroots public; the latter generally have  few resources and limited capacity.</p>
<p>The Transition Model, a non-governmental community-led model,  advances an action-based approach. With its fast-growing network of  Initiatives, <strong>the Transition Movement is akin to a non-profit  franchise operation, combining the advantage of a centralized support  base with the capacity and resources of a decentralized networking  organization.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transition concept, co-founded by Rob Hopkins, who has a  background in permaculture, builds upon a core thesis: that the modern  industrial capitalist economic and social system, based upon cheap oil  and resources, is unsustainable, making a major restructuring of economy  and society imperative, and inevitable</strong>. Transition contends  that citizens and communities need to act proactively and positively at  the local scale, in a process of ‘Transition’ and ‘<em><a href="http://richardheinberg.com/bookshelf/powerdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Powerdown</a></em>’ to build localized and resilient communities in terms of food, energy, work and waste. <strong>The  vision holds that decarbonized local communities will be resilient in  their capacity to “hold together and maintain their ability to function  in the face of change and shock from the outside.” Transition is  modelled to be a self-organizing community-led model, for people to “act  now and act collectively.”</strong></p>
