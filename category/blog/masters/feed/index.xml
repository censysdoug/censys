										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just like CANCER. That was the first thought I had when I read this article. Evidence was gathered 60 years ago. People spoke up, and the oil and gas industry killed any discussion. Now we are stuck with more powerful Hurricanes. We are stuck with the American west being consumed by droughts and fire. The Arctic is gone and the Antarctic going. The world should confiscate their wealth and apply every dime to remediating the effects. Unfortunately the whole world never does anything. I mean the UN could pass a resolution but Pfffhh.</p>

<p class="dcr-s23rjr"><span class="dcr-114to15"><span class="dcr-1jnp7wy">I</span></span><span class="dcr-s23rjr">n August 1974, the CIA produced a study on “climatological research as it pertains to intelligence problems”. The diagnosis was dramatic. It warned of the emergence of a new era of weird weather, leading to political unrest and mass migration (which, in turn, would cause more unrest). The new era the agency imagined wasn’t necessarily one of hotter temperatures; the CIA had heard from scientists warning of global cooling as well as warming. But the direction in which the thermometer was traveling wasn’t their immediate concern; it was the political impact. They knew that the so-called “<a title="" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/29/little-ice-age" data-link-name="in body link">little ice age</a>”, a series of cold snaps between, roughly, 1350 and 1850, had brought not only drought and famine, but also war – and so could these new climatic changes.</span></p>
<p class="dcr-s23rjr">“The climate change began in 1960,” the report’s first page informs us, “but no one, including the climatologists, recognized it.” Crop failures in the Soviet Union and India in the early 1960s had been attributed to standard unlucky weather. The US shipped grain to India and the Soviets killed off livestock to eat, “and premier Nikita Khrushchev was quietly deposed”.</p>
<p class="dcr-s23rjr">But, the report argued, the world ignored this warning, as the global population continued to grow and states made massive investments in energy, technology and medicine.</p>

One I never thought would happen until the END. And I will be honest here, we are nowhere near the end. I think we have at least 20 years before things are completely out of control. I never thought I hear these kinds of statement until it was too late. Like hearing &#8220;the Titanic is sinking&#8221; when it is already half way down and there is no going back.

<p>An emergency is a serious situation that requires immediate action. When someone calls 911 because they can’t breathe, that’s an emergency. When someone stumbles on the sidewalk because their chest is pounding and their lips are turning blue, that’s an emergency. Both people require help right away. Multiply those individuals by millions of people who have similar symptoms, and it constitutes the biggest global health emergency in a century: the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Now consider the following scenarios: A hurricane blasts Florida. A California dam bursts because floods have piled water high up behind it. A sudden, record-setting cold snap cuts power to the entire state of Texas. These are also emergencies that require immediate action. Multiply these situations worldwide, and you have the biggest environmental emergency to beset the earth in millennia: climate change.</p>
<p>Given the circumstances,<em> Scientific American</em> has agreed with major news outlets worldwide to start using the term “climate emergency” in its coverage of climate change. An official statement about this decision, and the impact we hope it can have throughout the media landscape, is below.</p>
<p><em>The planet is heating up way too fast. It’s time for journalism to recognize that the climate emergency is here</em></p>

<h2 class="wsite-content-title">Hydrologic History of the Tulare Basin</h2>
<div></div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Tulare Basin historically supported an amazing complex of wetland habitats, unique in the world. This largely flat and arid region served as the floodplain for water flowing west from the southern Sierra Nevada, north from the Transverse Ranges, as well as from small intermittent arroyos flowing east from the Coast Ranges. Oak woodlands and riparian forests formed green corridors across the broad prairie on the eastern edge of the Tulare Basin. Freshwater tule marshes and alkaline wetlands adorned the slow-moving sloughs and shallow margins of Kern, Buena Vista, Goose, Tulare, and Summit lakes. Emergent marsh vegetation, such as tules and cattails, grew in permanent standing water at the shallow edges of freshwater wetlands. Upslope from the marshes, water intermittently flooded iodine bush scrub and alkali grassland habitats.</p>
<p>This highly-productive, shallow water system supported abundant populations of endemic lake-adapted fishes such that American white pelicans (Pelacanus erythrorhynchos) nested by the thousands on islands in Tulare Lake and Buena Vista Lake. The Tulare Basin&#8217;s extensive wetland habitats historically attracted significant numbers of resident and migratory waterbirds, including grebes, pelicans, cormorants, herons, egrets, ibises, geese, swans, ducks, rails, sandhill cranes, plovers, stilts, avocets, sandpipers, phalaropes, gulls, and terns.</p>
<p>The conversion of this water system to a lake-and-slough wetland to agriculture began in the mid-1800s when European settlers began to build canals and diversion structures to irrigate their crops.  This early irrigation infrastructure upstream from Tulare Lake slowly cut off the lake from its source waters, shrinking the lake&#8217;s footprint.  By 1899 &#8211; less than 50 years after irrigation was initiated &#8211; Tulare Lake went dry for the first time in history.</p>

<p>The major currents in the Atlantic Ocean help control the climate by moving warm surface waters north and south from the equator, with colder deep water pushing back toward the equator from the poles. The presence of that warm surface water plays a key role in moderating the climate in the North Atlantic, giving places like the UK a far more moderate climate than its location—the equivalent of northern Ontario—would otherwise dictate.</p>
<p>But the temperature differences that drive that flow are expected to fade as our climate continues to warm. A bit over a decade ago, measurements of the currents seemed to be indicating that temperatures were dropping, suggesting that we might be seeing these predictions come to pass. But a few years later, it became clear that there was just too much year-to-year variation for us to tell.</p>
<p>Over time, however, researchers have figured out ways of getting indirect measures of the currents, using material that is influenced by the strengths of the water&#8217;s flow. These measures have now let us look back on the current&#8217;s behavior over the past several centuries. And the results confirm that the strength of the currents has dropped dramatically over the last century.</p>

<p>MOSCOW (AP) — Belarus&#8217; first nuclear power plant began operating Tuesday, a project that has spooked its neighbor Lithuania, which immediately cut off importing electricity from Belarus at the news.</p>
<p>The Russian-built Astravyets nuclear power plant, 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, has been connected to Belarus&#8217; power grid and has started producing electricity, according to Belarusian electricity operator Belenergo.</p>
<p>Lithuanian authorities long have opposed the plant&#8217;s construction, arguing that the project has been plagued by accidents, stolen materials and the mistreatment of workers. In line with the country&#8217;s law banning electricity imports from Belarus once the plant starts, Lithuania&#8217;s Litgrid power operator cut the inflow of electricity from Belarus upon receiving data that the Astravyets nuclear reactor had started producing energy.</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s state nuclear corporation Rosatom, which built the plant, has rejected the Lithuanian complaints, saying the plant&#8217;s design conforms to the highest international standards as confirmed by the International Atomic Energy Agency, a U.N. watchdog.</p>

His editorial is so wrong in so many ways. Yes, we ARE causing the next big extinction by habitat destruction and this pandemic is a perfect result of that habitat destruction and it&#8217;s results. Global warming IS the biggest crisis facing humans. Its true &#8211; not the biggest crisis facing the Earth cause after we are gone and all the smoke gets reabsorbed the Earth will be just fine. This guy is raising money by spreading feel good skepticism (and that&#8217;s all it is) and making himself famous by telling lies.</p>

<p class="">On behalf of environmentalists everywhere, I would like to formally apologize for the climate scare we created over the last 30 years. Climate change is happening. It’s just not the end of the world. It’s not even our most serious environmental problem.</p>
<p class="">I may seem like a strange person to be saying all of this. I have been a climate activist for 20 years and an environmentalist for 30.</p>
<p class="">But as an energy expert asked by Congress to provide objective expert testimony, and invited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to serve as Expert Reviewer of its next Assessment Report, I feel an obligation to apologize for how badly we environmentalists have misled the public.</p>
<p class="">Here are some facts few people know:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p class="">Humans are <em>not</em> causing a “sixth mass extinction”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">The Amazon is <em>not</em> “the lungs of the world”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Climate change is <em>not</em> making natural disasters worse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Fires have <em>declined </em>25% around the world since 2003</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">The amount of land we use for meat — humankind’s biggest use of land — has<em> declined</em> <em>by an area nearly as large as Alaska</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">The build-up of wood fuel and more houses near forests, <em>not</em> climate change, explain why there are more, and more dangerous, fires in Australia and California</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Carbon emissions are declining in most rich nations and have been declining in Britain, Germany, and France since the mid-1970s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Netherlands became rich not poor while adapting to life below sea level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">We produce 25% more food than we need and food surpluses will continue to rise as the world gets hotter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Habitat loss and the direct killing of wild animals are bigger threats to species than climate change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Wood fuel is far worse for people and wildlife than fossil fuels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="">Preventing future pandemics requires more not less “industrial” agriculture</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Former Vice President <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/id/10000451">Joe Biden</a> released a sprawling plan Tuesday to revamp American infrastructure and energy to both curb climate change and spur economic growth.</p>
<p>The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee’s proposal aims to achieve carbon-free power generation by 2035. As the coronavirus pandemic leaves the U.S. mired in an economic crisis, Biden said he will set out to create “millions” of union jobs that pay at least $15 per hour as the U.S. overhauls its roads, bridges, trains, auto industry and broadband system.</p>
<div class="BoxInline-container  ">
<div id="BoxInline-ArticleBody-6" class="BoxInline-container" data-module="mps-slot"></div>
</div>
<p>The plan, which comes days after a joint task force formed by the Biden and Sen. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/bernie-sanders/">Bernie Sanders</a> campaigns outlined a climate change agenda, sets out a more ambitious approach to developing clean energy than the Biden campaign did during the Democratic primary. It calls for $2 trillion in spending over four years, more than the $1.7 trillion the campaign previously proposed to spend over a decade.</p>
<p>“Even if we weren’t facing a pandemic and an economic crisis, we should be making these investments anyway,” Biden said of the plan during remarks in Delaware. He called the investments “critical” for the economy and public health.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald J. Trump is the worst energy President of all time. That takes a lot of doing. Jimmie Carter was real bad on Nuclear Power. George Bush was seriously bad on natural gas and oil. But this alleged policy maker pledged, during the the 2016 campaign, that he would SAVE coal. Under his Presidency the Coal Market has plummeted as has its usage. Even though foreign markets were promised, they have plunged too. Oil futures at one point were trading in negative territory for the first time ever and Nuclear Power Plants are closing. He is opposed to Wind and Solar as they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFHh0Rs34v0">spread across the land</a>. I have a wind turbine within 15 minutes of my house in Riverton and I have a house with total roof solar panels around the corner from me. That says to me that the Cheeto Burito is about to lose office. We shall see.</p>

<p>MARION — Southern Illinois Power Cooperative plans to retire its largest coal-fired generator as early as this fall, a move that is expected to save $125 million over a decade.</p>
</div>
<div class="lee-article-text">
<p>President and CEO Don Gulley said the tentative decision is the result of analysis and negotiations that have been ongoing since late 2019. Gulley said SIPC utilized outside consultants to help it perform a comprehensive review of operations and determine the best path forward. The decision to close Unit 4, as it is known, was based on two primary factors, he said: sustained low energy prices in the wholesale power market, and increasingly costly environmental regulations for coal-fired generators.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Generation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Generation</a></p>
<p>They were the Great Destroyers of the Earth. If you were an alien and you flew by in 1944, What would you see? Mass destruction everywhere. If you knew nothing of Earth&#8217;s politics you would conclude that <strong>everyone</strong> on Earth was conspiring to to destroy it. Ruined cities, smashed food systems, and destroyed food supplies. Men and Women in chains; babies slaughtered.</p>
<p>If you flew by 60 years later (a blink of an alien eye), say on a return trip, what would you see? A continued pattern of destruction. Befouled air. Fossil Fuels being sucked out of the ground and spewed everywhere, including most destructively, the Oceans. Food systems collapsing. Filth piled in heaps and buried or burned. Men and Women in chains; children being caged, trafficked, and killed. What would you conclude? That a Generation of Destroyers was coming to its &#8220;natural&#8221; conclusion.</p>
<p>Greatest Generation? Hardly. Then there is Nuclear Power &#8211; which they created and they used. Think about it.</p>
<p>I rarely write original material. But after seeing the current National Geographical article on Veterans I could not help myself.</p>

<p>Go there and read.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chernobyl and Fukushima released a lot of radiation. People died from the severe radiation released just after the accident, but &#8220;mild&#8221; consistent radiation is not dangerous to animals though it may have mild effects on adults and bigger effects on children. But the idea that a major radiation release would create one eyed giant humans or fire breathing dragons like wadzzilla is really remote. The fear of radiation has done some pretty amazing things for the environment, however.</p>

<h2 class="dbjv4gk">Researchers thought the site of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster was unable to support life. But a bunch of wolves, deer, wild boars, bears, and foxes disagree.</h2>

Wild animals in Chernobyl <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/572589/chernobyl-nuclear-disaster-site-thriving-wildlife" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">are flourishing</a> within the contaminated region; <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/571660/chernobyl-disaster-puppies-adopted-in-north-america" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">puppies</a> roaming the area are capturing the hearts of thousands. <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/585497/chernobyl-miniseries-prompts-spike-travel-chernobyl-exclusion-zone" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tourists</a> who have watched the critically acclaimed HBO series <em>Chernobyl</em> are <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/585692/chernobyl-creator-urges-exclusion-zone-visitors-to-behave" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">taking selfies</a> with the ruins. Once thought to be forever uninhabitable, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has become a haven for flora and fauna that prove that life, as they say in <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/49904/20-things-you-might-not-have-known-about-jurassic-park" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Jurassic Park</em></a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/oijEsqT2QKQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finds a way</a>.</p>
<h2 class="body title">1. The Animals of Chernobyl Survived Against All Odds</h2>
<p class="body">The effects of the radioactive explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on April 26, 1986 devastated the environment. Around the plant and in the nearby city of Pripyat in Ukraine, the Chernobyl disaster’s radiation caused the leaves of thousands of trees to turn a rust color, giving a new name to the surrounding woods—the <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/56235-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-33-years-later-wildlife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Forest</a>. Workers eventually bulldozed and buried the radioactive trees. Squads of Soviet conscripts also were ordered to <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-happened-to-the-dogs-of-chernobyl-the-harrowing-events-of-the-tv-series-are-sadly-true-17928470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoot</a> any stray animals within the 1000-square-mile Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Though experts today believe parts of the zone will remain unsafe for humans for another <a href="https://www.livescience.com/39961-chernobyl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20,000 years</a>, numerous animal and plant species not only survived, but thrived.</p>
<h2 class="body title">2. Bears and Wolves Outnumber Humans Around the Chernobyl Disaster Site</h2>
<p class="body">While humans are strictly prohibited from living in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, many other species have settled there. Brown bears, wolves, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/33677/canada-lynx-ghost-cat-north" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">lynx</a>, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59248/whats-difference-between-bison-and-buffalo" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">bison</a>, deer, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59461/10-gigantic-facts-about-moose" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">moose</a>, beavers, foxes, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64760/10-resourceful-facts-about-badgers" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">badgers</a>, wild boar, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/70797/12-surprising-facts-about-raccoon-dogs" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">raccoon dogs</a>, and more than 200 species of birds have formed their own ecosystem within the Chernobyl disaster area. Along with the larger animals, a variety of amphibians, fish, worms, and bacteria makes the unpopulated environment their home.</p>
