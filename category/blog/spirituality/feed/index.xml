<p>Youth Climate Strike</p>
<p>March 15, 2019</p>
<p>(Pictures Below!)</p>
<p>While the government and a majority of the adults piss away the future reveling in their short-term goals and lives, the youth are protesting and striking the prospects of a very bleak future left as legacy by mainly the powers that be who have ignored the climate crisis for over 50 years.  Scientists world-wide have warned us and warned us that now we have only about 11 years left to truly embark on a road to zero carbon emissions because of the very real threat of global warming, death to species and oceans, and permafrost melting, leading to the release of many ancient diseases and the heat up of the atmosphere leading to crop failure, sea level rise, and billions of deaths in our near future and a collapse of the ecosystem that supports all life on this planet.</p>
<p>What the youth demand is at least a Green New Deal or an honest effort by the leaders to truly take on the problem of global warming.  The need to do so has never been more urgent.  There are also some among us adults that stand with our youth and are in solidarity with their efforts to strike from going to school until the leaders listen to the truly educated.</p>

<p><span class="post__authors"><a class="post__linked-author" href="https://theoutline.com/contributor/493/arimeta-diop">Arimeta Diop</a></span> Mar—19—2019 03:26PM EST</p>
<p>Last Friday, students across 110 countries walked out of their classes in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/19/school-climate-strikes-more-than-1-million-took-part-say-campaigners-greta-thunberg">the massive Youth Climate Strike</a> to bring attention to the effects of climate change. Hundreds of students filled New York’s City Hall Park, the air thrumming with excitement and anxiety. Some even hung from the lamp posts to get  a better view of the swarming crowd before police inevitably invited them to climb down. It was the first protest I’ve been to where children far outnumbered adults.</p>
<p>“I’m here because I don’t want to have to grow up in a world where I am terrified the people I love could lose their home,” Simone Rubin, a senior at NEST+M high school, told <em>The Outline</em>, referencing <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/03/bill-de-blasio-my-new-plan-to-climate-proof-lower-manhattan.html">the potential affect sea level rise</a> could have on <a href="https://www.dec.ny.gov/energy/45202.html">New York City’s coast</a>. “It’s unfair that we’re in this situation now because adults refuse to act and now we’re tasked with cleaning up an earth that we shouldn’t have had to do because we shouldn’t have put ourselves in this situation to begin with.”</p>
<p>The Youth Climate Strike was born out of the #FridaysforFuture demonstrations started by 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. In August 2018, Thunberg started skipping school each Friday to protest outside of the Stockholm Parliament House, calling on leaders to prioritize environmental issues. Thunberg’s notoriety grew as she spoke at the U.N. climate talks last December, and the #FridaysforFuture hashtag received more and more attention. She’s since <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47568227">been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize</a> for her activism.</p>

<p id="sDgYHm">If the recent <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/10/8/17948832/climate-change-global-warming-un-ipcc-report">report</a> from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is to be believed, humanity has just over a decade to get carbon emissions under control before catastrophic climate change impacts become unavoidable.</p>
<p id="aPnLpx">The Republican Party generally ignores or denies that problem. But the Democratic Party claims to accept and understand it.</p>
<p id="BzJYTN">It is odd, then, that Democrats <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/11/there-is-no-democratic-plan-to-fight-climate-change/543981/">do not have a plan to address climate change</a>.</p>
<p id="VWNRRQ">Their last big plan — the American Clean Energy and Security Act — passed the House in 2009 but went on to die an unceremonious death before reaching the Senate floor. Since then, there’s been nothing to replace it.</p>
<p id="ASAlPz">Plenty of Democratic politicians support policies that would reduce climate pollution — renewable energy tax credits, fuel economy standards, and the like — but those policies do not add up to a comprehensive solution, certainly nothing like what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggests is necessary.</p>
<p id="SDT6KP">Young activists, who will be forced to live with the ravages of climate change, find this upsetting. So they have proposed a plan of their own. It’s called the Green New Deal (GND) — a term purposefully reminiscent of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s original New Deal in the 1930s — and it has become the talk of the town. Here are Google searches from the past few months:</p>

<h1>Warren Buffett and casino boss Sheldon Adelson clash in Nevada over electricity</h1>
<p>by Trevor Hunnicutt</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong> | Casino magnate <a href="https://www.afr.com/news/world/north-america/elon-musk-just-gave-almost-us40000-to-republicanallied-group-20180715-h12q03">Sheldon Adelson</a> and investor <a href="https://www.afr.com/personal-finance/why-warren-buffett-likes-apple-20180930-h162k3">Warren Buffett</a> are set for a desert showdown over electricity next week as the two billionaires&#8217; interests collide on election ballots in Nevada.</p>
<p>At issue in the November 6 election is the cost and control of power from the neon lights shining on the Las Vegas Strip to the state&#8217;s gold mines.</p>
<p data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen-7770372_137="3869" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time-7770372_137="4000" data-gtm-vis-has-fired-7770372_137="1">A measure supported by Republican donor Adelson, who is also Las Vegas Sands Corp&#8217;s chairman, would force state legislators to break up control over much of the state&#8217;s electricity in effect held by a unit of Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway, NV Energy. It would allow customers to choose their own power provider by 2023.</p>
<p>Buffett has supported liberal causes and backed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p>
<p>Unlike previous western duels, both sides in Nevada are showing up with cash. The energy tussle is shaping up as one of the more costly of an election season in which Democrats are trying to wrest control of at least one chamber of US Congress from Republicans.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and decide for yourself. More next week.:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All the capitalists care about is the money. So what if somebody dies making the power? So what if making the power kills someone? As long as they get their 100,000K profit or whatever it is. The numbers really have to mount before they even notice. Who cares if a &#8220;little person&#8221; dies, they were just taking up space anyway.</p>
<p>NOW this is a refreshing perspective.</p>

Replacing fossil fuels with <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate2771" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wind and solar energy</a>, research shows, can <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduce risks of asthma, hospitalizations and heart attacks</a>.

</div>
<div class="Raw-s1p4r1tl-0 jioFUO">
<p>So my colleagues and I calculated the health impact of generating electricity through <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/5/25/17393156/offshore-wind-us-massachusetts-rhode-island-zinke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offshore wind turbines</a> – which until now the U.S. has barely begun to do.</p>

<p>PANA – Apparently building a moonbuggy wasn’t hard enough.</p>
<p>Pana High School students this year are setting out to build a solar-powered car from scratch and race it across Texas to California as part of the <a href="http://www.solarcarchallenge.org/challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 Solar Car Challenge</a>.</p>
<p>Building the battery-powered four-wheeled rovers that Apollo astronauts used on the moon in the early 1970s is a tradition at Pana.</p>
<p>But industrial arts teacher Steve Bonser said students learned about the solar car challenge this summer and decided to give it a shot — despite being warned it wouldn’t be easy.</p>
<p>“The kids voted unanimously to up the game and take on a lot more work and build this solar car,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Starting to take shape</strong></p>
<p>The framework of what will hopefully become a solar-powered car is beginning to take shape in the shop at the junior high school.</p>
<p>Bonser said the students have finished most of the design work and constructed the frame for the 8-foot long car. The goal is to have the entire vehicle, which will be street legal, finished in March.</p>
<p>Still early on in the process, Bonser said, the school was fortunate Battery Specialists in Taylorville donated a golf cart, which will provide some parts.</p>
<div class="ad-container"> The school also acquired solar panels that will power the battery. But much of how it will all come together is still an unknown.</div>
</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the new spirit of this BLOG I am only going to post articles that get my heart pumping and my blood flowing. Without further adieu I present SciencePlus.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencesplus.ca/en/resource/1503">http://www.sciencesplus.ca/en/resource/1503</a></p>
<h1>What&#8217;s New for Renewable Energy</h1>
<p>Energy drives social and economic development. In the past, the discovery of oil triggered an unprecedented industrial revolution that had significant impacts on our quality of life. A single litre of oil provides as many calories as two to twenty weeks of human labour, enough energy to fuel our growing industries, heat our homes, and get us from point A to point B quickly.</p>
<hr />
<p>However, with an alarming scarcity of fossil fuels and growing energy demands on the horizon, especially for emerging economies, the search for sustainable means of production is not only imperative for the preservation of the environment—it is also becoming highly lucrative. That is why renewable energy is receiving more and more attention from governments and businesses. There is talk of a new industrial revolution, one that is all about green energy.</p>
<p>Since the Kyoto Protocol, most countries have increased the proportion of their budget invested in energy with the potential for long-term sustainability. We can already see results; even in 2006, 18.6% of the world&#8217;s electricity came from renewable resources. Of that percentage, hydraulic energy (hydroelectric dams, underwater turbines, tidal power plants, etc.) constituted 89%, biomass constituted 5.7%, and wind power, geothermal energy, and solar power constituted 3.5%, 1.7%, and 0.2%, respectively.</p>

<p>This is a huge site. Go there and read. More next week.</p>

<p>With all the recent talk at the federal level about the EPA’s proposed carbon regulations for new and existing power plants, it’s easy to forget about the executives that have front row seats to cutting American carbon pollution. And though climate deniers <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/06/26/2202141/the-anti-science-climate-denier-caucus-113th-congress-edition/">run rampant</a> through the halls of Congress, a <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate-guide-governors/">new analysis</a> from the CAP Action War Room reveals that half of America’s Republican governors agree with the anti-science caucus of Congress.</p>
<p>Fifteen out of twenty-nine sitting Republican governors deny climate science despite the overwhelming level of <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/05/15/2014211/study-finds-97-consensus-on-human-caused-global-warming-in-the-peer-reviewed-literature/">scientific consensus</a>, the <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/report/2013/09/12/73895/states-of-denial-states-with-the-most-federal-disaster-aid-sent-climate-science-deniers-to-congress-2/">enormous cost to taxpayers</a>, and the critical place governors occupy in implementing new limits on carbon pollution. None of the country’s Democratic governors have made public statements denying climate change.</p>
<p>This map from the analysis categorizes governors into four groups: green for those who both accept climate science and are taking action to fight climate change; orange for those who either accept or haven’t openly denied climate science, but also have yet to take serious action to address climate change; red for those who have failed to take action or openly rejected to federal safeguards to address climate change, and red with stripes for climate deniers.</p>
