										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a travesty on so many levels. First at the corporate level, who ran this company into the ground? I mean seriously there are all kind of remedies for years, including burying power lines, and cladding power lines or leasing solar on customers roofs. To not do anything but take profit for thirty years should get someone jail time. Second, what about the employees? The Camp Fire was cause my a Power Pole that was ONE HUNDRED years old. Why did someone not take the damn thing down on their own initiative? Again &#8211; Jail Time. Where were the regulators? That should have made them create a revitalization and safety plans 30 years ago. Again &#8211; Jail Time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I am writing this to avoid writing about the worst piece of Illinois energy legislation in my lifetime. But it is true that this is a great way to save energy and extend the life of your equipment. In addition the site has other useful cleaning tips.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/cleaning/worst-cleaning-jobs-made-easy/cleaning-behind-under-refrigerator">http://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/cleaning/worst-cleaning-jobs-made-easy/cleaning-behind-under-refrigerator</a></p>
<h1 class="lead-headline">The Worst Cleaning Jobs Made Easy</h1>
<h2 class="slide-title">Dirty Job No. 7: Cleaning Behind and Under the Refrigerator</h2>
<p><strong>Time it takes:</strong> 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Lots of dust on the coils can cause a refrigerator to run inefficiently. And dust under the refrigerator can mix with moisture from the air to gum up the finish on your floor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Pull out the refrigerator by grasping both sides and gently wiggling it toward you; some are on wheels, so this may be easier than you think. When you can, reach behind and pull the plug (your food will survive for the short time it takes to clean). If you have an ice maker, shut off the water supply first, just in case the hose comes loose.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To dislodge dust around the condenser coils (the wriggly apparatus in back), use a long, thin tool known as a refrigerator-coil brush (Rubbermaid, $9, <a href="http://www.acehardware.com/product/index.jsp?productId=1279693" target="_blank">acehardware.com</a>), then gently vacuum with a brush attachment. Some refrigerators have their condenser coils behind a removable grille in the front. If yours does, snap off or unscrew the grille and clean the coils, as above.</p>

<p>Go there, read and get clean. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now the hottest things in the energy conservation world  or at least in the lighting world are LED lights. They come in all shapes and sizes. In fact I have one that I use as a flashlight, but it was intended to be a safety head light for my bicycle. It has been amazingly helpful. This is a complex subject so it will take me a few weeks to get it all posted. But here is a start.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode</a></p>
<h1 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en"><span dir="auto">Light-emitting diode</span></h1>
<p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <b>light-emitting diode</b> (<b>LED</b>) is a two-lead <a title="Semiconductor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor">semiconductor</a> <a class="mw-redirect" title="Light source" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_source">light source</a>. It is a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Pn-junction" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pn-junction">pn-junction</a> <a title="Diode" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode">diode</a>, which emits light when activated.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> When a suitable <a title="Voltage" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage">voltage</a> is applied to the leads, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Electrons" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrons">electrons</a> are able to recombine with <a class="mw-redirect" title="Electron holes" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_holes">electron holes</a> within the device, releasing energy in the form of <a title="Photon" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon">photons</a>. This effect is called <a title="Electroluminescence" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroluminescence">electroluminescence</a>, and the color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photon) is determined by the energy <a title="Band gap" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_gap">band gap</a> of the semiconductor.</p>
<p>An LED is often small in area (less than 1 mm<sup>2</sup>) and integrated optical components may be used to shape its <a title="Radiation pattern" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pattern">radiation pattern</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Appearing as practical electronic components in 1962,<sup id="cite_ref-LemelsonMIT_8-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode#cite_note-LemelsonMIT-8">[8]</a></sup> the earliest LEDs emitted low-intensity infrared light. Infrared LEDs are still frequently used as transmitting elements in remote-control circuits, such as those in remote controls for a wide variety of consumer electronics. The first visible-light LEDs were also of low intensity, and limited to red. Modern LEDs are available across the <a title="Visible spectrum" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum">visible</a>, <a title="Ultraviolet" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a>, and <a title="Infrared" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared">infrared</a> wavelengths, with very high brightness.</p>
<p>Early LEDs were often used as indicator lamps for electronic devices, replacing small incandescent bulbs. They were soon packaged into numeric readouts in the form of <a title="Seven-segment display" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display">seven-segment displays</a>, and were commonly seen in digital clocks.</p>
<p>Recent developments in LEDs permit them to be used in environmental and task lighting. LEDs have many advantages over incandescent light sources including lower energy consumption, longer lifetime, improved physical robustness, smaller size, and faster switching. Light-emitting diodes are now used in applications as diverse as <a title="Navigation light" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_light#Aviation_navigation_lights">aviation lighting</a>, <a title="Automotive lighting" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_lighting#Light_emitting_diodes_.28LED.29">automotive headlamps</a>, advertising, <a title="Lighting" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighting">general lighting</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" title="Traffic signal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_signal">traffic signals</a>, and camera flashes. However, LEDs powerful enough for room lighting are still relatively expensive, and require more precise current and heat management than compact <a title="Fluorescent lamp" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_lamp">fluorescent lamp</a> sources of comparable output.</p>
<p>LEDs have allowed new text, video displays, and sensors to be developed, while their high switching rates are also useful in advanced communications technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know that going from commenting on falling oil prices (and they are still dropping) to talking about a range for cooking in your kitchen will produce screeching sounds from some readers. But I felt a need to get back to this blog&#8217;s roots in the residential  housing market so I will just plunge ahead. In my real life I prefer natural gas stoves because I am good with them and not so good with electric. Still if you are like my brother Mike and trapped in an all electric house then this would be the way to go.</p>

<div class="social pull-left">
<p>While America continues to burn gas, induction cooking is bringing the heat to much of the rest of the world. It cooks faster than other methods, is fantastically energy efficient, and is safer too, since there&#8217;s no direct heat. The wares on display at IFA 2013 hint at a creative future for this magnetic cooking technology—a future that hopefully includes the US.</p>
<p>Most induction cooktops are monolithic black slabs—a tried and true design that looks pretty good in most kitchens. But Chinese manufacturer Midea offers up a brighter take on induction design. The company showcased a handful of colorful cookers, from yellow to pink. They might not look so out of place in a retro-inspired kitchen.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="article">The handful of induction cooktops available in the US tend to have fixed zones to fit different pots and pans. If the cookware slips out of the zone, then it won&#8217;t cook. But tons of European manufacturers, including big names like Bosch and Electrolux, showed off induction hobs with &#8220;flex&#8221; cooking areas.</span></p>

<h1>Europe&#8217;s Clothes Dryers Consume Half As Much Energy As America&#8217;s</h1>
<p>Like the vast majority of U.S. households, I own a <a class="zem_slink" title="Clothes dryer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothes_dryer" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia noopener">clothes dryer</a> that accounts for a non-trivial share of my <a class="zem_slink" title="Electricity" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia noopener">electricity</a> consumption. Like the vast majority of my fellow Americans, I would likely pay a lot less to dry my clothes if I lived in Europe.</p>
<p>Based on a new study by <a href="http://www.ecova.com/">Ecova</a>, an <a class="zem_slink" title="Energy" href="http://www.wikinvest.com/industry/Energy" target="_blank" rel="wikinvest noopener">energy</a> consulting firm in Spokane, WA, <a class="zem_slink" title="Europe" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia noopener">Europe’s</a> embrace of new <a class="zem_slink" title="Heat pump" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia noopener">heat pump</a> technologies is largely responsible for the transatlantic disparity in the energy efficiency of clothes dryers. Unlike Europe, heat pump technology has yet to arrive in <a class="zem_slink" title="North America" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=48.1666666667,-100.166666667&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=48.1666666667,-100.166666667%20%28North%20America%29&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation noopener">North America</a>.</p>
<p>There are 87 million residential dryers in the U.S. These clothes dryers account for 6% of residential electricity consumption, which is roughly equivalent to the electricity consumed annually by the entire <a class="zem_slink" title="Massachusetts" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=42.3,-71.8&amp;spn=3.0,3.0&amp;q=42.3,-71.8%20%28Massachusetts%29&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation noopener">state of Massachusetts</a> (60 billion <a class="zem_slink" title="Kilowatt hour" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt_hour" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia noopener">kWh</a> per year). The annual cost of operating <a class="zem_slink" title="United States" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=38.8833333333,-77.0166666667&amp;spn=10.0,10.0&amp;q=38.8833333333,-77.0166666667%20%28United%20States%29&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation noopener">America</a>‘s clothes dryers adds up to about $9 billion.</p>
<p>The energy efficiency of North American clothes dryers has made at most modest gains over the past two decades. By contrast, the energy attributed to washer use has decreased by about 70% since 1992.</p>
<p>Ecova compared the energy consumption of currently available European heat pump dryers to North American conventional electric dryers spanning a wide range of sizes, prices, features, and manufacturers.</p>

<h1>Drought eases in U.S. Midwest, worsens in northern Plains</h1>
<div id="articleInfo">
<p>By Karl Plume</p>
<p>Thu Aug 30, 2012 9:30pm IST</p>
</div>
<p>(Reuters) &#8211; The worst U.S. drought in a half century loosened its grip on the Midwest in the past week, helped by rain and cooler temperatures, but the drought grew more dire in the northern Plains, a report from climate experts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>But the improved Midwest weather arrived too late for crops in major farm states such as Kansas, Iowa, Illinois and Indiana, where severe corn and soybean yield losses have already been realized.</p>
<p>The portion of the contiguous United States suffering from at least &#8220;severe&#8221; drought fell to 42.34 percent from 44.03 percent over the prior week, according to the Drought Monitor, a weekly synthesis representing a consensus climatologists.</p>
<p>The percentage of the Midwest in that category slipped to 49.96 from 51.06 the previous week, with the most notable improvement in Indiana, 64.07 percent of which was under severe drought or worse, down from 81.48 percent a week ago.</p>

<h1>In drought, drillers offering even water witching</h1>
<p>Well driller Randy Gebke usually uses a geology database and other  high-tech tools to figure out where to sink new water wells for clients.  But if asked, he&#8217;ll grab two wires, walk across the property, waiting  for the wires to cross to find a place to drill.</p>

<p>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. —</p>
<p>Well driller Randy Gebke usually uses a geology  database and other high-tech tools to figure out where to sink new water  wells for clients. But if asked, he&#8217;ll grab two wires, walk across the  property, waiting for the wires to cross to find a place to drill.</p>
<p>Gebke is water witching, using an ancient method with a greater connection to superstition than science.</p>
<p>Thousands of wells have gone dry this summer in the worst drought the  nation has experienced in decades. Some homeowners are spending as much  as $30,000 to have new ones drilled, and Gebke said most potential  customers in his area expect water witching to be part the deal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over 50 percent of the time in that conversation, they ask do we  have a witcher on the crew,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And my response is, `We have a  witcher on every crew.'&#8221;</p>

<h1>Tropical Storm Isaac could bring welcome rain to Midwest but unlikely to break drought</h1>
<div>
<h3>By  Associated Press,</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>OMAHA, Neb. — The remnants of  Tropical Storm Isaac could bring welcome rain to some states in the  Mississippi River valley this week, but experts say it’s unlikely to  break the drought gripping the Midwest.</p>
<p>Along with the deluge of rain expected along the Gulf Coast  when Isaac makes landfall, the National Weather Service predicts 2 to 6  inches of rain will fall in eastern Arkansas, southeast Missouri and  southern Illinois.</p>
</div>
<p>Those areas are among those hard hit by the drought that  stretches from the West Coast east into Kentucky and Ohio, with pockets  in Georgia and Alabama. The rain that falls inland likely will ease but  not eliminate drought, because those areas are so dry, said Mark  Svoboda, a climatologist with the National Drought Mitigation Center.</p>
<p>Arkansas  rancher Don Rodgers said his area is short 17 inches of rain this year.  He said even a couple of inches from Isaac would make a significant  difference because he would have water for his cattle and might be able  to grow some forage for this winter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While I wrote about the higher output temperatures of power plant effluent (water) and the effects on the wild life and the surrounding environment. But the fact is, they have been dropping in production too. I mean if you can&#8217;t cool them, they will melt and for the most part that is a bad thing especially for the nukes. The President of PG&amp;E was crowing about their nuke being cooled by sea water so &#8220;as to be not effected&#8221; by the drought and climate warming. He may want to rethink that.</p>

<h1>Extreme Heat, Drought Show Vulnerability of Nuclear Power Plants</h1>
<h3>Reactor shutdown in Connecticut is latest sign that nuclear energy would face challenges from climate change.</h3>
<div id="authoredBy"><a href="http://insideclimatenews.org/author/robert-krier">By Robert Krier, InsideClimate News</a></div>
<p>Aug 15, 2012</p>
<p>Will 2012 go down as the year that left the idea of nuclear energy expansion in the hot, dry dust?</p>
<p>Nuclear energy might be an important weapon in the battle against climate change, some scientists have argued, because it doesn&#8217;t emit greenhouse gases. But separate of all the other issues with nuclear, that big plus would be moot if the plants couldn&#8217;t operate, or became too inefficient, because of global warming.</p>
<p>In June, <a href="http://insideclimatenews.org/news/20120613/nuclear-power-plants-united-states-climate-change-global-warming-water-scarcity%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">InsideClimate News reported</a> on the findings of Dennis Lettenmaier, a researcher at the University of Washington. His study found that nuclear and other power plants will see a 4 to 16 percent drop in production between 2031 and 2060 due to climate change-induced drought and heat.</p>

Climate Change Comes to the Power Industry</p>
<div>
<p>By Jonathan Marshall</p>
</div>
<p>With temperatures setting <a href="http://capitalclimate.blogspot.com/2012/08/over-100-high-temperature-records-per.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new records</a> across the country, and over half of the continental United States now  experiencing serious drought, global warming is no longer just a  prediction of climate scientists. It’s a reality, here and now.</p>
<p>Though every sector of human activity is feeling the impact, electric  utilities are feeling them especially keenly, as they struggle to keep  up with peak summer demand for air conditioning. At the same time, heat  and drought threaten to curb their ability to generate and transmit  power in the first place.</p>
<p>As Matthew Wald <a href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/17/so-how-hot-was-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> in his Green blog, one power plant in the Midwest was recently  curtailed and another shut down altogether because river water levels  dropped too low for their cooling intake valves. This was no fluke. A  number of Texas power plants <a href="http://www.climateneeds.umd.edu/climatewire-06-08-12/article-18.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduced their output</a> in 2011 due to water shortages. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/24/opinion/will-drought-cause-the-next-blackout.html?ref=opinion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Three years earlier</a>, many more plants throughout the drought-stricken Southeast came close to shutting down.</p>

<p>Go there and read. More tomorrow.</p>
