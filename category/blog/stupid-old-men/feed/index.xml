<p>LACEY TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) — For the second time in as many months, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has fined the owners of a former New Jersey nuclear power plant for security-related violations.</p>
<p>The agency said Wednesday it fined Jupiter, Florida-based Holtec Decommissioning International $50,000 for security violations at the former Oyster Creek nuclear power plant in the Forked River section of Lacey Township.</p>
<p>The plant was one of the oldest in the U.S. when it shut down in 2018.</p>
<p>The fine involved a company employee working as an armorer at the plant.</p>
<p>In an investigation that concluded in March 2021, the NRC determined the armorer “deliberately failed to properly perform required annual material-condition inspections of response unit rifles, and falsified related records.”</p>
<p>The plant has several fortified bunkers from which armed security staff can fight off attackers. The NRC said the violation was the work of “a now-former security superintendent.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nuclear Power was always too EXpensive to meter. But when the Nuclear Choo-Choo Train got going in the 60s everyone was in love with the new technology, the marvelous future, how many decades the plants could run and the massive power produced that the regulators publicly patted the Utility Guys on the back and quietly passed the costs on to ratepayers. This is what should have happened from the very beginning.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/failed-nuclear-contractor-signs-21m-134341356.html">https://news.yahoo.com/failed-nuclear-contractor-signs-21m-134341356.html</a></p>
<h1 data-test-locator="headline">Failed nuclear contractor signs $21M deal, working with feds</h1>
<p>The chief contractor at a failed multibillion-dollar project to build two nuclear reactors in South Carolina has agreed to pay more than $20 million as part of a cooperation agreement with federal authorities probing the fiasco.</p>
<p>Under an agreement announced Monday by Acting U.S. Attorney Rhett DeHart, Westinghouse Electric Co. will contribute $5 million to a program intended to assist low-income ratepayers affected by the project’s failure. Another payment of $16.25 million will be due before July 1, 2022.</p>
<p>The company will also be required to cooperate with federal investigators still probing the company&#8217;s role in the 2017 debacle, which cost ratepayers and investors billions and left nearly 6,000 people jobless.</p>

<p>From the air it looks like a huge lake, fed by many tributaries, but on the ground it turns out to be a murky expanse of water, in which no fish or algae can survive. The shore is coated with a black crust, so thick you can walk on it. Into this huge, 10 sq km tailings pond nearby factories discharge water loaded with chemicals used to process the 17 most sought after minerals in the world, collectively known as <a class="u-underline" title="" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/27/rare-minerals-global-renewables-industry" data-link-name="in body link">rare earths</a>.</p>
<p>The town of <a class="u-underline" title="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baotou" data-link-name="in body link">Baotou</a>, in Inner Mongolia, is the largest Chinese source of these strategic elements, essential to advanced technology, from smartphones to GPS receivers, but also to wind farms and, above all, electric cars. The minerals are mined at Bayan Obo, 120km farther north, then brought to Baotou for processing.</p>
<p>The concentration of rare earths in the ore is very low, so they must be separated and purified, using hydro-metallurgical techniques and acid baths. <a class="u-underline" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">China</a> accounts for 97% of global output of these precious substances, with two-thirds produced in Baotou.</p>
<p>The foul waters of the tailings pond contain all sorts of toxic chemicals, but also radioactive elements such as thorium which, if ingested, cause cancers of the pancreas and lungs, and leukaemia. “Before the factories were built, there were just fields here as far as the eye can see. In the place of this radioactive sludge, there were watermelons, aubergines and tomatoes,” says Li Guirong with a sigh.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald J. Trump is the worst energy President of all time. That takes a lot of doing. Jimmie Carter was real bad on Nuclear Power. George Bush was seriously bad on natural gas and oil. But this alleged policy maker pledged, during the the 2016 campaign, that he would SAVE coal. Under his Presidency the Coal Market has plummeted as has its usage. Even though foreign markets were promised, they have plunged too. Oil futures at one point were trading in negative territory for the first time ever and Nuclear Power Plants are closing. He is opposed to Wind and Solar as they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFHh0Rs34v0">spread across the land</a>. I have a wind turbine within 15 minutes of my house in Riverton and I have a house with total roof solar panels around the corner from me. That says to me that the Cheeto Burito is about to lose office. We shall see.</p>

<p>MARION — Southern Illinois Power Cooperative plans to retire its largest coal-fired generator as early as this fall, a move that is expected to save $125 million over a decade.</p>
</div>
<div class="lee-article-text">
<p>President and CEO Don Gulley said the tentative decision is the result of analysis and negotiations that have been ongoing since late 2019. Gulley said SIPC utilized outside consultants to help it perform a comprehensive review of operations and determine the best path forward. The decision to close Unit 4, as it is known, was based on two primary factors, he said: sustained low energy prices in the wholesale power market, and increasingly costly environmental regulations for coal-fired generators.</p>

<p>In a federal filing Monday permanently documenting its role in causing California’s deadliest wildfire, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric announced it has pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter for the 2018 Camp fire in the Northern California town of Paradise.</p>
<p>PG&amp;E, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said it reached the settlement with the Butte County district attorney’s office on March 17. Under the deal, PG&amp;E said prosecutors won’t pursue further criminal charges, an outcome that disappointed some utility watchdogs.</p>
<p>This is the second time PG&amp;E’s guilt has been established in a wildfire legal proceeding. In 1997, a Nevada County jury <a class="Link" href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/PG-E-Guilty-In-1994-Sierra-Blaze-739-counts-of-2821364.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found the utility guilty of causing a fire</a> three years earlier that burned a dozen homes.</p>
<p>But while this chapter of PG&amp;E’s role in the Camp fire is over, the plea‘s implications for other utilities is less clear, said Shon Hiatt, an associate professor of management and organization at USC’s Marshall School of Business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oil prices are actually at an all time low as supplies are on at an all time high. This article argues however that the oil corporations are so big that they will just diversify as climate change looms larger. In the end they will sell worthless reserves off to unregulated startup oil companies and oil will become like drugs.Those startups will function like drug cartels function today. Selling oil to those addicted to oil. Pretty picture? NO. Our future. Maybe.</p>

For the purposes of our speculative scenarios, everything except for carbon was supposed to be up in the air, and democracy’s track record is mixed.</p>

Combine that with the Chinese state-led investment in clean-energy technology and infrastructure and everyone admired how the world’s largest source of fossil-fuel emissions was going about transition. That’s what the salesperson meant by “outcomes”: decarbonization.</p>

The China expert said the average regional Communist Party official is probably more accountable for his or her performance than the average U.K. member of Parliament, a claim no one in the room full of Brits seemed to find objectionable. The moderator didn’t pose the question to me, the American expert, presumably because our national sense of democratic entitlement is inviolable.</p>

<p><strong>What is This Device?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s called ÖkoWatt and its tech was originally created by no other than the legendary Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist, Nikola Tesla.</p>
<p>Initially it was concealed from the general public because it offered average families the opportunity to save on their monthly energy costs. <a href="http://track.roinattrack.com/click?cep=2iSzLCQN0QDlUE_kc09NvGhBKa4V9Ds1f1yyex-Z58wWB_8RM5YwHXsOKH9NWUtbuCUSEMRKHQ_0RlDGcUpFlJzGXzi4Q_p74VT-SWA2Q0i-Amg8DFsYirLyDONBCYYGMTX9V7TsDuuIZkSVuIL76ySCYwsuwsEUjTcMDlbbd79ETiuYdHHt5oGNQdr1l1eN7JPAsD9viwI-kdqmdTQvkbPd9bdjXInYoegmhpYVBIUXGEESFgLUY8_CvXOPm9Clow1QlJnEaHOjY_GdeJgzp5p53t2mhHj-vj1kxXzkn49xdzLAV9y76nAZJmRS3uV_nv_UPspIgPLK2NkkliRU4r8uXeozX-1H8ZniVXk_djgY91el84Pbh34N5ozleyRYFKReOdCJ-RDKkHh0ExgHan4LjC9L7uL56NKlOIASPj_sC4R9vbQtBfpCO51NEXXA5XZ8yx2ibfxptiiJ9r4pL9Gas3GK5szYiYN8yVYXopT4LgI9MXdJ2xGppP2wnfHhysBeE3FMbR4NJL1HDz8tfQ&amp;lptoken=154f8257813173a793f7&amp;adversion_id=4238759&amp;ad_id=369037&amp;budget_id=206702&amp;adcampaign_id=150894&amp;publication_id=2853&amp;headline_id=1322572&amp;content_id=279679&amp;previewimage_id=333544&amp;device=desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ÖkoWatt is a small, compact, affordable, and easy-to-use plug-in unit</strong></a><strong> </strong>that stops unnecessary power from entering the electrical cables and overloading the network.</p>
<p>ÖkoWatt is your power company&#8217;s worst nightmare. They have been trying to hide ÖkoWatt from the everyday consumer and have even banned it in retail shops.</p>
<p>Big Energy is threatened by this device and its potential to cut into profits.</p>
<p>However, thanks to the Internet, the secret is out, and everyday people are now reaping the rewards of less power consumption overall, <strong><em>as well as that used by household appliances.</em></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Only speculated on several years ago. Feedback Loops are things that speed up or slow down climate change. The two that concern us here are the most obvious, clouds and ice shrinkage. The more water in the atmosphere the more clouds and the hotter the earth &#8211; the more water. But the killer one is, ice is very very reflective. What replaces it it is not and in the case of &#8220;dark&#8221; water, it is incredibly absorptive. The question has always been when would they kick in? I always said we would know when it was too late. Here we are.</p>

<h1 class="full-width-image-lede-text-below__hed">Climate Models Are Running Red Hot, and Scientists Don’t Know Why</h1>
<div class="full-width-image-lede-text-below__dek">
<p>The simulators used to forecast warming have suddenly started giving us less time.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-width-image-lede-text-below__byline">By</div>
<div class="full-width-image-lede-text-below__times"><time class="article-timestamp" datetime="2020-02-03T10:00:14.648Z" data-type="updated" data-status="localized">February 3, 2020, 4:00 AM CST</time></div>
<p class="section-break">There are dozens of climate models, and for decades they’ve agreed on what it would take to heat the planet by about 3° Celsius. It’s an outcome that would be disastrous—flooded cities, agricultural failures, deadly heat—but there’s been a grim steadiness in the consensus among these complicated climate simulations.</p>
<p>Then last year, unnoticed in plain view, some of the models started running very hot. The scientists who hone these systems used the same assumptions about greenhouse-gas emissions as before and came back with far worse outcomes. Some produced projections in excess of 5°C, a nightmare scenario.</p>
<div class="hardwall" data-position="2">
<p>The scientists involved couldn’t agree on why—or if the results should be trusted. Climatologists began “talking to each other like, ‘What’d you get?’, ‘What’d you get?’” said Andrew Gettelman, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, which builds a high-profile climate model.</p>
<p>“The question is whether they’ve overshot,” said Mark Zelinka, staff scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.  Researchers are starting to put together a­nswers, a task that will take months at best, and there’s not yet agreement on how to interpret the hotter results. The reason for worry is that these same models have successfully projected global warming for a half century. Their output continues to frame all major scientific, policy and private-sector climate goals and debates, including the sixth encyclopedic assessment by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change due out next year. If the same amount of climate pollution will bring faster warming than previously thought, humanity would have less time to avoid the worst impacts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I mean how long does it take for people to put an end to this travesty. The response to dry weather and high winds or either is to shut off the power. Where in any other utilities playbook does it say this? California should take over the utility and run it like a public utility. The share holders should take a bath. Maybe a dime on the dollar.</p>

<p data-words="26">About 48,000 Northern California homes and businesses — equating to about 144,000 people — were without power Wednesday in the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/PG-E-outages-900-000-Californians-prepare-for-14846417.php">latest round of PG&amp;E’s precautionary outages.</a></p>
<p data-words="47">The shut-offs affected far fewer people than the ones last month, which at their peak hit close to 3 million Californians. And there’s good news for those weary of blackouts: Rain could arrive in the Bay Area as soon as Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
<p data-words="36">By 5:30 p.m., the utility had given the all-clear to restore power to about 13,000 customers in Shasta, Tehama and Glenn counties, though most of them wouldn’t get their lights back until morning, PG&amp;E officials said.</p>
<p data-words="21">PG&amp;E expected an all-clear for the remaining 35,000 customers around 2 a.m. Thursday. Power restoration would begin at daybreak, officials said.</p>
<p data-words="55">PG&amp;E canceled planned shut-offs for an additional 83,000 homes and businesses — affecting about 249,000 people — as conditions improved, making wildfires less likely. Late Wednesday, the utility decided to preserve power for another 9,400 customers in Butte, Yuba, Plumas and Tehama counties; 14,000 customers in those areas had been told to prepare for outages.</p>

<p>Go there and get outraged over their outages. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a travesty on so many levels. First at the corporate level, who ran this company into the ground? I mean seriously there are all kind of remedies for years, including burying power lines, and cladding power lines or leasing solar on customers roofs. To not do anything but take profit for thirty years should get someone jail time. Second, what about the employees? The Camp Fire was cause my a Power Pole that was ONE HUNDRED years old. Why did someone not take the damn thing down on their own initiative? Again &#8211; Jail Time. Where were the regulators? That should have made them create a revitalization and safety plans 30 years ago. Again &#8211; Jail Time.</p>

<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SAN FRANCISCO &#8211; Large areas of Northern California remained without power on Thursday as a major outage rocked the region for a second day. About 600,000 electricity customers were affected on Thursday morning after the state’s largest utility carried out the second phase of its intentional power cut.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Pacific Gas and Electric said extreme winds overnight forced the additional shutdown, which the utility organized to prevent equipment from sparking fires.</p>
<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The second phase affected bedroom communities in the San Francisco Bay Area and added to the hundreds of thousands of customers who had lost power on Wednesday. As of Thursday morning, the company had restored power to 137,000 customer</p>
