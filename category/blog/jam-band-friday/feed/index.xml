<p>Last Friday, students across 110 countries walked out of their classes in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/19/school-climate-strikes-more-than-1-million-took-part-say-campaigners-greta-thunberg">the massive Youth Climate Strike</a> to bring attention to the effects of climate change. Hundreds of students filled New York’s City Hall Park, the air thrumming with excitement and anxiety. Some even hung from the lamp posts to get  a better view of the swarming crowd before police inevitably invited them to climb down. It was the first protest I’ve been to where children far outnumbered adults.</p>
<p>“I’m here because I don’t want to have to grow up in a world where I am terrified the people I love could lose their home,” Simone Rubin, a senior at NEST+M high school, told <em>The Outline</em>, referencing <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/03/bill-de-blasio-my-new-plan-to-climate-proof-lower-manhattan.html">the potential affect sea level rise</a> could have on <a href="https://www.dec.ny.gov/energy/45202.html">New York City’s coast</a>. “It’s unfair that we’re in this situation now because adults refuse to act and now we’re tasked with cleaning up an earth that we shouldn’t have had to do because we shouldn’t have put ourselves in this situation to begin with.”</p>
<p>The Youth Climate Strike was born out of the #FridaysforFuture demonstrations started by 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. In August 2018, Thunberg started skipping school each Friday to protest outside of the Stockholm Parliament House, calling on leaders to prioritize environmental issues. Thunberg’s notoriety grew as she spoke at the U.N. climate talks last December, and the #FridaysforFuture hashtag received more and more attention. She’s since <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47568227">been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize</a> for her activism.</p>

<h3>Festival of Frugality: Superheroes Are Frugal Too Edition</h3>
<div>Hello and welcome to the 325th edition of the Festival of Frugality. The  Festival of Frugality highlights personal finance posts that deal with <em>how to pinch those pennies or save that dollar</em>.</div>
<p>I am a sucker for a theme for my festivals or carnivals and while I was  tempted to do a leap year facts edition it just wasn&#8217;t exciting enough  for my blood. So superheroes it is. Because what&#8217;s more exciting than  superheroes? It also occurred to me that superheroes are quite frugal  and who hasn&#8217;t sometimes thought that superpowers are needed to stay on  the path of frugality.</p>
<p>Editor&#8217;s Super Picks</p>

<p>It is kind of a return to our old Jam Band Friday format.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Anyway crossing the boundaries between green transportation, energy policy and crowd control, the Germans announced they had come to an agreement to sell Saudia Arabia 200 of their Leopard 2A1 battle main tanks. As Der Speigel quickly pointed out such a sale sends both a crazy signal to Germany&#8217;s large peace community but a defeatist one to those countries involved in the Arab Spring (read: food riots). But when it comes to crushing resistance any battle main usually weighs over 50 ton, so that works out pretty well. Do not be fooled either by the nameless chinese man&#8217;s dance with the Chinese battle main because that was a once in a century event. The Arab drivers prefer to get them  babies up to their top speeds of 45 miles per hour and roll. At those speeds they get a whopping 1.3333 miles per gallon. But at more cautious battle speeds they get something more like 4 &#8211; 5 miles per gallon. Kinda like a 1963 red corvette. Or maybe a Hummer. But when you compare it to its actual soul mates like the Caterpillar 797 which gets a heart pumping 3 miles per gallon at the same speeds the Leopard is a true jungle cat. OK well I have had enough fun for today.</p>

<h1>Should Germany Sell Tanks to Saudi Arabia?</h1>

<p>Troops of the 37th Armored Infantry Brigade (37. Panzergrenadierbrigade) prepare to board their Marder light tanks.</p>
</div>
<div>It&#8217;s never easy to balance idealism with political realities,  but as Germany grapples with the challenges posed by the Arab Spring it  is sometimes hard to tell which side</div>
<div>Berlin is on.</div>
</div>
<p>The capital&#8217;s latest foreign-policy faux pas is an alleged  behind-closed-doors deal to sell state-of-the-art tanks to Saudi Arabia.  The deal — so secret the government won&#8217;t even acknowledge it was ever  discussed — has kicked up a firestorm of protest, uniting an unlikely  coalition of leftist politicians, human-rights groups, church leaders  and senior members of Chancellor Angela Merkel&#8217;s own Christian  Democratic Union (CDU) party. <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1977010,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(See &#8220;Angela Merkel: German Rules.&#8221;)</a></p>
<p>News of the deal broke on Sunday, when the newsweekly <em>Der Spiegel</em> reported that Germany&#8217;s ultra-secretive Federal Security Council, whose  members include Merkel, Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, and Defense  Minister Thomas De Maiziere, approved the sale of 200 Leopard 2 tanks,  Germany&#8217;s most modern battlefield tank, to Saudi Arabia. During a  meeting of the CDU parliamentary group on Monday, Norbert Lammert, the  president of the Bundestag — the German parliament — and Ruprecht  Polenz, head of parliament&#8217;s influential foreign affairs committee,  argued forcefully that Germany could not sell such heavy arms to a  country known for routine violations of the most basic human rights.  &#8220;Such decisions cannot be taken at a time when people are fighting for  democracy in the Arab world,&#8221; said Juergen Trittin, a Green Party  leader, on German television on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Protests have also been raining in from church leaders and human-rights  activists, who argue that Saudi Arabia is on the wrong side of history  in the tide of rebellion sweeping through the Arab world. As the  momentum of protests in Tunisia and Egypt carried the Arab Spring into  the tiny nation of Bahrain last March, some 2,000 troops from Arab  nations close to the ruling monarchy, including heavily armed Saudis,  quashed the rebellion. Meanwhile, the German government still faces  criticism for abstaining from the U.N. Security Council vote authorizing  air strikes in support of Libyan rebels, and still refuses to offer  direct military aid, even after softening its position (it does provide  about $5.3 million in financial assistance for NATO&#8217;s Libya mission.)  Against that backdrop, even Merkel&#8217;s closest party allies are at a loss  to justify the sale of weapons to a nation with a history of oppression.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2029774_2029776_2031839,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(See where Angela Merkel falls on the most powerful women list.)</a></p>
<p>The deal, were it to take place, is stunning not only because of the  political signal it sends to pro-democracy activists in the Middle East  and North Africa. A weapons sale of that order would mark a significant  change in German arms-export policies. For the past 20 years, Germany  has refused to sell such heavy artillery to the Saudis, citing concerns  over human-rights abuses. German law also forbids weapons exports to  countries engaged in a direct conflict — though the definition of  conflict is open to interpretation.</p>
<div>dot dot dot (as they say)&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2081566,00.html#ixzz1RXV42xaI"></a></p>
</div>
<p>The Leopard 2 tank is manufactured in Germany but is also produced under  license in Spain. And the Saudis are believed to have also negotiated with the Spanish,  putting Madrid and Berlin in competition for defense jobs. Germany has a  small army and with the end of the Cold War there is little requirement  for tanks like the Leopard 2 on potential European battlefields. NATO  is scaling back its traditional European land defenses in favor of  lighter, rapid deployment forces to support campaigns out of the  European theater, such as Afghanistan. The shrinking demand at home  leaves defense companies looking abroad for contracts.</p>

<p>The <strong>Leopard 2E</strong> (<em>E</em> stands for <em>España</em>, <a title="Spanish language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language">Spanish</a> for Spain) is a variant of the German <a title="Leopard 2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard_2">Leopard 2</a> <a title="Main battle tank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_battle_tank">main battle tank</a>, tailored to the requirements of the <a title="Spanish Army" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Army">Spanish Army</a>, which acquired it as part of an armament modernization program named <em><a title="Programa Coraza (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Programa_Coraza&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Programa Coraza</a></em>, or Program Armor. The acquisition program for the Leopard 2E began in 1994, five years after the cancellation of the <a title="Lince (tank)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lince_%28tank%29">Lince</a> tank program that culminated in an agreement to transfer 108 <a title="Leopard 2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard_2#Leopard_2A4">Leopard 2A4s</a> to the Spanish Army in 1998 and started the local production of the  Leopard 2E in December 2003. Despite postponement of production due to  the 2003 merger between Santa Bárbara Sistemas and <a title="General Dynamics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics">General Dynamics</a> and continued fabrication issues between 2006 and 2007, 219 Leopard 2Es have been delivered to the Spanish Army.</p>
<p>The Leopard 2E is a major improvement over the <a title="M60 Patton" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M60_Patton">M60 Patton</a> tank, which it replaced in Spain&#8217;s mechanized and armored units. Its  development represented a total of 2.6 million hours worth of work,  9,600 of them in Germany, at a total cost of 1.9 billion <a title="Euros" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euros">euros</a>.  This makes it one of the most expensive Leopard 2s built. Indigenous  production amounted to 60% and the vehicles were assembled locally at <a title="Sevilla" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla">Sevilla</a> by Santa Bárbara Sistemas.

<p>Conventional post election wisdom has the Cap and Trade legislation being declared dead. But, it is sitting in a Senate that the Democrats control. Will they bust it lose during the end of the year session. Who knows, but I think the issue will not go away so sooner or later something will have to be done. I mean Russia caught on fire. How much more does it take than that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/nov/4/clean-coal-is-as-dead-as-cap-and-trade/" target="_self" rel="noopener">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/nov/4/clean-coal-is-as-dead-as-cap-and-trade/</a></p>
<h1>MILLOY: Clean coal is as dead as &#8216;cap-and-trade&#8217;</h1>
<h2>Mitch McConnell had better study up on the election results</h2>
<p>By Steve Milloy-The Washington Times</p>
<p>While we shouldn&#8217;t expect our left-wing elitist president to  understand Tuesday&#8217;s electoral rejection of his &#8220;progressive&#8221;  prescriptions for America, we should expect Senate Minority Leader Mitch  McConnell, Kentucky Republican, to get it.</p>
<p>But Mr. McConnell  seems to have missed the message, at least when it comes to  &#8220;cap-and-trade&#8221; &#8211; odd for a coal-state politician. The day after the  election, Mr. McConnell said, &#8220;The president says he&#8217;s for nuclear  power. Most of my members are for nuclear power. The president says he&#8217;s  for clean coal technology. Most of my members are for clean coal  technology. There are areas that we can make progress on for the  country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aside from the canard of President Obama sincerely  supporting nuclear power and the fact that Republicans ought to avoid  the loaded and already co-opted-by-the-left word &#8220;progress,&#8221; so-called  &#8220;clean coal&#8221; is a form of Obama-think &#8211; a discredited cap-and-trade  concept that was more trap than sincere policy.</p>
<p>Some in the coal  industry and some coal-burning electric utilities had been talked into  supporting cap-and-trade, provided that taxpayers and ratepayers forked  over billions (if not trillions) of dollars for so-called &#8220;carbon  capture and sequestration&#8221; (CCS) &#8211; that is, burying utility  carbon-dioxide emissions deep underground and hoping they stay there  safely.</p>
<p>But to the extent that any so-called environmentalists  paid any lip service to clean coal and CCS, it was only to lure coal and  utility suckers into cap-and-trade. Does anyone really believe, after  all, that the greens would allow utilities to inject underground  billions of tons of highly pressurized carbon dioxide all over the  nation? They fought tooth-and-nail, after all, to prevent the storage of  sealed casks of spent nuclear fuel one mile underground in the Nevada  desert.</p>

<p>Which would they prefer, a tax on carbon? This guys lists all the reasons for cap and trade mechanisms to be set up by the Federal Government and heavily policed by the Federal Government. Nonetheless he likes carbon taxes because they supply more stability. But his belief that it won&#8217;t be passed on to the customer is asinine.</p>

<h2>Cap and Trade Legislation is Fatally Flawed</h2>
<h3>My First Ever Mea Culpa</h3>
<p><strong>By Nick Hodge</strong><br />

<p>We may never see cap and trade in this country.</p>
<p>Those are words I never thought I&#8217;d write.</p>
<p>In fact, I&#8217;ve been touting the benefits of a cap and trade market  since 2007.  But new ideas, unraveling facts, and recent events have  changed my thinking.</p>

<h3>My First Ever Mea Culpa</h3>
<p><strong>By Nick Hodge</strong><br />
<em>Tuesday, April 13th, 2010</em></p>
<p>We may never see cap and trade in this country.</p>
<p>Those are words I never thought I&#8217;d write.</p>
<p>In fact, I&#8217;ve been touting the benefits of a cap and trade market  since 2007.  But new ideas, unraveling facts, and recent events have  changed my thinking.</p>
<p>So today, I&#8217;m publishing my first ever mea culpa.</p>
<div>
<hr size="1" /></div>
<p><strong>Carbon Should Still be Priced</strong></p>
<p>To be clear, I&#8217;m not saying that carbon shouldn&#8217;t have a price.  By all means, it should.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m saying is that cap and trade isn&#8217;t the way to implement it.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, carbon dioxide is a harmful waste product that  needs to be handled. Companies don&#8217;t get free passes for treating and  disposing of other waste streams their businesses generate. Why should  carbon be any different?</p>
<p>Not charging companies for emitting carbon is giving them free reign  over something they cannot and will not ever own: the atmosphere.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t let companies freely dump waste into rivers or lakes&#8230; We  don&#8217;t allow companies to dump waste in forests&#8230; So why, then, are we  still letting companies dump a known pollutant into the atmosphere  unchecked?</p>
<p>This is why everyone speaks of how cheap coal is. It&#8217;s not really  that cheap, we just don&#8217;t include the price of carbon in its costs.</p>
<p>Carbon isn&#8217;t a business externality — meaning, companies that produce  it can shift the cost to society — and it can no longer be treated as  such.</p>
<p><strong>The Trouble with Cap and Trade</strong></p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>You can go to the article for the rest. I personally support a carbon tax. But I have always said that Cap and Trade is what we get because high finance wants it that way. More Monday.</p>

<p>This appears to say it all:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/10/15/hungary.sludge.ceo/" target="_self" rel="noopener">http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/10/15/hungary.sludge.ceo/</a></p>
<h1>CEO doesn&#8217;t &#8216;feel&#8217; responsible in Hungary spill, but will aid efforts</h1>
<div>
<div>By  <strong>the CNN Wires Staff</strong></div>
<div>October 15, 2010 10:55 a.m. EDT</div>
</div>
<p><strong>(CNN)</strong> &#8212; The CEO of the Hungarian company behind a huge toxic  spill on Thursday said he doesn&#8217;t know whether he&#8217;s responsible for the  disaster, but added, &#8220;I have moral duties and I will fulfill them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoltan  Bakonyi, the chief executive of the MAL aluminum plant, spoke with  CNN&#8217;s Diana Magnay a day after he was released from jail pending trial.  Bakonyi was detained on Monday, accused of public endangerment and  harming the environment.</p>
<p>:} <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBc9B8JXCP0&amp;feature=channel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBc9B8JXCP0&amp;feature=channel</a> :}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s said I should be responsible  although I don&#8217;t feel it,&#8221; Bakonyi told Magnay. He insisted that MAL was  in compliance with all Hungarian safety regulations and pointed out  that he has only been CEO for two years. Bakonyi argued that the  problems presented by the reservoir and the accumulation of toxin in it  stretched back 25 years or more.</p>
<p>But he added that it is his &#8220;moral duty&#8221; is to &#8220;help&#8221; and put his energies &#8220;120-percent into the aid effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bakonyi  categorically denied that a hole was present in the reservoir in the  days or weeks before the spill happened. Bakonyi said he had visited the  reservoir in the weeks before the spill happened. But, he said he  hadn&#8217;t seen the photo released by the The World Wildlife Fund showing  one of the pools of sludge &#8212; a byproduct of the process to turn bauxite  ore into aluminium oxide &#8212; leaking into a nearby field. The WWF says  the photo was taken in June.</p>
<p>Bakonyi also denied the spill was a  consequence of overproduction or improper payment of workers. He  maintained that there was no way to anticipate the accident. &#8220;The only  way anyone could have imagine this happening,&#8221; he said, &#8220;was in a  terrorist attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>MAL has &#8220;an idea&#8221; about how the spill  occurred, but Bakonyi won&#8217;t comment on what it is. He says no statement  on causes will be released until Hungarian authorities complete their  own investigation.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>He may have an idea??? More next week.</p>

<p>BP&#8217;s Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico served as a  wake-up call for many of us who never before paid attention to the  destructive energy projects happening all around the world. But while  Deepwater Horizon may have attracted the lion&#8217;s share of media attention  this past Spring and Summer, there are a number of other toxic projects  still going on. Below, we look at some of the worst.</p>

<p><strong>Alberta Tar Sands</strong></p>
<p>Alberta,  Canada is home to the second biggest recoverable oil reserve in the  world: the infamous Athabasca tar sands. But the massive deposit of  heavy crude oil (aka bitumen) is under a staggering 54,000 square miles  of boreal forest and peat bogs, which are slowly being destroyed by the  open pit mining used to recover Alberta&#8217;s oil. These open pit mining  projects also deposit toxic mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and lead into the  Athabasca river system, creating &#8220;<a href="http://www.next100.com/2010/08/getting-stuck-in-the-tar-sands.php?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+next100blog+%28NEXT100%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">masses of toxic soup</a>.&#8221; Suncor Energy, Syncrude Canada, Shell Canada, Marathon Oil, and Chevron are all pursuing projects in the Athabasca sands.</p>

<p><strong>Three Gorges Dam</strong></p>
<p>China&#8217;s Three Gorges Dam, a hydroelectric dam in the Yangtze river,  is world&#8217;s largest electricity-generating plant. Completed in 2006, the  dam has already produced 348.4 TWh of electricity since its inception.  But the Dam has its drawbacks&#8211;construction displaced 1.2 million people  (not the only Chinese water project to <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1686239/china-water-crisis-south-north-water-transfer-project-three-gorges-dam">displace huge populations</a>), increased the risk of landslides in the area, and made nearby Shanghai significantly more vulnerable to flooding.</p>

(John Moore / Getty Images) 									 									As the EPA and BP fight over the Gulf oil spill cleanup,  the Daily Beast crunches the numbers and ranks the most contaminated  sites in the nation.</strong></p>
<p>The BP oil rig explosion has led to untold millions in lost income  for people who make their living from the Gulf, but toxic hazards are an  everyday occurrence: The EPA estimates that there are 3,500 chemical  spills each year, requiring $260 million to clean.</p>
<p>Above those, however, are the Superfund sites—places that have  sustained major, long-term damage, necessitating years of cleanup.  Established in 1980 after a series of toxic disasters, including the  infamous Love Canal district of Niagara Falls, which turned the  neighborhood into a virtual ghost town, Superfund has largely succeeded  in centralizing hazardous waste cleanup and holding responsible parties  financially accountable.</p>
<p>The BP fiasco—both a natural and human disaster—got us thinking: what  are today’s most polluted toxic dumping grounds? To figure it out, we  examined all available Superfund data from the Environmental Protection  Agency. We filtered the results, focusing on sites that remain dangerous  for human exposure and sites that have dangerous ground water. And then  we ranked them using the following criteria:</p>
<p><strong>·     Toxicity per acre</strong>: The  number of instances of each toxin, multiplied by the severity of each  toxin, according to the Agency for Toxic Substances &amp; Disease  Registry, and divided by the acreage of the site.</p>
<p><strong>·     Toxicity per population</strong>: To  determine potential human exposure we took the number of instances of  each toxin, multiplied by the severity of each toxin, and divided by the  population within one mile of the site. (The EPA gives a population  range, and we used the higher number for this calculation.)</p>
<p>Since toxicity per acre is a more concrete statistic than potential  human exposure (one can live near a toxic site and avoid contact), we  weighted the former three times the impact of the latter. An important  note: The human exposure element does not measure exposure levels, but  rather indicates that the EPA believes there is a reasonable expectation  that people may be exposed to contamination—exactly what the Superfund  teams spend their time trying to alleviate.</p>

<p><strong>History: </strong>From 1949 to 1991 Fletcher&#8217;s Paint Works operated a  retail store and storage facility in this small New Hampshire town along  the Souhegan River. In 1982 New Hampshire officials found leaking and  open drums of paint chemicals in the storage area. Soil and groundwater  around the site was later found contaminated with arsenic, lead, PCBs,  and a slew of other nasty chemicals. The nearby Keyes Municipal Water  Supply Well was shut down in the early 1980s after it was found  contaminated by volatile organic compounds—gases emitted from paint and  other household supplies. Cleanup began in 1988 and continues today. The  EPA has tested homes in the area for gases seeping from soil into  basements, with no health risks found in the homes and another round of  testing due for June 2010. The main concern now is that fish in the  Souhegan contain PCBs, and that the EPA has found evidence of people  fishing in the river.</p>

<strong>Toxic chemicals: </strong>59</p>
<p><strong>History:</strong> Getting rid of toxic waste used to be so simple.  National Wood Preservers, which treated wood on the site from 1947 to  1963, would take their liquid waste lined with pentachlorophenols (PCPs)  to a well, and dump it down. Or they would toss the PCP-laden liquid  onto the ground. A nearby stream was contaminated, though residents  living within a mile of the site don&#8217;t use it for drinking water. In  1992 the EPA removed 97,000 tons of liquid waste, and 60 tons of sludge  from the site. The EPA is armed with $4.2 million from the Recovery Act  to finish the final cleanup phase, which includes removing contaminated  soil from residential property and public spaces.</p>

<p>So here is the governments thought for you renters out there.</p>

<h1>Top 10 Tips for Renters!</h1>
</div>
<div id="mid_col">
<p>Even if you rent an apartment, townhouse, or a home, you can make a  big difference, too!  These tips will show you how to be more energy  efficient and save energy, money, and reduce the risks of global  warming.  If there are things you can&#8217;t change on your own, share these  tips and encourage your landlord to help you make a change for the  better.</p>
<ol>
<li>Lighting is one of the easiest places to start saving energy.  Replacing your five most frequently used light fixtures or the bulbs in  them with ENERGY STAR qualified lights can save more than $65 a year in  energy costs. ENERGY STAR qualified compact fluorescent light bulbs  (CFLs) provide high-quality light output, use 75% less energy, and last  6–10 times longer than standard incandescent light bulbs, saving money  on energy bills and replacement costs.
<ul>
<li>Remember to always turn off your lights when leaving a room.  Turning off just one 60-watt incandescent bulb that would otherwise burn  eight hours a day can save about $15 per year!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Considering purchasing a room air conditioner? Consider an ENERGY  STAR qualified model. They use at least 10 percent less energy than  standard models.
<ul>
<li>In the winter, be sure to insulate room air conditioners from  the outside with a tight-fitting a/c unit cover, available at your local  home improvement center or hardware store. This keeps heated air from  escaping outside. Alternately, you can remove the window unit in the  winter months to prevent energy losses.</li>
<li>Be sure the window unit fits tightly in the window so outdoor air is not getting in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If possible, install a programmable thermostat to automatically  adjust your home&#8217;s temperature settings when you&#8217;re away or sleeping.
<ul>
<li>When used properly, a programmable thermostat with its four  temperature settings can save up to $150 a year in energy costs. Proper  use means setting the thermostat at energy-saving temperatures without  overriding that setting. You should also set the &#8220;hold&#8221; button at a  constant energy-saving temperature when you&#8217;re away or on vacation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consumer electronics play an increasingly larger role in your  home&#8217;s energy consumption, accounting for 15 percent of household  electricity use. Many consumer electronics products use energy even when  switched off. Electronics equipment that has earned the ENERGY STAR  helps save energy when off, while maintaining features like clock  displays, channel settings, and remote-control functions.
<ul>
<li>Unplug any battery chargers or power adapters when not in use (like your cell phone charger!).</li>
<li>Use a power strip as a central “turn off” point when you are done using equipment.
<ul>
<li>Even when turned off, electronic and IT equipment often use a  small amount of electricity. For home office equipment, this stand-by or  “phantom” power load can range from a few watts to as much as 20 or  even 40 watts for each piece of equipment. Using a power strip for your  computer and all peripheral equipment allows you to completely  disconnect the power supply from the power source, eliminating standby  power consumption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A ten minute shower can use less water than a full bath.
<ul>
<li>With a new 2.5 gallon-per-minute (low-flow) shower head, a  10-minute shower will use about 25 gallons of water, saving you five  gallons of water over a typical bath. A new showerhead also will save  energy — up to $145 each year on electricity — beating out both the bath  and an old-fashioned showerhead.</li>
<li>To avoid moisture problems, control humidity in your bathroom by  running your ventilating fan during and 15 minutes after showers and  baths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure all air registers are clear of furniture so that air can  circulate freely. If your home has radiators, place heat-resistant  reflectors between radiators and walls. In the winter, this will help  heat the room instead of the wall.</li>
<li>During cold weather, take advantage of the sun&#8217;s warmth by keeping  drapes open during daylight hours. To keep out the heat of the summer  sun, close window shades and drapes in warm weather.</li>
<li>Save water by scraping dishes instead of rinsing them before  loading in the dishwasher. Run your dishwasher with a full load and use  the air-dry option if available.
<ul>
<li>Rinsing dirty dishes before loading your dishwasher uses a lot  of water and energy. Most dishwashers today can thoroughly clean dishes  that have had food scraped, rather than rinsed, off — the wash cycle and  detergent take care of the rest. To make the most efficient use of your  dishwasher&#8217;s energy and water consumption, run the dishwasher only when  enough dirty dishes have accumulated for a full load.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wash your laundry with cold water whenever possible. To save  water, try to wash full loads or, if you must wash a partial load,  reduce the level of water appropriately.
<ul>
<li>Hot water heating accounts for about 90 percent of the energy  your machine uses to wash clothes — only 10 percent goes to electricity  used by the washer motor. Depending on the clothes and local water  quality (hardness), many homeowners can effectively do laundry  exclusively with cold water, using cold water laundry detergents.  Switching to cold water can save the average household more than $40  annually (with an electric water heater) and more than $30 annually  (with a gas water heater).</li>
<li>Washing full loads can save you more than 3,400 gallons of water each year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t over dry your clothes. If your dryer has a moisture sensor  that will automatically turn the machine off when clothes are done, use  it to avoid over drying. Remember to clean the lint trap before every  load. Dry full loads, or reduce drying time for partial loads. Learn  more.
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s easy to over dry your clothes, if one setting is used for  various fabric types. Try to dry loads made up of similar fabrics, so  the entire load dries just as the cycle ends. Many dryers come with  energy-saving moisture or humidity sensors that shut off the heat when  the clothes are dry. If you don&#8217;t have this feature, try to match the  cycle length to the size and weight of the load. A dryer operating an  extra 15 minutes per load can cost you up to $34, every year.</li>
<li>The lint trap is an important energy saver. Dryers work by  moving heated air through wet clothes, evaporating and then venting  water vapor outside. If the dryer cannot provide enough heat, or move  air sufficiently through the clothes, they will take longer to dry, and  may not dry at all. One of the easiest things you can do to increase  drying efficiency is to clean the lint trap before each and every load.  This step also can save you up to $34 each year.</li>

<h1>Apartments</h1>
<p>Simple energy conservation measures can lower your utility bills  while increasing the comfort of your apartment. Although your landlord  or management company is ultimately responsible for your building&#8217;s  energy efficiency, you make dozens of energy decisions every day.</p>
<h2>Electricity</h2>
<p>Many ways for cutting electricity costs in houses also apply to apartments. See our section on <a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/electricity/index.cfm/mytopic=11140">reducing electricity use</a> for ways to lower these costs.</p>
<h2>Heating and Cooling</h2>
<p>Here  are some ways to reduce your heating and cooling costs. They can also  make your apartment more comfortable. You might need your landlord&#8217;s or  management company&#8217;s permission for some of the suggestions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/insulation_airsealing/index.cfm/mytopic=11270">Caulk</a> and <a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/insulation_airsealing/index.cfm/mytopic=11280">weatherstrip</a> windows and exterior doors.</li>
<li>Carefully select, install, and use <a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/windows_doors_skylights/index.cfm/mytopic=13500">window treatments or coverings</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Water Heating</h2>
<p>If you have your own water heater in your apartment, see our section on <a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=13030">energy-efficient water heating</a>. If you don&#8217;t have your own water heater, you can still save energy by <a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=13050">reducing your hot water use</a>. You may need your landlord&#8217;s or management company&#8217;s permission for some of these energy conservation measures.</p>

<p>Energy Conservation and Energy Efficiency are two sides of the same coin.  Most people think they mean the same thing, but they don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Energy conservation means reducing the level of energy use by turning down a thermostat, or turning off a light, or turning up the temperature of your refrigerator.</p>
<p>Energy efficiency means getting the same job done while using less energy.  Efficiency is usually done by replacing an older, less efficient appliance with a new one.</p>
<p>In this section, you&#8217;ll find both energy conservation and efficiency tips for your home, office, school, car or truck, and other areas.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll learn how to get your home ready for summer or winter.   You&#8217;ll learn how to be prepared in case the power goes out. And you&#8217;ll learn some interesting facts about energy.</p>
