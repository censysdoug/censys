<h1>Coal, nuclear plant operator files for bankruptcy, asks Trump for a bailout</h1>
<h2>FirstEnergy&#8217;s request comes after regulator struck down an industry-wide bailout plan.</h2>

<p>On Saturday, power corporation FirstEnergy placed its coal and nuclear generation units <a href="https://cms.arstechnica.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=226681&amp;action=edit">under chapter 11 bankruptcy</a>. Although coal and nuclear plants across the country have struggled to compete with the low prices of natural gas, FirstEnergy&#8217;s filing is unique because it stands to take on a political dimension. Just two days before FirstEnergy&#8217;s bankruptcy filing, the company petitioned the Department of Energy (DOE) for an emergency bailout, <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/firstenergy-asks-doe-for-emergency-action-to-save-pjm-coal-nuke-plants/520280/">citing concerns about reliability</a>.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p>The petition could reinvigorate a debate started by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/energy-secretary-proposes-rule-to-make-grid-managers-favor-coal-nuclear/">proposed a rule</a> last year to change how coal and nuclear plants are compensated for their power. The rule was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/federal-regulator-denies-rick-perrys-proposal-to-compensate-coal-nuclear/">denied by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> (FERC), which said that there was not enough evidence to justify changing how coal and nuclear are compensated.</p>
<p>FirstEnergy disparaged FERC&#8217;s decision in <a href="https://statepowerproject.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/fes-202c-application.pdf">its Thursday petition</a> (PDF), claiming that &#8220;as a result of FERC’s and the RTO&#8217;s [Regional Transmission Organization&#8217;s] failure to address this crisis, swift and decisive action is needed <em>now</em> to address this imminent loss of nuclear and coal-fired baseload generation and the threat to the electric grid that this loss poses&#8221; (emphasis FirstEnergy&#8217;s).</p>

<h2>Temperature Increase</h2>
<div class="g-fulltext">“Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to <strong>pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C</strong> above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.”</div>
<div class="g-comments">
<div class="g-comment">
<div class="g-credit">Justin Gillis, climate science reporter:</div>
<div class="g-commentary">This agreement adopts a more ambitious target for limiting global warming than in the past by mentioning 1.5 degrees Celsius as part of the concrete goal to stay well below 2 degrees. If that were to be actually achieved, it would likely ward off some of the most severe effects of climate change. For example, although we don’t know the exact temperature, there is a trigger point at which the whole Greenland ice sheet and the West Antarctic ice sheet will melt. There is a chance that staying below 2 degrees Celsius would avoid that trigger point, and an even better chance if we stay below 1.5 degrees.</div>

<h2>Preservation of Forests</h2>
<div class="g-fulltext">“Parties are encouraged to take action to implement and support, including through results-based payments, the existing framework as set out in related guidance and decisions already agreed under the Convention for: policy approaches and positive incentives for activities relating to <strong>reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests</strong> and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries; and alternative policy approaches, such as joint mitigation and adaptation approaches for the integral and sustainable management of forests, while reaffirming the importance of incentivizing, as appropriate, non-carbon benefits associated with such approaches.”</div>

<p>Answering a plea from Pope Francis to protect the planet, Chicagoans — Catholics and non-Catholics alike — pledged Thursday to collect rainfall, conserve tap water, recycle their cans and bottles, and switch off the lights when they leave a room.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an unusually tangible, immediate and ecumenical response to a papal encyclical, a letter expounding on Catholic teachings.</p>
<p>But the encyclical itself is an extraordinary letter. Francis&#8217; first solo encyclical (he co-wrote one with his predecessor) is the first time the leader of the world&#8217;s billion Roman Catholics has addressed the environment. And the letter is more than a manifesto for clergy and bishops to use as a teaching tool. It&#8217;s a call to action with scientific rationale, written in plain language and addressed to &#8220;every person living on this planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so excited about the courage of this pope. He&#8217;s done his homework,&#8221; said Gina Orlando, an instructor of science and spirituality courses at DePaul University and a Catholic who recently returned to Ascension Catholic Church in Oak Park after spending the last several years church shopping. &#8220;I&#8217;m back now because of this encyclical and the possibility that it holds for spirituality and environmental change.&#8221;</p>

<p id="story-continues-1" class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="341" data-total-count="341">VATICAN CITY — <a class="meta-per" title="More articles about Pope Francis." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/f/francis_i/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Pope Francis</a> on Thursday called for a radical transformation of politics, economics and individual lifestyles to confront environmental degradation and <a class="meta-classifier" title="Recent and archival news about global warming." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">climate change</a>, as his much-awaited papal encyclical blended a biting critique of consumerism and irresponsible development with a plea for swift and unified global action.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="409" data-total-count="750">The vision that Francis outlined in the 184-page encyclical is sweeping in ambition and scope: He described a relentless exploitation and destruction of the environment, for which he blamed apathy, the reckless pursuit of profits, excessive faith in technology and political shortsightedness. The most vulnerable victims are the world’s poorest people, he declared, who are being dislocated and disregarded.</p>
<p>The first pope from the developing world, Francis, an Argentine, used the encyclical — titled “Laudato Si’,” or “Praise Be to You” — to highlight the crisis posed by climate change. He placed most of the blame on fossil fuels and human activity while warning of an “unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequence for all of us” if swift action is not taken. Developed, industrialized countries were mostly responsible, he said, and were obligated to help poorer nations confront the crisis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The insurgents who attacked the Algerian Natural Gas Plant have claimed victory but they were total failures. I am sorry that 40 people or less are dead. For the innocents anyway. Workers really just doing their jobs. But as far as I can see all of the attackers got wacked too. Ultimately I think their plan was to damage the plant and run off with the hostages and neither one of those things happened.  They probably lost many good weapons, many good explosive and many trained fighters. This was a dumb operation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/algeria/9816767/BP-Algeria-gas-plant-raid-co-ordinated-by-a-Canadian.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/algeria/9816767/BP-Algeria-gas-plant-raid-co-ordinated-by-a-Canadian.htm</a>l</p>
<h1>BP Algeria gas plant raid &#8216;co-ordinated&#8217; by a Canadian</h1>
<h2>The BP gas plant raid was &#8220;co-ordinated&#8221; by a Canadian terrorist and claimed the lives of at least 37 foreign hostages, the Algerian prime minister announced on Monday.</h2>
<div>
<p>Abdelmalek Sellal told a press conference in Algiers that a further five foreigners remained unaccounted for in the wake of the siege which ended when Algerian special forces stormed the remote Saharan plant on Saturday.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>A total of 29 terrorists were also killed, with three others captured alive, he said.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Mr Sellal said the plot had been hatched in Mali and that the attackers had travelled through Niger and Libya before slipping into Algeria. He said that one of the hostage takers was believed to have been Canadian &#8220;judging by his English accent&#8221;. &#8220;He was co-ordinating the attack,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The more things change the more they stay the same. This Blog for instance will change at the beginning of the year. I am going to seek full time employment after working on Community Energy Systems for 6 years. I do not really know what that means. It could mean as little as 1 post a week. In an emergency like Katrina or the Gulf Oil Spew it could mean daily for awhile. Today I leave you with something I have seen up close and personal, the ancient Bristle Cone Pine tree.</p>

<p>By Hunter Oatman-Stanford</p>
<p>n 1964, a geologist in the Nevada wilderness discovered the oldest living thing on earth, after he killed it. The young man was Donald Rusk Currey, a graduate student studying ice-age glaciology in Eastern Nevada; the tree he cut down was of the<em> Pinus longaeva</em>species, also known as the Great Basin bristlecone pine. Working on a grant from the National Science Foundation, Currey was compiling the ages of ancient bristlecone trees to develop a glacial timeline for the region.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Bristlecones are slow-growing and conservative, not the grow-fast, die-young types.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Currey’s ring count for this particular tree reached backward from the present, past the founding of the United States, the Great Crusades, and even the Greek and Roman Empires, to the time of the ancient Egyptians. Sheltered in an unremarkable grove near Wheeler Peak, the bristlecone he cut down was found to be nearly 5,000 years old, taking root only a few hundred years after human history was first recorded. How could a half-dead pine barely 20 feet tall outdo the skyscraper-height sequoias, commonly thought to be the oldest trees alive?</p>
<p>The longevity of Great Basin bristlecones was first recognized in the 1950s by Dr. Edward Schulman, who shocked a scientific community that believed in a correlation between long lifespan and great size. Schulman systematically sampled Great Basin bristlecones in California and Nevada, and published his findings in a 1958 <em>National Geographic </em>article, which revealed several of the trees to be more than 4,000 years old. Schulman’s analysis supported the idea that “adversity begets longevity,” or that the severe conditions in which the bristlecone pine evolved actually helped extend its lifespan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am 57 years old and it may all be down hill from here. Seriously. In humankind&#8217;s 100,000 year history we just threw a spear out of here. In terms of what we were promised &#8211; you know warp drive, aliens and foreign civilizations it is kind of drab; but in terms of goal posts, it is a huge leap. Some might even say a quantum leap. All I can say is WOW.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.chron.com/sciguy/2012/10/more-evidence-that-voyager-has-exited-the-solar-system/">http://blog.chron.com/sciguy/2012/10/more-evidence-that-voyager-has-exited-the-solar-system/</a></p>
<h1>More evidence that Voyager has exited the solar system</h1>
<div>Friday, October 5, 2012</div>
<p>A science blog with Eric Berger</p>
<p>Something very, very interesting is happening with <strong><a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_top" rel="noopener">Voyager 1</a></strong>, the human probe that’s the very farthest from Earth.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://voyager.gsfc.nasa.gov/heliopause/heliopause/recenthist.html" target="_top" rel="noopener">New data</a></strong> from the spacecraft, which I will discuss below, indicate Voyager 1 may have exited the solar system for good. If true, this would mark a truly historic moment for the human race — sending a spacecraft beyond the edge of our home solar system.</p>
<p>At last check, NASA scientists said they <strong><a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/news/signs_changing_fast.html" target="_top" rel="noopener">were not yet ready</a></strong> to officially declare that Voyager 1 had officially exited the solar system by crossing the <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliosphere" target="_top" rel="noopener">heliopause</a></strong>.</p>
<p>To cross this boundary scientists say they would need to observe three things:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>An increase in high-energy cosmic rays originating from outside our solar system</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> A drop in charged particles emanating from the sun.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>A change in the direction of the magnetic field.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.chron.com/sciguy/2012/06/voyager-1-may-have-officially-exited-our-solar-system/" target="_top" rel="noopener">As I reported in June</a></strong>,  in regard to the first point, scientists have observed a <strong><a href="http://voyager.gsfc.nasa.gov/heliopause/heliopause/v1pgh.html" target="_top" rel="noopener">sustained increase</a></strong> in galactic cosmic rays during recent months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Earth Awareness Fair was this last weekend and I should be reporting on that. But these two women were there, Clada Parker and Jenn Bormann. They are with Roselawn Memorial Park and Butler Funeral home respectively. I am going to do Roselawn today and Butler tomorrow. I just love these guys. They had a woven basket casket with an optional silk liner with them on Saturday. But they have so many options it is real exciting. This is their Facebook page and their website:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Roselawn-Memorial-Park/121946907815445">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Roselawn-Memorial-Park/121946907815445</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.roselawninfo.com/">http://www.roselawninfo.com/</a></p>
<p>And here is a great little write up on them:</p>

<h2><a title="Permanent Link to Are There Green Cemeteries in Illinois?" href="http://wakethememory.com/blog/are-there-green-cemeteries-in-illinois/" rel="bookmark"> Are There Green Cemeteries in Illinois?</a></h2>
<div>July 19th, 2010</div>
<p>I am happy to report that the answer is finally, <strong>YES</strong>!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Green Burial Council</em> in California recently approved Roselawn Memorial Park for green burials. You can now be buried in Illinois without a casket, without embalming, without anything but a shroud if you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not personally think that a green burial ground has to be approved by the Green Burial Council, but they have some strict standards that make sense, and their mission is great. In a previous life, I worked in the architectural world, and saw first-hand what it was like dealing with the logistics of becoming LEED certified, and know how hard it can be. Additionally, it is very expensive to become “Certified Organic”. I think it’s worthwhile to recognize any cemetery or burial product willing to become more natural, and I will support any company that tries to be better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is their information. They do not seem to have a working website yet. I will keep you posted and update after I contact them directly.</p>

<h3><a href="http://earlywarn.blogspot.com/2011/02/libya-oil-updates.html">Libyan Oil Grinding to a Halt</a></h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s the latest:</p>
<p>At least 300kbd-400kbd of oil production are shut-in already, and likely more, but the <a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFLDE71M16J20110223">situation is still confusing</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>As much as a quarter of Libyan oil output has been shut  down, Reuters calculations showed on Wednesday, as unrest prompted oil  companies to warn of production cuts in Africa&#8217;s third-largest producer.</p>
<p>Austria&#8217;s OMV said on Wednesday it might be heading for a full  production shutdown in Libya. Total, Repsol, Eni and BASF have also said  they are either slowing or stopping output.</p>
<p>The latest comments point to a growing impact on oil output from Libya,  which produces 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of high-quality oil, or  almost 2 percent of world output. About 1.3 million bpd is exported,  mainly to Europe.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2052961,00.html">Time Magazine&#8217;s Robert Baer</a>, anonymous sources close to Gaddafi say he is now giving orders to sabotage Libya&#8217;s oil industry:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s been virtually no reliable information coming out of  Tripoli, but a source close to the Gaddafi regime I did manage to get  hold of told me the already terrible situation in Libya will get much  worse. Among other things, Gaddafi has ordered security services to  start sabotaging oil facilities. They will start by blowing up several  oil pipelines, cutting off flow to Mediterranean ports. The sabotage,  according to the insider, is meant to serve as a message to Libya&#8217;s  rebellious tribes: It&#8217;s either me or chaos.</p></blockquote>
<p>Libyan ports are <a href="http://www.portworld.com/news/i100899/Cargo_ports_in_Libya_closed_due_to_escalating_violence">shutting down</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Libyan cargo port operations have shut down due to increasing violence sweeping the country, Reuters has reported.</p>
<p>Operations at Tripoli, Benggazi and Misurata Mediterranean ports, which  handle general cargo and container shipping, have closed.</p></blockquote>
<p>In particular, oil exports appear to be <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international-business/libya-oil-ports-disrupted-italy-ready-to-use-gas-stocks/articleshow/7552829.cms">halting completely</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Operations at Libyan oil ports were disrupted by a lack of  communications, trade sources said, and flows from marine oil terminals  in Libya were halted on Tuesday, an Italian government source said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The situation is worrying. This morning the oil terminals were blocked in Libya,&#8221; the government source said.</p>
<p>It was not possible to get through by phone to Libyan oil ports or shipping agents on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is out,&#8221; said a source with a major oil company. &#8220;We can&#8217;t  get through to anyone. Our operations people say contact is impossible  with the shipping agents, port officials, anyone. The lines are all  down.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The country appears to be <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/24/world/africa/24libya.html?_r=1&amp;hp">descending into civil war</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya kept his grip on the  capital on Wednesday, but large areas of the east of the country  remained out of his control amid indications that the fighting had  reached the northwest of the country around Tripoli.</p>
<p>Libyans fleeing across the country’s western border to Tunisia reported  fighting over the past two nights in the town of Sabratha, home of an  important Roman archeological site 50 miles west of Tripoli. Reuters  reported that thousands of Libyan forces loyal to Col. Qaddafi had  deployed there.</p>
<p>“The revolutionary committees are trying to kill everyone who is against  Qaddafi,” said a doctor from Sabratha who had just left the country,  but who declined to give his name because he wanted to return.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, as for the oil production losses, the Saudi&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/23/business/global/23oil.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">say they stand ready</a> to make up the difference:</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and read the rest. More tomorrow I am afraid.</p>

<h2><a title="Gen. Hugh Shelton: Bush Administration Officials Pushed to Go to War With Iraq 'Almost to the Point of Insubordination'" href="http://videocafe.crooksandliars.com/heather/gen-hugh-shelton-bush-administration-offic">Gen. Hugh Shelton: Bush Administration Officials Pushed to Go to War With Iraq &#8216;Almost to the Point of Insubordination&#8217;</a></h2>
<p>This Week&#8217;s Christiane Amanpour talked to former Joint Chief Chair  Gen. Hugh Shelton about the rush to invade Iraq by members of the Bush  administration which he described as &#8220;almost to the point of  insubordination.&#8221; Color any of us that were paying attention at the time  not surprised by this latest revelation. The PNAC crowd surrounding him  in the White House were <a title="PNAC Iraq Clinton Letter" rel="footnote" href="http://www.newamericancentury.org/iraqclintonletter.htm">pushing to invade Iraq</a> long before Bush was selected by our Supreme Court to be president or becoming members of his Cabinet.</p>
<blockquote><p>AMANPOUR: Let&#8217;s go back to when you were Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs and even slightly afterwards, when President Bush decided  to go to war in Iraq. You talk about it was based on faulty intelligence  and indeed on lies and deceit, but you also say something about  insubordination. You say, for instance, during meetings, &#8220;some people  were kept on after Bush had tendered his opinion and issued an  instruction based on that opinion. Yet certain strong-willed individuals  seemed to disregard him and forge ahead with their own agendas, almost  to the point of insubordination.&#8221; That&#8217;s a very strong indictment.</p>
<p>SHELTON: Well, there was a very strong push in those days for us to  go into Iraq, and there was absolutely no intelligence, zero, that  pointed toward &#8212; pointed toward the Iraqis. It was all Al Qaeda, Osama  bin Laden. And yet there was an element there that was &#8212; that was  pushing to go into Iraq at the same time.</p>
<p>AMANPOUR: But what do you mean by insubordination?</p>
<p>SHELTON: The fact that the president says himself, we&#8217;re not going to  do that right now, let&#8217;s focus on Afghanistan, the Taliban and Al  Qaeda. Yet below the surface, we still had the sentiment that said,  let&#8217;s keep planning for Iraq just in case we can convince him that we  can go.</p>
<p>AMANPOUR: And you think they could have convinced him?</p>
<p>SHELTON: Not at that time. I think that, as President Bush told me at  Camp David, you know, I just don&#8217;t see it. You know, we may go get  Saddam and take him out, but it will be at a time and place of our  choosing. It won&#8217;t be as a part of the Afghanistan operation. He got it  from day one. When he was briefed by the CIA…</p>
<p>AMANPOUR: So you&#8217;re saying he was pushed into it?</p>
<p>SHELTON: I think eventually that that same drumbeat continued, and  Afghanistan, remember, was going very, very well. The drumbeat back here  in Washington was still pushing, coming out of the Pentagon, let&#8217;s go  to Iraq, let&#8217;s get &#8212; take him out. And he finally said, let&#8217;s go. We  walked out on the limb before we could build a coalition of the &#8212;  either the United Nations or NATO, one of the two.</p>
<p>AMANPOUR: You&#8217;re very &#8212; you have some harsh words about  then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Is he part of the group that  you are targeting here?</p>
<p>SHELTON: Well, I personally like Secretary Rumsfeld, but he was part  of the group, he and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz, that continued to push  to go into Iraq. And I think that&#8217;s been documented on a number of  occasions.</p></blockquote>
<p>And making me wonder how much this interview was edited, I transcribed the portion of the video above. It&#8217;s not included in <a title=" Tim Kaine" rel="footnote" href="http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/week-transcript-tim-kaine/story?id=11957754">ABC&#8217;s transcript</a>. The portion below however, is in ABC&#8217;s transcript but missing from the video.</p>
<blockquote><p>AMANPOUR: But you also say that in terms of dealing with  defense secretaries that Secretary Rumsfeld was more in the (INAUDIBLE)  mold, which you said was, you know, based more on sort of heavy pushing  and on those kinds of relationships.</p>
<p>SHELTON: And those were my observations. I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to  work for a number of secretaries of defense while I was in Pentagon.  And, for example, Secretary Bill Cohen, great team-builders, tremendous  leader, (INAUDIBLE), made you want to do things because they were the  right things to do and because we all pulled together to get it done.</p>
<p>But the leadership that Secretary Rumsfeld brought was totally different.</p></blockquote>

<p>More tomorrow.</p>
