										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know it has been awhile since I did a residential post. I know this started out as a blog about residential energy needs and services. You know, energy efficient roofs, HVAC equipment and other such stuff. But years ago, I got off on energy related environmental stuff and then eventually Global Warming. Then anti-Nuclear stuff. Finally just raw Environmental stuff like obnoxious polluting and horrible deaths. Well today a gentleman named Chris Winters reached out and touched me so I am touching him back, so to speak. As always, I can vouch for his tips because they are somewhat general, but anything specific he is pitching I can not (For instance AC controllers &#8211; which his company sells). Also I may have put up this as an addenda to any earlier piece, so if i did forgive me.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cielowigle.com/blog/energy-saving-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.cielowigle.com/blog/energy-saving-tips/</a></p>
<p>No matter what the season, energy usage tends to increase one way or another. With long running air conditioning and increased wash cycles of sweaty laundry in summer, to high heating usage and wash cycles of bulkier laundry in winter, we simply cannot operate without electricity.</p>
<p>We can be extremely energy efficient and follow energy saving tips and tricks to ingrain some environmentally friendly habits.</p>
<p>Following energy saving tips is essential to lower your costs, but it is also important to decrease your ecological footprint.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/2020/08/generation-green-is-leading-the-sustainability-agenda/">millennials and Gen Z nicknamed “generation green”</a>, there is a strong focus on energy saving, and rightly so. However, global warming is rising more rapidly than ever, and the term ‘climate emergency’ is being used rather than climate change to highlight the situation’s intensity.</p>
<p>All industries such as <a href="https://www.cielowigle.com/blog/climate-change/">HVAC are revolutionizing their technology to act on climate change</a>. Since home appliances and devices are a major contributor to our energy consumption, utilizing smart devices such as smart thermostats or <a href="https://www.cielowigle.com/">smart controllers for air conditioners</a> can make a huge difference on your bills!</p>
<p>Let’s get right to it. Here are 21 energy saving tips that can easily help you decrease your energy consumption:</p>
<h2 id="h-1-use-energy-efficient-appliances">1. Use Energy Efficient Appliances</h2>
<p>Energy efficient appliances are specially designed to consume minimum energy to complete the same tasks that you’d perform with normal appliances.  In addition, some</p>

<h2><strong>1. Magnetized Refrigerators</strong></h2>
<p>Research and development of new refrigeration technologies has helped to increase residential energy savings. It is estimated that refrigerators sold in the U.S. use about <a href="http://www.climatetechwiki.org/technology/fridges">60% less energy</a> today than they did twenty years ago. While the cost of an energy efficient refrigerator can be more expensive, in the long term, the cost to keep it running is much more cost effective than a less efficient model.</p>
<p>In order for companies to sell refrigerators that are eligible for energy savings, they must meet specific <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/files/specs//private/ENERGY%20STAR Final Version 5.0 Residential Refrigerators and Freezers Program Requirements.pdf">Energy Star program requirements</a>. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets the criteria for this program.</p>
<p>As part of the Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy?s funding program, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and General Electric have teamed up on a <a href="http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/downloads/magnetocaloric-refrigeration">magentocaloric refrigeration research and development project</a>. Their goal is to build a residential refrigerator that consumes <a href="http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/10/f18/emt50_momen_042414.pdf">25% less energy</a> than the current competition. Instead of using vapor compression, the team is using a technology known as the magnetocaloric effect (MCE). It?s a process where temperature is controlled by a changing magnetic field. This approach eliminates the use of</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>My name is Tyler and I&#8217;m a member of GreenTeensClub. We&#8217;re spreading resources that help make our planet a little healthier, like this home energy efficiency guide: https://www.basementguides.com/basement-and-home-energy/</p>
<p>I think your site is a great place to share this resource: /censys/date/2015/05</p>
<p>The page includes the biggest culprits of energy waste in a home, tips for locating the source of energy-waste issues, and how to lower your bills while reducing your footprint.</p>
<p>Please help us spread awareness of the importance of making homes more energy efficient. Even if we only get a few people to make minor changes, then we&#8217;ve made a huge difference.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />

More buyers see the value of it, and more builders and sellers are starting to make changes in that direction. There is still a long way to go before energy efficiency and reducing waste becomes the standard for new homes and improved existing homes, but a larger pool of buyers demanding these features can help move the needle bit by bit.</div>

Todays article is a bit old but its message is timeless. We have been concentrating on single devices like furnaces, refrigerators, windows seen as a whole instead of a holistic approach to a house.</p>

<h1 class="article-page-heading">We’re Doing Residential Energy Efficiency All Wrong</h1>
<div class="img-desc hidden-xs">
<p>Nate Adams says radical changes are needed in the home-performance business.</p>
<div class="meta"><span class="by-info">by Nate Adams<br />
September 08, 2015 </span></div>
</div>
<p>Utilities are now spending nearly <a href="http://sheltongrp.com/7-billion-later/">$7 billion a year</a> on energy-efficiency programs. It seems we have little to show for it aside from expensive consultants who will model any results you would like.</p>
<p>These programs tend to focus their marketing on the energy savings or money savings from the projects. Consumers don’t care. If they did, we would see geometric growth instead of a resounding &#8220;meh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others focus on better financing products, slicker sales pitches, faster energy audits, higher rebates or any of a myriad of other things.</p>
<p>In the residential sector, none of these are the problem. The lack of sales is the problem.</p>
<p>Projects are not being sold and implemented in substantial numbers. We need to slow it down, build relationships with consumers and educate them, learn and think systemically about the problems they have, and arrive at solutions that fit homeowner budgets.</p>

<p>Go there and read alot. It is a long article. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I am writing this to avoid writing about the worst piece of Illinois energy legislation in my lifetime. But it is true that this is a great way to save energy and extend the life of your equipment. In addition the site has other useful cleaning tips.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/cleaning/worst-cleaning-jobs-made-easy/cleaning-behind-under-refrigerator">http://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/cleaning/worst-cleaning-jobs-made-easy/cleaning-behind-under-refrigerator</a></p>
<h1 class="lead-headline">The Worst Cleaning Jobs Made Easy</h1>
<h2 class="slide-title">Dirty Job No. 7: Cleaning Behind and Under the Refrigerator</h2>
<p><strong>Time it takes:</strong> 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Lots of dust on the coils can cause a refrigerator to run inefficiently. And dust under the refrigerator can mix with moisture from the air to gum up the finish on your floor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Pull out the refrigerator by grasping both sides and gently wiggling it toward you; some are on wheels, so this may be easier than you think. When you can, reach behind and pull the plug (your food will survive for the short time it takes to clean). If you have an ice maker, shut off the water supply first, just in case the hose comes loose.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To dislodge dust around the condenser coils (the wriggly apparatus in back), use a long, thin tool known as a refrigerator-coil brush (Rubbermaid, $9, <a href="http://www.acehardware.com/product/index.jsp?productId=1279693" target="_blank">acehardware.com</a>), then gently vacuum with a brush attachment. Some refrigerators have their condenser coils behind a removable grille in the front. If yours does, snap off or unscrew the grille and clean the coils, as above.</p>

<p>Go there, read and get clean. More next week.</p>

So, I decided to just type in that phrase and let Yahoo and Google go to town. For the next couple of weeks at least I will publish the results. I like these folks disclaimer right up front.</p>

<p>In 2013, a project called My Micro NY won a design competition for the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-smallest-apartments-yet-are-being-built-in-new-york-city-and-its-just-300-square-feet-2012-7">New York&#8217;s first &#8220;micro apartments&#8221;</a> sponsored by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.</p>
<p>Intended to create affordable housing for singles in New York City, those promised prefabricated affordable units are finally being assembled in the Brooklyn Navy Yard and will be unveiled this spring in Manhattan&#8217;s Kips Bay, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/realestate/micro-apartments-tiny-homes-prefabricated-in-brooklyn.html?_r=1#">according to The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>The city&#8217;s first &#8220;micro&#8221; building will have 55 rental apartments, all ranging from 260- to 360-square-feet with big windows, ample storage space, and Juliet balconies.</p>
<p>Because the architects believed amenities are important to micro-unit dwellers, the building will also have a public meeting space, café, and common rooftop garden for residents, as well as a laundry room, residential storage space, a bike room, and fitness space.</p>
