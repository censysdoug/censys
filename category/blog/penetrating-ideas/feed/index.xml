										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>But we’re also far from totally unf$@%*ed!”</p>
<p>I am quoting here. I always try to stay positive and I know regular readers find that hard to believe because I have been saying for awhile that Human&#8217;s will go extinct. Still I like to think that my Stepson Gus, and my nieces and nephews like Taylor and Cory will have pleasant lives of their own. I hope that their kids will too. So here is an article that spreads some of that positivity.</p>
<p>This article is from last year but, spread the old news, same as the new news.</p>

<p>The deadly consequences of climate change only grew clearer this year, as record-shattering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/11/climate/deaths-pacific-northwest-heat-wave.html">heat waves</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/09/02/heres-what-made-new-york-city-flooding-so-devastating/">floods</a>, and wildfires <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/world/asia/china-flooding-deaths.html">killed</a> <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-mediterranean-heatwaves-excess-deaths-climate-change-cop26-glasgow-ipcc/">thousands</a> and strained the limits of our disaster responders.</p>
<p>In the closing days of 2021, scientists <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/978762">warned</a> that the eastern ledge of a Florida-size glacier is about to snap off of Antarctica and US legislators found they may have <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/12/joe-biden-joe-manchin-climate-deal/621092/">flubbed their best chance</a> in a decade to enact sweeping climate policies.</p>

<div class="gutenbergContent__content--1FgGp html_2">
<p>But amid these stark signs, there were also indications that momentum is beginning to build behind climate action. Indeed, there’s good reason now to believe that the world could at least sidestep the worst dangers of global warming.</p>
<p>Princeton energy researcher Jesse Jenkins accurately, and colorfully, pinpointed the weird moment we’ve arrived at in <a href="https://twitter.com/JesseJenkins/status/1470398603336335364?s=20">a recent tweet</a>: “We’re no longer totally f$%@ed. But we’re also far from totally unf$@%*ed!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are however safer Nuclear Reactors. But the real drawback is that even France &#8211; that spent 600 million Euro son there&#8217;s &#8211;  gave up their research one 2 years ago.  So Bill Gates may be one of the smartest men on the planet, but for a badly mixed metaphor, he is barking up the wrong tree. Since sodium remains liquid at high temperatures &#8211; instead of turning into steam &#8211; sodium reactors do not need the heavy pressurized hulls of PWRs. But sodium burns on contact with air and explodes when plunged into water. Like I said &#8220;safer&#8221; reactor. Then as always, there is the problem with what to do with the fuel.</p>

<p>KEMMERER, Wyoming (AP) — In this sleepy Wyoming town that has relied on coal for over a century, a company founded by the man who revolutionized personal computing is launching an ambitious project to counter climate change: A nationwide reboot of nuclear energy technology.</p>
<p>Until recently, Kemmerer was little-known for anything except J.C. Penney&#8217;s first store and some 55-million-year-old fish fossils in quarries down the road.</p>
<p>Then in November, a company started by Bill Gates, TerraPower, announced it had chosen Kemmerer for a nontraditional, sodium-cooled nuclear reactor that will bring on workers from a local coal-fired power plant scheduled to close soon.</p>
<p>The demonstration project comes as many U.S. states see <a class="link " href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-business-environment-and-nature-bill-gates-nuclear-power-90689f06e1cf0271710e07e8b3ba8e09" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:nuclear emerging as an answer to fill the gap" data-rapid_p="8" data-v9y="1">nuclear emerging as an answer to fill the gap</a> as a transition away from coal, oil and natural gas to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Many residents in Kemmerer, where the population of 2,700 is little-changed since the 1990s, see the TerraPower project as a much-needed economic boost because Rocky Mountain Power&#8217;s Naughton power plant will close 2025. The plant employs about 230 and a mine that supplies coal exclusively to the plant — and is also at risk of closing if it can&#8217;t find another customer — almost 300.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By &#8220;pixie dust&#8221; I mean that a lot of environmentalists make it sound like there will be no chaos from fossil fuel use to renewal energy systems and that is not true. Dislodging fossil fuel will result in job loses, factories closing and possibly the lack of transportation (for example) for chunks of the population. Especially those not preparing for it now. Lives will be lost. This is the fault of capitalism but it is what we have. Also the reverse is true, as demand for clean energy grows, whole resources will be created from scratch (rare earths for instance). The earth will be scarred, employment will be created with much wrenching and tearing. Lives will be lost. Capitalism will prevail. Just think of what happened when oil and gas took over and from the Luddites. This is a Really Long article about all of that and it only scratches the surface.</p>

<p>It is not hard to understand why people dream of a future defined by clean energy. As greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow and as extreme weather events become more frequent and harmful, the current efforts to move beyond fossil fuels appear woefully inadequate. Adding to the frustration, the geopolitics of oil and gas are alive and well—and as fraught as ever. Europe is in the throes of a full-fledged energy crisis, with staggering electricity prices forcing businesses across the continent to shutter and energy firms to declare bankruptcy, positioning Russian President Vladimir Putin to take advantage of his neighbors’ struggles by leveraging his country’s natural gas reserves. In September, blackouts reportedly led Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng to instruct his country’s state-owned energy companies to secure supplies for winter at any cost. And as oil prices surge above $80 per barrel, the United States and other energy-hungry countries are pleading with major producers, including Saudi Arabia, to ramp up their output, giving Riyadh more clout in a newly tense relationship and suggesting the limits of Washington’s energy “independence.”</p>
<p>Proponents of clean energy hope (and sometimes promise) that in addition to mitigating climate change, the energy transition will help make tensions over energy resources a thing of the past. It is true that clean energy will transform geopolitics—just not necessarily in the ways many of its champions expect. The transition will reconfigure many elements of international politics that have shaped the global system since at least World War II, significantly affecting the sources of national power, the process of globalization, relations among the great powers, and the ongoing economic convergence of developed countries and developing ones. The process will be messy at best. And far from fostering comity and cooperation, it will likely produce new forms of competition and confrontation long before a new, more copacetic geopolitics takes shape.</p>
<p>Talk of a smooth transition to clean energy is fanciful: there is no way that the world can avoid major upheavals as it remakes the entire energy system, which is the lifeblood of the global economy and underpins the geopolitical order. Moreover, the conventional wisdom about who will gain and who will lose is frequently off base.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Any Electrical Generation System can generate too much energy in a system where output is unknown. To put it another way where consumption is unknown. And this is just my opinion but I am betting any system would rather have too much than too little product or produce to sell. If the system is really large a little bit too much is way better then a little bit less. But what to do with the excess?  By the way. contrary to this article, you can turn energy generation off, so long as you know when you have to turn it back on.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/what-do-we-do-too-much-renewable-energy">https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/what-do-we-do-too-much-renewable-energy</a></p>
<h2>What Do We Do With Too Much Renewable Energy?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not easy to turn off a wind turbine, but the electricity has to go somewhere</p>
<p>By <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/authors/natasha-khullar-relph">Natasha Khullar Relph</a> | <span class="pubdate">Aug 19 2020</span></p>
<p>We know that green energy is good, but can there be too much of a good thing?</p>
<p>For instance, with unusually low demand during the COVID-19 lockdown, the United Kingdom’s power consumption fell by nearly 20 percent this summer. That caused a surge in unused green energy. In May, the National Grid asked for emergency powers to switch off solar and wind farms and warned of blackouts and a “significant risk of disruption to security of supply.”</p>
<p>Britain is certainly not alone. As the transition to renewable energy gathers pace, early adopter regions like Germany, Denmark, and California are finding that, counterintuitively, too much green power poses problems for their energy supply. Electricity, when generated, must be used instantaneously, and therefore the amount of generation and the amount of demand must be balanced perfectly at all times. This can cause surges in the grid unless there are means of storing or diverting this excess.</p>
<p>Finding that perfect balance is complicated at the best of times, says Cisco DeVries, an energy expert and the CEO of OhmConnect as well as a former aide to the secretary of energy during the Clinton administration. It’s far worse when you throw in sudden surprises such as a global pandemic. Suddenly, people are consuming more power at home, but factories are standing empty. “We’re changing when and where we’re using [energy], and we’re doing it in a way that’s never been done before,” he says. Add the challenges of disconnecting solar power plants and wind farms to changing use patterns, he notes, and you’ve “exponentially complicated the balancing of supply and demand.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MACC doesn&#8217;t sound nearly as good as MADD but I suppose it could always work. I mean mothers are a potent source of social change. However, it took 100 years for them to get the vote and we do not have 100 years. I guess if my Grandma, Mable Ross, had started such a movement we would be in pretty good shape now. It also seems like a pretty &#8220;white&#8221; movement. I suppose that is where you have to start. GOOD LUCK LADIES!</p>

<p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading">Three years ago, I had a baby. I won’t go into the details, but suffice it to say that she is extremely cute, and I enjoy being her mother. A few months after her birth, I was scrolling on my phone, and I came across news of a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It described a future world that will have experienced 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming. In this world, the oceans are acidifying, and most coral reefs have been bleached to death; hundreds of millions of people face severe drought, and even more face deadly heat waves. The kicker? This planet—the 1.5-degree-warmer one—was the best-case scenario. Scientists were using the report to <a class="external-link" href="https://www.wri.org/blog/2018/10/half-degree-and-world-apart-difference-climate-impacts-between-15-c-and-2-c-warming" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.wri.org/blog/2018/10/half-degree-and-world-apart-difference-climate-impacts-between-15-c-and-2-c-warming&quot;}">argue</a> that we should try to shoot for that. The Paris climate accord aims to limit the global-temperature increase to “below 2 degrees Celsius.” At present, both goals seem like a stretch. According <a class="external-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/02/26/un-climate-emissions/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/02/26/un-climate-emissions/&quot;}">to the U.N.</a>, all of the world’s current pledges would only cut carbon emissions by one per cent—a far cry from the nearly fifty per cent needed this decade in order to meet our goals. So, 1.5 degrees is coming. According to <a class="external-link" href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-when-might-the-world-exceed-1-5c-and-2c-of-global-warming" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-when-might-the-world-exceed-1-5c-and-2c-of-global-warming&quot;}">some researchers</a>, we could get there around 2030, when my daughter will be entering middle school.</p>
<p class="paywall">I did some further Googling: What will the world look like when she’s middle-aged? When her <em>children</em> are middle-aged? I found a <a class="external-link" href="https://climate-life-events.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://climate-life-events.herokuapp.com/&quot;}">Web site</a> that lets you plot major events in your child’s life against the projected global-temperature increase. Even <a class="external-link" href="https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/&quot;}">the “optimistic” scenarios</a> show the world warming two degrees during her lifetime. The more realistic scenarios—the ones based on what countries are actually doing to reduce emissions, not what they’ve pledged—show it heating up to three degrees. There is a universe of difference between those numbers, but they are <a class="external-link" href="https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/impacts-climate-change-one-point-five-degrees-two-degrees/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/impacts-climate-change-one-point-five-degrees-two-degrees/&quot;}">both awful</a>, bringing rising seas, heat waves, food and water shortages, wildfires, droughts, and hurricanes, not to mention the loss of biodiversity. Naturally, this line of research prompted a nervous breakdown. I had always understood, intellectually, that climate change was an existential threat, but it was only after my daughter’s birth that it became real to me.</p>
<p class="paywall">I’m not alone. According to the <a class="external-link" href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/global-warmings-six-americas-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/global-warmings-six-americas-in-2020/&quot;}">Yale Program on Climate Change Communications</a>, twenty-six per cent of Americans report feeling “alarmed” about climate change, up from less than half that number six years ago. About the same number of people describe themselves as “concerned”—which seems like the way you should feel about your child’s “Animal Crossing” addiction, not the fact that the Thwaites Glacier could slide into the ocean during his lifetime, flooding coastal cities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This according to 13,000 scientists who think it is now or never for things to change. This is a stunning development. One I never thought would happen until the END. And I will be honest here, we are nowhere near the end. I think we have at least 20 years before things are completely out of control. I never thought I hear these kinds of statement until it was too late. Like hearing &#8220;the Titanic is sinking&#8221; when it is already half way down and there is no going back. But then again &#8211; maybe i better rethink. Anway:</p>

<p>An emergency is a serious situation that requires immediate action. When someone calls 911 because they can’t breathe, that’s an emergency. When someone stumbles on the sidewalk because their chest is pounding and their lips are turning blue, that’s an emergency. Both people require help right away. Multiply those individuals by millions of people who have similar symptoms, and it constitutes the biggest global health emergency in a century: the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Now consider the following scenarios: A hurricane blasts Florida. A California dam bursts because floods have piled water high up behind it. A sudden, record-setting cold snap cuts power to the entire state of Texas. These are also emergencies that require immediate action. Multiply these situations worldwide, and you have the biggest environmental emergency to beset the earth in millennia: climate change.</p>
<p>Given the circumstances,<em> Scientific American</em> has agreed with major news outlets worldwide to start using the term “climate emergency” in its coverage of climate change. An official statement about this decision, and the impact we hope it can have throughout the media landscape, is below.</p>
<p><em>The planet is heating up way too fast. It’s time for journalism to recognize that the climate emergency is here</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the story of a man named Boswell and Boswell had a very lovely wife (Sorry Brady Bunch) who turned the San Joaquin Valley from a lush river and lake wildlife area into the nation&#8217;s bread basket. Also how it destroyed a massive habitat This was and is a despicable enterprise. Sort of on the order of a Nuclear Testing site in the desert. Or a Copper Mine for that matter. If you want to hear a video about it. There is This:</p>

<h2 class="wsite-content-title">Hydrologic History of the Tulare Basin</h2>
<div></div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Tulare Basin historically supported an amazing complex of wetland habitats, unique in the world. This largely flat and arid region served as the floodplain for water flowing west from the southern Sierra Nevada, north from the Transverse Ranges, as well as from small intermittent arroyos flowing east from the Coast Ranges. Oak woodlands and riparian forests formed green corridors across the broad prairie on the eastern edge of the Tulare Basin. Freshwater tule marshes and alkaline wetlands adorned the slow-moving sloughs and shallow margins of Kern, Buena Vista, Goose, Tulare, and Summit lakes. Emergent marsh vegetation, such as tules and cattails, grew in permanent standing water at the shallow edges of freshwater wetlands. Upslope from the marshes, water intermittently flooded iodine bush scrub and alkali grassland habitats.</p>
<p>This highly-productive, shallow water system supported abundant populations of endemic lake-adapted fishes such that American white pelicans (Pelacanus erythrorhynchos) nested by the thousands on islands in Tulare Lake and Buena Vista Lake. The Tulare Basin&#8217;s extensive wetland habitats historically attracted significant numbers of resident and migratory waterbirds, including grebes, pelicans, cormorants, herons, egrets, ibises, geese, swans, ducks, rails, sandhill cranes, plovers, stilts, avocets, sandpipers, phalaropes, gulls, and terns.</p>
<p>The conversion of this water system to a lake-and-slough wetland to agriculture began in the mid-1800s when European settlers began to build canals and diversion structures to irrigate their crops.  This early irrigation infrastructure upstream from Tulare Lake slowly cut off the lake from its source waters, shrinking the lake&#8217;s footprint.  By 1899 &#8211; less than 50 years after irrigation was initiated &#8211; Tulare Lake went dry for the first time in history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the shell game for the oil companies was always &#8211; who can we get to take this stuff? Meaning solid supposedly recyclable plastics. For awhile anybody would take the &#8220;stuff&#8221; to burn it and Americans are like &#8211; out of sight out of mind. When they got caught at that, then they started exporting for &#8220;conversion&#8221; to other substances and China bought that one big time. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, plastic can be recycled but it is MORE expensive to do so than to throw it away. PLUS you can only recycle it once or twice and then it has to be thrown away anyway. YUP recycling was always a lie. But ain&#8217;t capitalism grand.</p>

<p>Laura Leebrick, a manager at Rogue Disposal &amp; Recycling in southern Oregon, is standing on the end of its landfill watching an avalanche of plastic trash pour out of a semitrailer: containers, bags, packaging, strawberry containers, yogurt cups.</p>
<p>None of this plastic will be turned into new plastic things. All of it is buried.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me that felt like it was a betrayal of the public trust,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I had been lying to people &#8230; unwittingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rogue, like most recycling companies, had been sending plastic trash to China, but when China shut its doors two years ago, Leebrick scoured the U.S. for buyers. She could find only someone who wanted white milk jugs. She sends the soda bottles to the state.</p>
<p>But when Leebrick tried to tell people the truth about burying all the other plastic, she says people didn&#8217;t want to hear it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember the first meeting where I actually told a city council that it was costing more to recycle than it was to dispose of the same material as garbage,&#8221; she says, &#8220;and it was like heresy had been spoken in the room: You&#8217;re lying. This is gold. We take the time to clean it, take the labels off, separate it and put it here. It&#8217;s gold. This is valuable.&#8221;</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and read. Next time you see an empty gallon milk jug. Light it on fire in protest. More next week.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>P.S. Today is recycling day in Riverton and they just took my plastic away. hahahahaa</p>
