<h1>Coal, nuclear plant operator files for bankruptcy, asks Trump for a bailout</h1>
<h2>FirstEnergy&#8217;s request comes after regulator struck down an industry-wide bailout plan.</h2>

<p>On Saturday, power corporation FirstEnergy placed its coal and nuclear generation units <a href="https://cms.arstechnica.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=226681&amp;action=edit">under chapter 11 bankruptcy</a>. Although coal and nuclear plants across the country have struggled to compete with the low prices of natural gas, FirstEnergy&#8217;s filing is unique because it stands to take on a political dimension. Just two days before FirstEnergy&#8217;s bankruptcy filing, the company petitioned the Department of Energy (DOE) for an emergency bailout, <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/firstenergy-asks-doe-for-emergency-action-to-save-pjm-coal-nuke-plants/520280/">citing concerns about reliability</a>.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p>The petition could reinvigorate a debate started by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/energy-secretary-proposes-rule-to-make-grid-managers-favor-coal-nuclear/">proposed a rule</a> last year to change how coal and nuclear plants are compensated for their power. The rule was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/federal-regulator-denies-rick-perrys-proposal-to-compensate-coal-nuclear/">denied by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> (FERC), which said that there was not enough evidence to justify changing how coal and nuclear are compensated.</p>
<p>FirstEnergy disparaged FERC&#8217;s decision in <a href="https://statepowerproject.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/fes-202c-application.pdf">its Thursday petition</a> (PDF), claiming that &#8220;as a result of FERC’s and the RTO&#8217;s [Regional Transmission Organization&#8217;s] failure to address this crisis, swift and decisive action is needed <em>now</em> to address this imminent loss of nuclear and coal-fired baseload generation and the threat to the electric grid that this loss poses&#8221; (emphasis FirstEnergy&#8217;s).</p>

<h1>City of Springfield touts second lake as potential backup for region, including Chatham</h1>

<blockquote><p>Springfield officials are emphasizing to permitting agencies that the city’s long-proposed backup water supply, Hunter Lake, could serve the entire region during a severe drought.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Mayor Jim Langfelder and other city officials met last week with representatives from the three agencies that Springfield needs permit approval from before the second lake could be built.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“If a drought hit, we’d be a regional source of water,” Langfelder said Monday.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Langfelder and Ted Meckes, City Water, Light and Power’s water division manager, met with representatives from the Army Corps of Engineers, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, following the Springfield City Council’s reaffirmation vote in July of a commitment to move forward with the Hunter Lake projec</p></blockquote>

<h1 class="instapaper_title">Rethinking extinction</h1>
<p><span class="author-wrapper-inner">by <a title="Read more articles by Stewart Brand" href="http://aeon.co/magazine/author/stewart-brand/" rel="author"><span class="instapaper_authorname">Stewart Brand</span></a></span></p>
<h2 class="single-excerpt">The idea that we are edging up to a mass extinction is not just wrong – it’s a recipe for panic and paralysis</h2>
<p>The way the public hears about conservation issues is nearly always in the mode of ‘[Beloved Animal] Threatened With Extinction’. That makes for electrifying headlines, but it misdirects concern. The loss of whole species is not the leading problem in conservation. The leading problem is the decline in wild animal populations, sometimes to a radical degree, often diminishing the health of whole ecosystems.</p>
<p>Viewing every conservation issue through the lens of extinction threat is simplistic and usually irrelevant. Worse, it introduces an emotional charge that makes the problem seem cosmic and overwhelming rather than local and solvable. It’s as if the entire field of human medicine were treated solely as a matter of death prevention. Every session with a doctor would begin: ‘Well, you’re dying. Let’s see if we can do anything to slow that down a little.’</p>
<p>Medicine is about health. So is conservation. And as with medicine, the trends for conservation in this century are looking bright. We are re-enriching some ecosystems we once depleted and slowing the depletion of others. Before I explain how we are doing that, let me spell out how exaggerated the focus on extinction has become and how it distorts the public perception of conservation.</p>
<p>Many now assume that we are in the midst of a human-caused ‘Sixth Mass Extinction’ to rival the one that killed off the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. But we’re not. The five historic mass extinctions eliminated 70 per cent or more of all species in a relatively short time. That is not going on now. ‘If all currently threatened species were to go extinct in a few centuries and that rate continued,’ began a recent <i>Nature</i> magazine introduction to a survey of wildlife losses, ‘the sixth mass extinction could come in a couple of centuries or a few millennia.’</p>

<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388416619401_30731">Sections 1-70(b)2 and 1-95(c) of the Hydraulic Fracturing Regulatory Act state that stripped topsoil is to be replaced with similar soil and the site returned to its pre-drilling condition.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388416619401_30733">Section 1-95(c) of the Act specifically states: “The operator shall restore any lands used by the operator other than the well site and production facility to a condition as closely approximating the pre-drilling conditions that existed before the land was disturbed for any stage of site preparation activities, drilling, and high volume horizontal hydraulic fracturing operations.”</p>
</div>
<div id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388416619401_30589">
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388416619401_30588">When drilling is anticipated to be completed in less than a year, Section 245.410(d) of the Rules stipulates that the topsoil is to stockpiled and stabilized to prevent erosion.  However, “In the event it is anticipated that the final reclamation shall take place in excess of one year from drilling the well, the topsoil may be disposed of in any lawful manner provided the permittee reclaims the site with topsoil of similar characteristics of the topsoil removed.&#8221;</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388416619401_30734">What is missing, and needed, in this section of the Rules is the stipulation that the replacement topsoil will be not only similar in characteristics of the topsoil removed, but also match the removed topsoil in VOLUME.   In fact, there is no place in the rules that requires measurement of the topsoil removed or measurement of the replacement topsoil.  Without such a requirement, it would be easy for an unscrupulous operator to replace the topsoil with smaller quantities than were originally removed.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1388416619401_30735">Revisions Needed:  When final reclamation is anticipated to exceed one year and topsoil is removed from the site, Section 245.410(d) must require measuring the volume of the removed topsoil and stipulate that the replacement topsoil will match both the quality AND quantity of the removed topsoil.</p>

<div id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1386165130315_39534">Comment:  In subsection (a), &#8220;Applicability&#8221;, DNR proposes that this rule apply ONLY to Class II  injection wells, not to any other.  DNR has not proposed any rules for fracking wells.  This is insufficient protection of the population in southern Illinois where citizens are at risk of a major earthquake.  Southern Illinois sits above two active seismic zones: the New Madrid and the Wabash Valley.</div>
<div id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1386165130315_39536">
<div id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1386165130315_39535">There are two distinct earthquake risks: (1) the risks from injection wells inducing earthquakes that would not otherwise occur and (2) the risks of substantial injuries and damages created when the toxic fracking fluid left in the ground, in pipelines, and in wells (injection and otherwise) is let loose as a result of a major earthquake.  There are NO rules establishing guidelines for stopping fracking wells in the event of earthquakes, and NO considerations for siting any wells specifically in active seismic zones.  That omission is a reckless disregard for the safety of Southern Illinois residents, their property, and the ecology of the region.</div>
<div id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1386165130315_39537">Furthermore, in light of recent studies (see below), the risk of earthquakes can extend far beyond local areas.  See:</div>

Researchers now say that the magnitude 5.7 earthquake near Prague, Okla., on Nov. 6, 2011, may also be the largest ever linked to wastewater injection. Felt as far away as Milwaukee, more than 800 miles away, the quake—the biggest ever recorded in Oklahoma&#8211;destroyed 14 homes, buckled a federal highway and left two people injured.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am 57 years old and it may all be down hill from here. Seriously. In humankind&#8217;s 100,000 year history we just threw a spear out of here. In terms of what we were promised &#8211; you know warp drive, aliens and foreign civilizations it is kind of drab; but in terms of goal posts, it is a huge leap. Some might even say a quantum leap. All I can say is WOW.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.chron.com/sciguy/2012/10/more-evidence-that-voyager-has-exited-the-solar-system/">http://blog.chron.com/sciguy/2012/10/more-evidence-that-voyager-has-exited-the-solar-system/</a></p>
<h1>More evidence that Voyager has exited the solar system</h1>
<div>Friday, October 5, 2012</div>
<p>A science blog with Eric Berger</p>
<p>Something very, very interesting is happening with <strong><a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_top" rel="noopener">Voyager 1</a></strong>, the human probe that’s the very farthest from Earth.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://voyager.gsfc.nasa.gov/heliopause/heliopause/recenthist.html" target="_top" rel="noopener">New data</a></strong> from the spacecraft, which I will discuss below, indicate Voyager 1 may have exited the solar system for good. If true, this would mark a truly historic moment for the human race — sending a spacecraft beyond the edge of our home solar system.</p>
<p>At last check, NASA scientists said they <strong><a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/news/signs_changing_fast.html" target="_top" rel="noopener">were not yet ready</a></strong> to officially declare that Voyager 1 had officially exited the solar system by crossing the <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliosphere" target="_top" rel="noopener">heliopause</a></strong>.</p>
<p>To cross this boundary scientists say they would need to observe three things:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>An increase in high-energy cosmic rays originating from outside our solar system</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> A drop in charged particles emanating from the sun.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>A change in the direction of the magnetic field.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.chron.com/sciguy/2012/06/voyager-1-may-have-officially-exited-our-solar-system/" target="_top" rel="noopener">As I reported in June</a></strong>,  in regard to the first point, scientists have observed a <strong><a href="http://voyager.gsfc.nasa.gov/heliopause/heliopause/v1pgh.html" target="_top" rel="noopener">sustained increase</a></strong> in galactic cosmic rays during recent months.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and read. More tomorrow.</p>

<p><em>This is the third in a series of blogs written by This American  Land host Caroline Raville on her recent experience shooting  a story  for season two at Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument. Read the  first two blogs in this series,<strong> <a href="http://www.thisamericanland.org/blog/?p=371" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument in Season Two</a> </strong>and <a href="http://www.thisamericanland.org/blog/?p=378" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Host Caroline Raville on Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument</strong>.</a></em></p>
<p>And now we are crossing over the mighty Paria River,” Dr. Titus observes.</p>
<p>I look down below. I see dirt and a puddle. Dr. Titus and Scott  Richardson are grinning at my incredulous look as we bump along the  pockmarked road. Apparently, this crack in the mud does become a river  occasionally. Escalante experiences extreme weather ranging from  boiling, fly-infested summers to frozen winters. Still, the evidence  before me seems to suggest that this place is in a constant state of dry  heat.</p>
<p>We drive deeper into the monument, and the paleontologists decide to  take a quick detour promising spectacular views. After a steep climb  with some seriously wicked turns, we find ourselves looking down on a  valley littered in rock formations. There are the tar colored hills  which look like a blackened sand dune. Further up, rust tinted rocks  roll in the shape of a dragon’s back. And above are the whitewashed  peaks dotted with green scrub brush. These layers are a physical  timeline that helps scientists to establish the changes in habitat that  occurred here. From ocean floor to swampland to the now arid desert,  Escalante has experienced some major changes during its existence due to  plate tectonics and the resulting mountain building.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Still it is kind of interesting. I wonder why no one spilled the beans. Was it because the bulk of their workers were blind and totally dependent on Kodak. I do not know but it is an amusing tale nonetheless.</p>
<p><a href="http://digg.com/newsbar/topnews/so_kodak_about_that_nuclear_reactor_in_your_basement">http://digg.com/newsbar/topnews/so_kodak_about_that_nuclear_reactor_in_your_basement</a></p>
<h1>So, Kodak &#8212; about that nuclear reactor in your basement</h1>
<p id="introP">It  seems that, until 2006, Kodak had a basement that housed a nuclear  reactor, complete with a cache of weapons-grade uranium. How did the  company get away with that?</p>
<p><a rel="author" href="http://www.cnet.com/profile/ChrisMatyszczyk/"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://asset2.cbsistatic.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim/2011/10/09/headshots_Chris_Matyszczyk_60x43.jpg" alt="Chris Matyszczyk" width="60" height="43" /></a> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.cnet.com/profile/ChrisMatyszczyk/">Chris Matyszczyk</a> May 14, 2012 11:16 AM PDT</p>
<p>Corporate America is a place of many layers.</p>
<p>Though fanciful movies made by drug-addled Hollywood directors  sometimes suggest that corporations are behind wars, most believe that  CEOs are just too harassed to find the time for that sort of action.</p>
<p>And yet, this morning Gizmodo <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5909961/kodak-had-a-secret-weapons+grade-nuclear-reactor-hidden-in-a-basement">has turned my head</a> toward <a href="http://www.democratandchronicle.com/article/20120511/NEWS01/305120021/Kodak-Park-nuclear-reactor">the explosive reporting</a> of The Democrat and Chronicle, the local newspaper of the Rochester, N.Y., area &#8212; home to Kodak.</p>
<p>This paper reveals that between 1978 and 2006, Kodak had a nuclear  reactor. No, not a picture of one. A real one &#8212; albeit a small one  intended for research &#8212; housed in its basement.</p>
<p>Surely, you might think that there&#8217;s some exaggeration here. And yet  it seems that this nuclear reactor contained three-and-a-half pounds of  enriched uranium. Highly enriched uranium, indeed, which some might  describe as &#8220;weapons-grade.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am sure that everyone in Rochester &#8212; not to mention, say, North  America &#8212; will be pleased to hear that nothing ever went wrong with  this reactor. No leaks. No strange explosions. It apparently bore no  responsibility for <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-57373826-17/end-of-an-era-kodak-discontinues-camera-business/">Kodak&#8217;s own implosion</a>, either.</p>
<p>Given that it was only dismantled in 2006, though, it is remarkable  that few locals &#8212; or, indeed, Kodak employees &#8212; knew anything about  this 14&#215;24-foot bunker</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I loved it when Jimmy Carter put up solar panels and I love it for the same reason when Michelle Obama put in a vegetable garden. It is telling of course that Ronald Regan tore the solar panels off the White House and destroyed them. The division in our culture is so clear. The White House had a vegetable garden all the way up to the 60s or so when it &#8220;fell out of favor&#8221;. Now it is back and it will be interesting to see what the next occupant does with it when he is elected.</p>

<h1>First Lady Michele Obama Plants Organic Vegetable Garden at White House</h1>
<h2>Obamas Hope White House Organic Garden Will Cause Healthy Lifestyles to Blossom</h2>
<p id="by">From <a rel="author" href="http://environment.about.com/bio/Larry-West-16812.htm">Larry West</a>, former About.com Guide</p>
<p>On March 20, 2009, First Lady Michele Obama celebrated the first day of  spring by using her famously well-toned biceps to pick up a shovel and  break ground for an organic vegetable garden at the White House. (See  the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/assets/documents/garden_layout.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official layout</a> [pdf] of the new White House garden.)</p>
<p><strong>Educating Children a Primary Goal of White House Garden</strong><br />
In talking with reporters about the new garden, the first lady got down  and dirty about the benefits of good nutrition and the need to educate  children, families and whole communities about the importance of a  healthful diet, especially at a time when obesity and diabetes have  become national health crises.</p>
<p>Twenty-three fifth graders from Bancroft Elementary School in  Washington, DC, helped the first lady dig up the 1,100-square-foot  garden plot on the south lawn of the White House, which is near the  tennis courts and the swing set the Obamas installed for their daughters  and can be seen by people passing by on E Street. The plan is to have  the students stay involved in planting, tending, harvesting and cooking  the presidential produce.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I did not know which article to go with today. They were both about environmental destruction in Turkey printed within the last 2 days. One was about the 1,600 hydro projects in Turkey to generate just 8 percent of their electricity, but flooding hundreds of thousands of acres of habitat and farmland. Also probably denying drinking water and irrigation to those downstream. OR the article about the cyanide leak from a mining tailings pond. Oh what the heck, cyanide is so much more fun.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.todayszaman.com/news-243375-environmental-disaster-looms-in-kutahya-after-tailings-failure.html">http://www.todayszaman.com/news-243375-environmental-disaster-looms-in-kutahya-after-tailings-failure.html</a></p>
<h1>Environmental disaster looms in Kütahya after tailings failure</h1>
<div>9 May 2011 / TODAY&#8217;S ZAMAN, ?STANBUL</div>
<div id="newsSpot"><span>Immediate measures  are needed to avert what could be an environmental disaster in Kütahya,  where the collapse of a tailings dam in a silver mining and refining  facility has led to concern, according to environmentalists and  scientists who continued to issue warnings on Monday.</span></div>
<p>However, officials have said all the necessary measures have been taken to prevent leakage.</p>
<p>A crisis desk was established in the province following the collapse  of the dam&#8217;s embankment on Saturday. The governor&#8217;s office has announced  that nearby villages could be evacuated. The facility, owned by the Eti  Silver Corporation, reportedly contains 15 million cubic meters of  cyanide. It is located 34 kilometers from the provincial capital, near  the village of Gümü?.</p>
<p>“We are calling for urgent measures,” said Mustafa Sat?lm??, the  Kütahya representative of the Turkish Foundation for Reforestation,  Protection of Natural Habitats and Combating Soil Erosion (TEMA). “If  not, it is certain that we&#8217;ll be faced with an environmental disaster  that will cause irreparable damage.” He said TEMA had grave concerns  about the situation. “The amount of disinformation [on a possible  cyanide leak in Kütahya] is enormous. We expect officials to make a  satisfactory statement on this. We feel that not making statements on  the issue won&#8217;t get us anywhere.”</p>
<p>Company workers continued work started on Saturday to prevent the  cyanide from flowing into the first stage of the dam, from where it  could leak outside, while work was also under way to strengthen the  embankments.</p>
<p>Sat?lm?? said although TEMA had been unable to acquire official  information from technical professionals, they had been able to  ascertain that a “severe risk” had formed in the tailing dam&#8217;s stages.  “The embankment between the second and third stages collapsed, and now  the entire burden is on the third stage. Immediate action is needed.”</p>
<p>The Turkish Union of Engineers and Architects&#8217; Chambers (TMMOB)  released a statement on Sunday saying that a possible leak would lead to  a disaster much worse than a spill of industrial waste in October at an  aluminum plant in western Hungary.</p>
