			<p>OK so you have picked the site for your garden. You have picked the size of your garden. You have turned the soil for your garden. You have sent your soil off to be tested by the Ag extension office (if you are in the USA). There are a couple of things that you can plant now that are soil indifferent while you are waiting for the test results. The list includes most roots, like carrots, potatoes, turnips, radishes, and parsnips to name a few. All the roots care about is that the soil is well worked &#8211; no stones, no clumps and broken up deep. The onion family will grow almost anywhere any time. This is also true of the leafy vegetables. From lettuce to kale to spinach they all can be planted early and often. Sandy soil is the one thing that negates all that I have said so far. Because it drains fast and has few nutrients. But you  can see whether your soil is too sandy just by looking at it.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/sand.jpg" title="sand.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/sand.jpg" alt="sand.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Today I want to discuss 2 factors to keep in mind at this stage of your gardening, besides saying that you will make mistakes and nature will deal you a bad hand at times. It happens to all of us. 1. Assess your tastes. Tastes change over time and if you have never had the plant that you are growing FRESH, get fresh and try it. In my case, I had never had fresh spinach. I had grown to quickly hate the canned spinach dished out by mom and the school cafeteria, thus I thought all spinach tasted like that. Boy was I wrong! Fresh spinach rocks. I have gotten to the point where I cook with it alot too but it takes practice.</p>

<p><strong>(CBS) </strong> <!-- sphereit start--> When the editors of Taste of Home magazine asked their readers for submissions for their Garden Bounty recipe contest, they were inundated with all manner of delicious dishes, from appetizers to salads to vegetarian entrees to fruit-laden desserts.</p>
<p>After reviewing all the recipes, they found their winner: Kathryn Pehl, the third 2007 Taste of Home contest winners to appear on <em><strong>The Early Show</strong></em>. Katie hails from Prescott, Ariz., and the judges could not resist her Spaghetti Squash with Red Sauce, especially her flavorful tomato sauce, which is served over spaghetti squash instead of the usual pasta.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in participating in a Taste of Home recipe competition, the next contest is &#8220;Corn is King.&#8221; You can also still submit a recipe for Slow Cookers.

<p>2. Every &#8220;GOOD&#8221; gardener will tell you to buy plants at a greenhouse or a garden center for great production. But think about it. The main reason this Site is discussing gardening is to SAVE energy. If the greenhouse grew their plants from seed, fine. But a lot of places truck their plants in&#8230;and that is kinda missing the point. I urge people to start there plants from seed where and whenever they can:<a href="http://www.yougrowgirl.com/grow/seeds_veg.php"></a></p>

Ready to start your growing season?<br>
The much anticipated moment has arrived.</p>
<p><font size="3" color="#666633"><strong>Planning</strong></font></p>
<p>Keep the following in mind when planning your garden:</p>
<ul>
<strong>Climate:</strong> What grows well in your region?<br>
<strong>Space limitations:</strong> How extensive will your garden be?<br>
<strong>Domestic habits:</strong> What would you like to eat from your garden?<br>
<strong>Production levels:</strong> How many <a href="http://www.yougrowgirl.com/grow/tomatoes_health.php">tomatoes</a> do you really need?<br>
<strong>Aesthetic desires:</strong> How would you like the space to look?<br>
Make a list of your top ten most desired veggies.  Start with them.</ul>
<p><font size="3" color="#666633"><strong>Seed Sowing Schedule</strong></font></p>
<p>This seed starting chart will help you figure out exactly when to plant  different seeds.<br>
First, determine your region&#8217;s frost-free date.  Ask your local plant  nursery or gardener neighbor.  Alternatively, check  out&#8211;<a href="http://www.almanac.com/garden/garden.frostchart.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.almanac.com</a>.  The reality of  weather makes an `exact&#8217; date rarely exact.  Keep in mind the forecasts for  your region.  A colder, longer winter?  Push the date forward a few weeks.   As they say, better safe then sorry.</p>

<p>This early in the game you can do other things to save energy, like starting a compost pile:</p>

<p><strong>Compost heaps</strong></p>
<p class="main">There are several ways in which compost heaps can be made and various theories exist as to the way in which they should be treated. There are two important points which are essential for successful compost making and these are adequate drainage and aeration and sufficient moisture.</p>
<p class="main">A compost heap is a necessary feature in the average <a href="http://www.backyardgardener.com/compost/index.html#" itxtdid="6939730" target="_blank" style="border-bottom: 0.2em dotted #2b65b0 ! important; font-weight: normal ! important; font-size: 100% ! important; text-decoration: none ! important; padding-bottom: 0px ! important; color: #2b65b0 ! important; background-color: transparent ! important" classname="iAs" class="iAs" rel="noopener"><nobr style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 100%" id="itxt_nobr_1_0">garden<img decoding="async" src="http://images.intellitxt.com/ast/adTypes/mag-glass_10x10.gif" style="border: 0pt none ; margin: 0pt; padding: 0pt; height: 10px; width: 10px; position: relative; top: 1px; left: 1px; float: none"></nobr></a>. It provides a means of collecting the surprising amount of waste material which is gathered together during regular garden maintenance and it supplies the garden, or rather, the soil, with valuable organic matter. This organic matter fulfils several vital functions. It helps to improve the structure of the soil, especially the heavy clay types and the light sandy kinds. It encourages a vigorous root system and also acts as a sponge to retain moisture. Light, sandy soils tend to dry out rather badly and a high humus content is necessary to overcome this problem. Well-rotted composted vegetable waste can be used as a mulch around plants and between rows of vegetables where it will smother small annual weeds and prevent the surface soil from drying out badly.</p>

<a href="http://www.uk-energy-saving.com/rainwater_harvesting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Collect rainwater</strong></a> and use a watering can instead of a hose.

<li>Water your garden in the cool of the early morning or evening. This will reduce the amount of water lost to evaporation.</li>
<li>If you water plants and shrubs too often their roots will remain shallow, weakening the plant. Leave them alone until they show signs of wilting.</li>
<li>Regularly weed and hoe your garden, to ensure that watering helps plants and not weeds.</li>
<li>Plant flowers and shrubs that thrive in hot and dry conditions such as thyme, evening primrose, rock rose, Californian poppy, pinks, lavender, buddleia and hebes.</li>
<li>Mulches such as wood chips, bark and gravel help to prevent water evaporation and also suppress weed growth, saving you both water and time spent weeding.</li>
<li>Lawns can survive long periods of dry weather if the grass is not cut too short. Even if the grass turns brown, it will quickly recover after a few days of rain.</li>
<li>Garden sprinklers can use as much water in an hour as a family of four uses in a day. If you use a sprinkler, many water companies require you to have a water meter fitted.</li>

<p>For those who track their local temperatures using the Celsius scale, 40 degrees is a daunting number. In early February 2009, residents of southeastern Australia were cringing at their weather forecasts, as predictions of temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) meant that a blistering heat wave was continuing.</p>
<p>This map of Australia shows how the land surface temperature from January 25 to February 1 compared to the average mid-summer temperatures the continent experienced between 2000-2008. Places where temperatures were warmer than average are red, places experiencing near-normal temperatures are white, and places where temperatures were cooler than average are blue. The data were collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite. While southern Australia was scorching, a similarly large area of northern and central Australia was several degrees cooler than it was in the previous nine years. The cool anomaly across that region is probably linked to the <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=36660">above-average rainfall</a> the area has received during this year’s wet season.</p>
<p>Land surface temperature is how hot the surface of the Earth would feel to the touch in a particular location. From a satellite’s point of view, the “surface” is whatever it sees when it looks through the atmosphere to the ground. That could be the sand on a beach, the grass on a lawn, the roof of a building, or a paved road. Thus, daytime land surface temperature is often much higher than the air temperature that is included in the daily weather report—a fact that anyone who has walked barefoot across a parking lot on a summer afternoon could verify.</p>
<p>The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) called this heat wave “exceptional,” not only for the high temperatures but for their duration. One-day records were broken in multiple cities, with temperatures in the mid-40s. In Kyancutta, South Australia, the temperature reached 48.2 degrees Celsius (118.8 degrees Fahrenheit). Many places also set records for the number of consecutive days with record-breaking heat.</p>

<p>It will only get worse.</p>

<p>The frozen desert interior of Antarctica was thought to be the lone holdout resisting the man-made warming affecting the rest of the globe, with some areas even showing signs of cooling.</p>
<p>Some global warming contrarians liked to point to inner Antarctica as a counter-example. But climate researchers have now turned this notion on its head, with the first study to show that the <a href="http://www.livescience.com/environment/080507-models-overheat.html">entire continent</a>  is warming, and has been for the past 50 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Antarctica is warming, and it&#8217;s warming at the same rate as the rest of the planet,&#8221; said study co-author Michael Mann of Penn State University.</p>
<p>This finding, detailed in the Jan. 21 issue of the journal <em>Nature</em>, has implications for estimating ice melt and sea level rise from the continent, which is almost entirely covered by ice that averages about a mile (1.6 kilometers) thick. The revelation also undermines the common use of <a href="http://www.livescience.com/topic/antarctica">Antarctica</a>  as an argument against <a href="http://www.livescience.com/topic/global-warming">global warming</a>  by contrarians, Mann said.</p>

<h1>Summer peak,</h1>
<p>winter low temperatures now arrive 2 days earlier</p>
<p><span class="byline">By Robert Sanders, Media Relations</span> <span class="date">| 21 January 2009</span></p>
<p><span class="dateline">BERKELEY — </span>Not only has the average global temperature increased in the past 50 years, but the hottest day of the year has shifted nearly two days earlier, according to a new study by scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, and Harvard University.</p>
<p class="pixboxRight" style="width: 300px"><strong>July</strong><br>

Because the sun is further north in July, the warm bulge of high temperatures is shifted into the northern hemisphere in that month. In the Northern Hemisphere, warm temperatures extend farther north on land than over ocean in the summer and cold temperatures extend farther south on land than on the ocean in the winter. </span><span class="credit">(Image by Alexander R. Stine/UC Berkeley; data from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia )</span></p>
<p>Just as human-generated greenhouse gases appear to the be the cause of global warming, human activity may also be the cause of the shift in the cycle of seasons, according to Alexander R. Stine, a graduate student in UC Berkeley&#8217;s Department of Earth and Planetary Science and first author of the report.&#8221;We see 100 years where there is a very natural pattern of variability, and then we see a large departure from that pattern at the same time as global mean temperatures start increasing, which makes us suspect that there&#8217;s a human role here,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Although the cause of this seasonal shift &#8211; which has occurred over land, but not the ocean &#8211; is unclear, the researchers say the shift appears to be related, in part, to a particular pattern of winds that also has been changing over the same time period. This pattern of atmospheric circulation, known as the Northern Annular Mode, is the most important wind pattern for controlling why one winter in the Northern Hemisphere is different from another. The researchers found that the mode also is important in controlling the arrival of the seasons each year.</p>
<p>Whatever the cause, Stine said, current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models do not predict this phase shift in the annual temperature cycle.</p>
<p>Details are published in the Jan. 22 issue of the journal Nature.</p>

<h2 align="center">Archer Daniels Midland:   A Case Study In Corporate Welfare</h2>
<p align="center">by James Bovard</p>
<p align="center">James Bovard is an associate policy analyst with the Cato Institute. His most recent book is Shakedown: How the Government Screws You from A to Z (Viking, 1995).</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Executive Summary</strong></p>
<p>        The Archer Daniels Midland Corporation (ADM) has been         the most prominent recipient of corporate welfare in recent         U.S. history.  ADM and its chairman Dwayne Andreas have         lavishly fertilized both political parties with millions of         dollars in handouts and in return have reaped billion-dollar         windfalls from taxpayers and consumers.  Thanks to federal         protection of the domestic sugar industry, ethanol subsidies,         subsidized grain exports, and various other programs, ADM has         cost the American economy billions of dollars since 1980 and         has indirectly cost Americans tens of billions of dollars in         higher prices and higher taxes over that same period.  At         least 43 percent of ADM&#8217;s annual profits are from products         heavily subsidized or protected by the American government.         Moreover, every $1 of profits earned by ADM&#8217;s corn sweetener         operation costs consumers $10, and every $1 of profits earned         by its ethanol operation costs taxpayers $30</p>
<p>One of the most politically charged debates in Washington revolves around business subsidies known as &#8220;corporate         welfare.&#8221;  A number of policy organizations have published         studies examining the corporate welfare phenomenon: what         qualifies as corporate welfare, how much it costs taxpayers,         and how much it damages the economy.  This study examines the         dynamics of corporate welfare somewhat differently by investigating ADM as a classic case study of how those subsidies         are obtained, how the welfare state encourages such &#8220;rent         seeking,&#8221; and how such practices fundamentally corrupt the         political life of a nation.  Congress&#8217;s expressed desire to         foster a free marketplace cannot be taken seriously until         ADM&#8217;s corporate hand is removed from the federal till.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>ADM is certainly the nation&#8217;s most arrogant welfare recipient. And it is one of the few welfare recipients that spend millions of dollars each year advertising on Sunday morning television shows populated and watched by politicians. Chairman Dwayne Andreas&#8217;s and ADM&#8217;s success in farming Washington represents the rational result of contemporary government policies that turn elections into &#8220;an advanced auction of stolen goods,&#8221; as H. L. Mencken quipped. Thanks to its multi-million-dollar hustling in Washington, a company that lives and dies on the generosity of the American taxpayer has managed to get itself revered as a great public servant. Although ADM is not the only corporation with its hand out in Washington, it is easily one of the most successful beggars on the block.(1)</p>
<p>Andreas recently told a reporter for Mother Jones, &#8220;There isn&#8217;t one grain of anything in the world that is sold in a free market. Not one! The only place you see a free market is in the speeches of politicians. People who are not in the Midwest do not understand that this is a socialist country.&#8221;(2) Andreas&#8217;s comment about &#8220;no free markets&#8221; is like the old joke about the son who murdered his parents and then asked for the court&#8217;s mercy because he was an orphan. ADM champions political control over markets and then invokes that control as an excuse for its continued political manipulation. Andreas has exerted his influence in Washington to ensure that the U.S. form of &#8220;socialism&#8221; resembles 1930s&#8217; Italian corporate statism: the government plunders the citizenry for the benefit of politically connected corporations. And, though Andreas does not like to admit it, there are many markets in the world for agricultural products that are not controlled by politicians.</p>

			<p>I predicted this almost a year ago. BUT be prepared. By next summer oil will be back up in the 100$$ range probably topping out 132$$ per barrel. Why? Because this commodity market have never been destabilized by speculators before and it will BOUNCE around. Back and forth. Back and forth. Until it settles down where it started and where the Saudi&#8217;s say it should be at 70$$ per barrel. Will we survive all that whipsawing? Probably not. By then maybe we will be off the damn stuff and no one will care.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em">Local Book Review by John Arthur Marshall, (JAMinfo@AOL.com); President<br>
Arthur R. Marshall Foundation and Florida Environmental Institute, Inc. www.ArtMarshall.org</p>
<p>A Contract with the Earth: Newt Gingrich and Terry Maple; John Hopkins; 2007</p>
<p>Contract with the Earth is an overdue call for local, national and international action in a time of serious need for we planetary occupants to pay much more attention to what we are doing to the planet (destroying our life support system at a seemingly indiscernible rate, with enormous consequences given ubiquitous inaction). This is the major problem that Contract addresses.</p>
<p>Contract might be summarized as a re-call of Teddy Roosevelt conservationism with emphasis on the authors&#8217; new advocacy of entrepreneurial environmentalism. All this verges on a matter of insistence, which is good, even great, if twice as many folks that are engaged in the present environmental movement read and heed&#8230; Then engage at least one neo-conservationist politician on the need to take on stewardship of the environment as a major issue in the current election debates. We can do it!</p>
<p>As the authors astutely note: Everyone ought to participate in discussions of environmental policies and to that end should have a rudimentary understanding of the processes that make a habitable planet.</p>
<p>Of particular importance in the current elections scenario, the authors identify the need to get the environment elevated as arguably the most important issue confronting society today. How can presidential candidates not pay attention to long-term effects of climate change, and the need for conservation and preservation of what remains of our life support system? A bonus is a call for strategic planning, and adherence to planetary needs.</p>
<p>The authors acknowledge that insufficient attention is being paid by politicians, and with the rest of us, lament that the current administration has been a failure here, even with the late attempt at for lasting legacy to cover inaction regarding potential disastrous consequences in the future.</p>
<p>The author&#8217;s define the distinction between conservation and preservation in a manner that deserves further consideration. That is left for future readers to discover, in a book that is worth reading, and begging for action by the non-reactive information-overloaded majority.</p>
<p>As President of a tree-planting organization, my most favorite spot in this book is Chapter 8: Renewing the Natural World. This chapter emphasizes the need to preserve rainforests and restore forests and wetlands. Here in Florida we call them forested wetlands, or swamps (lots of cypress and custard apple trees and related species normally in standing water). In the sequence of quotable quotes at the beginning of each chapter, Chapter 8 also holds my favorite quote:</p>
<p>Few are altogether deaf to the preaching of pine trees. Their sermons on the mountains go to our hearts; and if people in general could be got into the woods, even for once to hear the trees speak for themselves, all difficulties in the way of forest perseveration would vanish. John Muir [Founder Sierra Club]; there were also lots of pine trees in Florida. The past-tense is not good.</p>
<p>This quote is an appropriate sequel to another salient section in Chapter 10, with the mention of Richard Louv, author of Last Child in the Woods. Louv amplifies the need for the younger generation to be more exposed to nature, as previous generations were. Something is missing. Louv points out that staying indoors in front of a computer, rather than more exposure to nature, may lead to nature deficit disorder, which he relates to potential attention deficit disorder and maladjustments in life.</p>
<p>As a sixth generation Floridian, following progress of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) I very much appreciate Newt&#8217;s observation on page 226:</p>
<p>&#8220;Florida has the opportunity to become a laboratory that the entire world studies&#8230; There are very few places where you have a complex fragile ecosystem this close to this many people&#8221;. Newt, Associated Press, 1997. Recent AP headlines &#8211; Everglades Restoration bogged down &#8211; is inappropriate.</p>
<p>The authors also recognize that the proximity of massive land-fills (Mt. Trashmore&#8217;s we call them) to the Everglades are inappropriate to conservation and preservation of important ecosystems. Currently, local government is considering locating a Mt. Trashmore right next to the Arthur R. Marshall National Wildlife Refuge, a primary subject of CERP implementation. Not only will the landfill be a dominant terrain feature, the creatures this will attract will pose a serious threat to native wildlife, especially wading birds. This could also pose a serious threat to federal funding.</p>
<p>The authors also implore us (again!) to think globally and act locally. OK Palm Beachers, CERP implementation is also about sustaining a viable water supply. This is need to know stuff.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the behavior of government toward CERP, especially in the current federal administration, is much like the authors describe:</p>
<p>The American government, however continues to posture and vent, unable or unwilling to commit or act decisively&#8230;. Except possibly to give development overwhelming priority.</p>
<p>If there is one thing that might call for a little reconsideration, it is the authors&#8217; inclination to view technological solutions as sometimes preferable to natural one&#8217;s, without mentioning the precautionary principle, an approach advocated by scientists when there is a dearth of knowledge. Scientists caution on reliance of engineered solutions, as there are always unforeseen, usually adverse consequences here. Humankind&#8217;s intrusions require natural solutions. Natural solutions are most often perpetual, and the most cost-effective. OK, green energy may be an exception.</p>
<p>At the onset, Contract challenges the readers to take a Test to determine whether (or not) you (the reader) is a mainstream environmentalist. In the end the authors challenge the readers to support the broad principles of the contract, by contributing time and ideas to create together a new kind of environmental movement.</p>
<p>From the Everglades Restoration endeavor, a more widely applicable quote is attributed to the Mother of the Everglades, Marjory Stoneman Douglas, author of Everglades, River of Grass:</p>
<p>If we pass the Test we get to keep the planet!</p>

<p>Scientist Fred Bortz sees it a little different:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fredbortz.com/review/ContractWithEarth.htm">http://www.fredbortz.com/review/ContractWithEarth.htm</a></p>
<p>I am a scientist, and I vote. To put this review in context, I place myself in the moderate to progressive segment of American politics. But I never let my political views get in the way of interpreting what observation, experiment, and scientific analysis tell me about the world.</p>
<p>For instance, when I reviewed Chris Mooney&#8217;s provocative <em>The Republican War on Science</em> (<em>RWOS</em>), my first reaction was skepticism. &#8220;Show me the evidence,&#8221; I demanded of that book. In the end, Mooney&#8217;s thorough research persuaded me that his thesis deserved serious consideration.</p>
<p><em>RWOS</em> covered a broad range of topics, but the one of greatest concern to me was the political foot-dragging and outright denial of human-induced global warming, especially in the Republican controlled congress and the George W. Bush White House.</p>
<p>I often wrote in <a href="http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/blog/fred_bortz">my blog</a> that I would listen to any proposed political solution to the problem&#8211;liberal, conservative, or otherwise&#8211;as long as the discussion began with the best understanding of the science and considered a range of plausible scenarios. Thus I was heartened to learn of this new book by one of the United States leading conservative thinkers, Newt Gingrich, in collaboration with conservationist Terry Maple.</p>
<p>I assumed that I would disagree with Gingrich&#8217;s proposed political approaches. But I also assumed that the book will make an important contribution to the debate on global warming. I was correct on both counts. <em>A Contract With the Earth</em> has the potential to move the debate away from whether global warming is occurring and whether human activities are causing it, and move toward issues where conservatives and liberals argue about how best to deal with the problem.</p>
<p>However, I am disappointed that it pussyfoots around the Right&#8217;s nonsense about calling global warming a hoax and a liberal conspiracy. Gingrich frequently points fingers at the Left for their &#8220;doomsday scenarios.&#8221; I disagree with that characterization, though I understand that a warning can be delivered too stridently, thereby turning off the people you hope to reach.</p>
<p>But if turning people away from the solution is a problem, then Gingrich needs to be equally critical of outright denialism on the Right. To deny and obfuscate is far more than simply to &#8220;disdain&#8221; environmental action, which is about as far as he goes in criticizing his own party. He may not have agreed with leading denier Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, but by remaining quiet he facilitated Inhofe&#8217;s misuse of his Chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works to block action on global warming. In this book, Gingrich is continuing to give Inhofe and his cronies a pass.</p>
<p>In other words, I don&#8217;t doubt his sincerity about the need to act, and I don&#8217;t question the value of conservative approaches to the solution. But Gingrich is clearly worried about his right flank in this book. Mainstream Republicans have known for some time that global warming is a problem and would welcome some courageous leadership from Gingrich. Instead, many of them will see this as opportunism by someone who wants to be president and thus can&#8217;t afford to alienate the Right.</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px">Green Republicans</h3>
<p>A review by Juliet Eilperin</p>
<p>Yet they gloss over some of the toughest questions facing international policymakers today, and they compare the environmental records of Bush and former President Bill Clinton in a way that strains credulity.  </p>
<p>On the central question of global warming, Gingrich and Maple are closer to Bush than to most of the world&#8217;s business and political leaders. They argue that climate change poses a serious threat and that the United States should reengage in international negotiations. But they question the wisdom of imposing a mandatory, nationwide cap on carbon emissions on the grounds that Europe&#8217;s carbon dioxide emissions rose faster than America&#8217;s between 2000 and 2004. (It&#8217;s worth noting that since 2000, U.S. emissions have risen at 1.5 times the rate they did in the 1990s, not exactly a stunning model of restraint.) Like Bush, Gingrich and Maple rest their hopes on technological innovation: &#8220;The world can be changed faster by the spread of brilliant ideas than by any plodding bureaucracy, and we gladly put our faith in such intellectual and social processes.&#8221;</p>
<p>In that sense this book is classic Newt, brimming with military metaphors and grand visions of America leading the rest of globe to a brighter future. In environmentalism, as in war, &#8220;we must demand a complete and decisive victory,&#8221; the authors say. &#8220;Renewing the earth is surely one of the greatest challenges this generation has confronted, and we understand how important it is to succeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>To show the value of what they call &#8220;business partnerships on behalf of the environment,&#8221; the authors describe how the Nature Conservancy, Conservation International and the Wildlife Conservation Society have made common cause with such corporate entities as Wal-Mart and McDonald&#8217;s. As a result, much of the book reads like the kind of corporate advertisement that appears on newspaper op-ed pages. Gingrich and Maple contend that the private sector, not government, holds the answers to the globe&#8217;s biggest problems. The question is whether people in places such as Bangladesh can afford to wait and see if they&#8217;re right.</p>

			<p>I never thought I would be citing Kathryn Rem at the SJ-R for an environmental article. Don&#8217;t get me wrong she is a dandy writer, in the same league with Tim Landis (whom I regularly &#8220;borrow from&#8221;), but she usually writes a food column. I read it faithfully because I am a minor foodie, and she usually has cool things to say. In her <strong>Seeing Red About Green</strong>, she broke a story that I might have missed. Thanks Ms. Rem!</p>

<p><strong>Mintel International</strong> in Chicago coined the term “Never Green” to describe 10 percent of the shopper universe. A second study by <strong>The Shelton Group </strong>of Knoxville, Tenn., found that 26 percent of respondents were “hardcore skeptics,” mostly upper middle-class, conservative, middle-aged men.</p>
<p> reporter <strong>Jim Edwards</strong> profiles <strong>William Coverley</strong>, a retired investment banker from Ohio, who just bought his 10th vehicle, a 2008 <strong>GMC Yukon</strong> XL that gets 14 miles per gallon.</p>
<p>“I don’t care about the environmental reasons and I’ll tell you why,” Coverley said. “All this stuff about carbon emissions, no one really knows about the output of the sun and yet it’s the single most important input behind global warming . . . Are the Chinese going to be environmentalists? Are the Indians going to be environmentalists? Are the Russians? I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>Edwards suggests studying your market carefully before launching green marketing, because emphasizing environmental claims may cost you the business of people like Coverley or Washington accountant <strong>Sally Herigstad</strong>. She bought organic produce by mistake at <strong>Fred Meyer</strong> and was dismayed to discover a recently deceased two-inch caterpillar in her steamed broccoli.</p>
<p>Shelton Group CEO <strong>Suzanne Shelton</strong> found that 46 percent of respondents felt “guilty, skeptical, irritated or unaffected by green issues,” and the same percentage put their comfort ahead of convenience and environmental concerns. The study was commissioned by Shelton Group client <strong>BP Solar</strong>.</p>

			<p>People have been brainwashed to believe that our world will come to a crashing end without oil. The Peak Oil people in particular have a saying &#8220;back to the olduvai valley&#8221; because they believe that our civilization will crumble like the Egyptions, Greeks and other GREAT civilizations. Olduvai was the valley where they found the homonid Lucy&#8217;s bones.</p>
<p>Admittedly some of those societal &#8220;downs&#8221; caused famine and pestilence, but in others it merely led to lots of people going back to farming. As silly as it may sound, you can generate electricity with a bicycle and charge a battery to run a computer. Us modern humans have run on excess energy  for so long it might not hurt us or the planet to take a break and set some priorities.</p>
<p>So anyway from where I live in Riverton IL in the USA, I would just go back to farming and let a few yard birds run. Others are not so lucky. I have said with no malice or cruelty that a lot of people are going to die. But I think we will do what humanity has done for 1000&#8217;s of years&#8230;we hang together.</p>

<h2 id="article-header-h2">Farming without fossils</h2>
<p>In a world on the cusp of fuel shortages, one enterprising collection of British farmers have come up with a solution they claim is practical, profitable – and close to home. They’re growing their own. <strong>Trevor Lawson</strong> reports</p>
<p>Barton reckons that the Goodwood estate’s tenant farmers could produce enough biofuel to supply the estate and themselves, and still have a surplus for sale. The key, he argues, is keep it local. “There’s no point in producing seed here, sending it miles for processing and then bringing the fuel all the way back. It’s too inefficient.” So Barton is looking at a combined rape press and refinery system that will produce 2,000 litres of fuel an hour, round the clock, for as long as there is rape seed to supply it. He’s also got plans for the pressed ‘cake’ that’s left over. “You can make it into dense briquettes for a superb solid fuel, burning more slowly than wood but at a higher temperature. So it can be used to feed boilers to generate heat and electricity.” Barton’s logic seems inescapable, and it’s finding allies in Whitehall, too. Nick Cooper manages the Farming Without Fossil Fuels project at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>

<p><strong>Peak Oil: the threat to our food security<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Peak oil refers to the point when the maximum amount of oil that can be extracted globally is reached. Thereafter, production will tail off as remaining reserves become more difficult and more expensive to harvest. Many of the services that we currently take for granted &#8211; cheap flights, cheap imports and global distribution of food &#8211; will be radically curtailed.<br>
 One of the greatest impacts will be on how and where our food is produced. The dominant models of intensive agriculture and the global food trade depend on vast inputs of oil. In a post peak oil world, the combination of higher transport costs, climate change and increased conflict will necessitate us all relying far more on re-localised food supplies. Even though it requires far lower amounts of oil, organic farming is not exempt from the need to adapt.</p>
<p>You can find out more in our information sheets on <a href="http://www.peakoil.com/">peak oil</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_and_agriculture">climate change and agriculture</a>.</p>
<p>Over the last 20 years, the Soil Association has established organic farming as the most sustainable method of production and helped grow a burgeoning market for organic food. Now we must refine our focus if we are to adapt to the changing external circumstances which will touch all our lives very soon. The phrase that comes to mind is that we are &#8216;building the ark of sustainable agriculture&#8217; for the new era ahead.</p>
<p>The challenge is immediate, but fear should not be the driver. The Soil Association is optimistic that we have the vision and means to create a new, localised food culture that will deliver long-term quality of life in place of the old dynamic of unrestrained globalisation and short-termist exploitation.</p>

<h3>Applying Energy Descent Plans to Food and Farming &#8211; an article in Living Earth magazine.</h3>
<p><a href="http://transitionculture.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/samag1.jpg" title="samag1"><img decoding="async" src="http://transitionculture.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/samag1.thumbnail.jpg" alt="samag1" title="samag1" class="inthepageright"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.soilassociation.org/web/sa/saweb.nsf/home/index.html" title="SA"><font color="#b5b380">The Soil Association</font></a> is the UK’s organic certification body, and they are making peak oil and the relocalisation of food the focal point of their 60th Anniversary conference in Cardiff in February. I am editing a report that will accompany the conference, which explores this deeper, and to introduce this, I recently wrote an article that appears in <a href="http://www.soilassociation.org/web/sa/saweb.nsf/Living/le_extra.html" title="LE"><font color="#b5b380">Living Earth Magazine</font></a>, the organisation’s publication. It suggests that the concept of Energy Descent Plans could be applied to food and farming in the UK, an idea that will be explored in more depth in the report. Here is the article followed by some additions from within the Soil Association.<span id="more-564"></span></p>
<p><strong>Energy scarcity is an opportunity for a better world, says Rob Hopkins</strong></p>
<p>I used to think that one day the world would literally run out of oil. A driver in Leicestershire would use the last drop and that would be that, similar to the felling of the last Truffula Tree in Dr Seuss’s The Lorax. It turns out that scarcity kicks in earlier than that. It’s not the last drop that is the problem but the mid-point of production, when all the oil that is easy and cheap to extract has been used up. It looks as if we are reaching that point soon.</p>

<p>Where folks have &#8220;farmable&#8221; or &#8220;growable&#8221; land, all of us will have to plant Victory Gardens and raise rabbits and chickens. We will have to buy and sell local. For those that do not&#8230; well that is something we all should be planning for now. There are probably 2 billion people in harms way. What about the economy? Well what about it? Aren&#8217;t WE the economy. Money may be worrthless&#8230;but so what. That is only gona matter to people that gots a lot of it.</p>

			<p>Let&#8217;s look at the food and energy issue another way. I spend most of my time talking to people about how to use less energy in their homes. But, according to Dale Allen Phieffer I can save much more on food than in my house or my car.</p>

<blockquote><p>The secret of great wealth with no obvious source is some forgotten crime, forgotten because it was done neatly.—Balzac</p></blockquote>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The journalist&#8217;s rule says: follow the money. </font></p>
<p><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This rule, however, is not really axiomatic but derivative, in that money, as even our vice president will tell you, is really a way of tracking energy. We&#8217;ll follow the energy.</font><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We learn as children that there is no free lunch, that you don&#8217;t get something from nothing, that what goes up must come down, and so on. The scientific version of these verities is only slightly more complex. As James Prescott Joule discovered in the nineteenth century, there is only so much energy. You can change it from motion to heat, from heat to light, but there will never be more of it and there will never be less of it. The conservation of energy is not an option, it is a fact. This is the first law of thermodynamics.</font><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Special as we humans are, we get no exemptions from the rules. All animals eat plants or eat animals that eat plants. This is the food chain, and pulling it is the unique ability of plants to turn sunlight into stored energy in the form of carbohydrates, the basic fuel of all animals. Solar-powered photosynthesis is the only way to make this fuel. There is no alternative to plant energy, just as there is no alternative to oxygen. The results of taking away our plant energy may not be as sudden as cutting off oxygen, but they are as sure.</font><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scientists have a name for the total amount of plant mass created by Earth in a given year, the total budget for life. They call it the planet&#8217;s &#8220;primary productivity.&#8221; There have been two efforts to figure out how that productivity is spent, one by a group at Stanford University, the other an independent accounting by the biologist Stuart Pimm. Both conclude that we humans, a single species among millions, consume about 40 percent of Earth&#8217;s primary productivity, 40 percent of all there is. This simple number may explain why the current extinction rate is 1,000 times that which existed before human domination of the planet. We 6 billion have simply stolen the food, the rich among us a lot more than others.</font><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Energy cannot be created or canceled, but it can be concentrated. This is the larger and profoundly explanatory context of a national-security memo George Kennan wrote in 1948 as the head of a State Department planning committee, ostensibly about Asian policy but really about how the United States was to deal with its newfound role as the dominant force on Earth. &#8220;We have about 50 percent of the world&#8217;s wealth but only 6.3 percent of its population,&#8221; Kennan wrote. &#8220;In this situation, we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment. Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity without positive detriment to our national security. To do so, we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day-dreaming; and our attention will have to be concentrated everywhere on our immediate national objectives. We need not deceive ourselves that we can afford today the luxury of altruism and world-benefaction.&#8221;</font><font size="+1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;The day is not far off,&#8221; Kennan concluded, &#8220;when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts.&#8221;</font></p>
<p>If you follow the energy, eventually you will end up in a field somewhere. Humans engage in a dizzying array of artifice and industry. Nonetheless, more than two thirds of humanity&#8217;s cut of primary productivity results from agriculture, two thirds of which in turn consists of three plants: rice, wheat, and corn. In the 10,000 years since humans domesticated these rains, their status has remained undiminished, most likely because they are able to store solar energy in uniquely dense, transportable bundles of carbohydrates. They are to the plant world what a barrel of refined oil is to the hydrocarbon world. Indeed, aside from hydrocarbons they are the most concentrated form of true wealth&#8211;sun energy&#8211;to be found on the planet.</p>
<p>As Kennan recognized, however, the maintenance of such a concentration of wealth often requires violent action. Agriculture is a recent human experiment. For most of human history, we lived by gathering or killing a broad variety of nature&#8217;s offerings. Why humans might have traded this approach for the complexities of agriculture is an interesting and long-debated question, especially because the skeletal evidence clearly indicates that early farmers were more poorly nourished, more disease-ridden and deformed, than their hunter-gatherer contemporaries. Farming did not improve most lives. The evidence that best points to the answer, I think, lies in the difference between early agricultural villages and their pre-agricultural counterparts&#8211;the presence not just of grain but of granaries and, more tellingly, of just a few houses significantly larger and more ornate than all the others attached to those granaries. Agriculture was not so much about food as it was about the accumulation of wealth. It benefited some humans, and those people have been in charge ever since.</p>
<p>Domestication was also a radical change in the distribution of wealth within the plant world. Plants can spend their solar income in several ways. The dominant and prudent strategy is to allocate most of it to building roots, stem, bark&#8211;a conservative portfolio of investments that allows the plant to better gather energy and survive the downturn years. Further, by living in diverse stands (a given chunk of native prairie contains maybe 200 species of plants), these perennials provide services for one another, such as retaining water, protecting one another from wind, and fixing free nitrogen from the air to use as fertilizer. Diversity allows a system to &#8220;sponsor its own fertility,&#8221; to use visionary agronomist Wes Jackson&#8217;s phrase. This is the plant world&#8217;s norm.</p>
<p>There is a very narrow group of annuals, however, that grow in patches of a single species and store almost all of their income as seed, a tight bundle of carbohydrates easily exploited by seed eaters such as ourselves. Under normal circumstances, this eggs-in-one-basket strategy is a dumb idea for a plant. But not during catastrophes such as floods, fires, and volcanic eruptions. Such catastrophes strip established plant communities and create opportunities for wind-scattered entrepreneurial seed bearers. It is no accident that no matter where agriculture sprouted on the globe, it always happened near rivers. You might assume, as many have, that this is because the plants needed the water or nutrients. Mostly this is not true. They needed the power of flooding, which scoured landscapes and stripped out competitors. Nor is it an accident, I think, that agriculture arose independently and simultaneously around the globe just as the last ice age ended, a time of enormous upheaval when glacial melt let loose sea-size lakes to create tidal waves of erosion. It was a time of catastrophe.</p>
<p>Corn, rice, and wheat are especially adapted to catastrophe. It is their niche. In the natural scheme of things, a catastrophe would create a blank slate, bare soil, that was good for them. Then, under normal circumstances, succession would quickly close that niche. The annuals would colonize. Their roots would stabilize the soil, accumulate organic matter, provide cover. Eventually the catastrophic niche would close. Farming is the process of ripping that niche open again and again. It is an annual artificial catastrophe, and it requires the equivalent of three or four tons of TNT per acre for a modern American farm. Iowa&#8217;s fields require the energy of 4,000 Nagasaki bombs every year.</p>
<p>Iowa is almost all fields now. Little prairie remains, and if you can find what Iowans call a &#8220;postage stamp&#8221; remnant of some, it most likely will abut a cornfield. This allows an observation. Walk from the prairie to the field, and you probably will step down about six feet, as if the land had been stolen from beneath you. Settlers&#8217; accounts of the prairie conquest mention a sound, a series of pops, like pistol shots, the sound of stout grass roots breaking before a moldboard plow. A robbery was in progress.</p>
<p>When we say the soil is rich, it is not a metaphor. It is as rich in energy as an oil well. A prairie converts that energy to flowers and roots and stems, which in turn pass back into the ground as dead organic matter. The layers of topsoil build up into a rich repository of energy, a bank. A farm field appropriates that energy, puts it into seeds we can eat. Much of the energy moves from the earth to the rings of fat around our necks and waists. And much of the energy is simply wasted, a trail of dollars billowing from the burglar&#8217;s satchel.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already mentioned that we humans take 40 percent of the globe&#8217;s primary productivity every year. You might have assumed we and our livestock eat our way through that volume, but this is not the case. Part of that total&#8211;almost a third of it&#8211;is the potential plant mass lost when forests are cleared for farming or when tropical rain forests are cut for grazing or when plows destroy the deep mat of prairie roots that held the whole business together, triggering erosion. The Dust Bowl was no accident of nature. A functioning grassland prairie produces more biomass each year than does even the most technologically advanced wheat field. The problem is, it&#8217;s mostly a form of grass and grass roots that humans can&#8217;t eat. So we replace the prairie with our own preferred grass, wheat. Never mind that we feed most of our grain to livestock, and that livestock is perfectly content to eat native grass. And never mind that there likely were more bison produced naturally on the Great Plains before farming than all of beef farming raises in the same area today. Our ancestors found it preferable to pluck the energy from the ground and when it ran out move on.</p>
<p>Today we do the same, only now when the vault is empty we fill it again with new energy in the form of oil-rich fertilizers. Oil is annual primary productivity stored as hydrocarbons, a trust fund of sorts, built up over many thousands of years. On average, it takes 5.5 gallons of fossil energy to restore a year&#8217;s worth of lost fertility to an acre of eroded land&#8211;in 1997 we burned through more than 400 years&#8217; worth of ancient fossilized productivity, most of it from someplace else. Even as the earth beneath Iowa shrinks, it is being globalized.</p>
<p>Six thousand years before sodbusters broke up Iowa, their Caucasian blood ancestors broke up the Hungarian plain, an area just northwest of the Caucasus Mountains. Archaeologists call this tribe the LBK, short for linearbandkeramik, the German word that describes the distinctive pottery remnants that mark their occupation of Europe. Anthropologists call them the wheat-beef people, a name that better connects those ancients along the Danube to my fellow Montanans on the Upper Missouri River. These proto-Europeans had a full set of domesticated plants and animals, but wheat and beef dominated. All the domesticates came from an area along what is now the Iraq-Syria-Turkey border at the edges of the Zagros Mountains. This is the center of domestication for the Western world&#8217;s main crops and live stock, ground zero of catastrophic agriculture.</p>
<p>Two other types of catastrophic agriculture evolved at roughly the same time, one centered on rice in what is now China and India and one centered on corn and potatoes in Central and South America. Rice, though, is tropical and its expansion depends on water, so it developed only in floodplains, estuaries, and swamps. Corn agriculture was every bit as voracious as wheat; the Aztecs could be as brutal and imperialistic as Romans or Brits, but the corn cultures collapsed with the onslaught of Spanish conquest. Corn itself simply joined the wheat-beef people&#8217;s coalition. Wheat was the empire builder; its bare botanical facts dictated the motion and violence that we know as imperialism.</p>
<p>The wheat-beef people swept across the western European plains in less than 300 years, a conquest some archaeologists refer to as a &#8220;blitzkrieg.&#8221; A different race of humans, the Cro-Magnons&#8211;hunter-gatherers, not farmers&#8211;lived on those plains at the time. Their cave art at places such as Lascaux testifies to their sophistication and profound connection to wildlife. They probably did most of their hunting and gathering in uplandsand river bottoms, places the wheat farmers didn&#8217;t need, suggesting the possibility of coexistence. That&#8217;s not what happened, however. Both genetic and linguistic evidence say that the farmers killed the hunters. The Basque people are probably the lone remnant descendants of Cro-Magnons, the only trace.</p>
<p>Hunter-gatherer archaeological sites of the period contain spear points that originally belonged to the farmers, and we can guess they weren&#8217;t trade goods. One group of anthropologists concludes, &#8220;The evidence from the western extension of the LBK leaves little room for any other conclusion but that LBK-Mesolithic interactions were at best chilly and at worst hostile.&#8221; The world&#8217;s surviving Blackfeet, Assiniboine Sioux, Inca, and Maori probably have the best idea of the nature of these interactions.</p>
<p>Wheat is temperate and prefers plowed-up grasslands. The globe has a limited stock of temperate grasslands, just as it has a limited stock of all other biomes. On average, about 10 percent of all other biomes remain in something like their native state today. Only 1 percent of temperate grasslands remains undestroyed. Wheat takes what it needs.</p>
<p>The supply of temperate grasslands lies in what are today the United States, Canada, the South American pampas, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Europe, and the Asiatic extension of the European plain into the sub-Siberian steppes. This area largely describes the First World, the developed world. Temperate grasslands make up not only the habitat of wheat and beef but also the globe&#8217;s islands of Caucasians, of European surnames and languages. In 2000 the countries of the temperate grasslands, the neo-Europes, accounted for about 80 percent of all wheat exports in the world, and about 86 percent of all com. That is to say, the neo-Europes drive the world&#8217;s agriculture. The dominance does not stop with grain. These countries, plus the mothership&#8211;Europe accounted for three fourths of all agricultural exports of all crops in the world in 1999.</p>
<p>Plato wrote of his country&#8217;s farmlands:</p>
<p>What now remains of the formerly rich land is like the skeleton of a sick man. &#8230;Formerly, many of the mountains were arable, The plains that were full of rich soil are now marshes. Hills that were once covered with forests and produced abundant pasture now produce only food for bees. Once the land was enriched by yearly rains, which were not lost, as they are now, by flowing from the bare land into the sea. The soil was deep, it absorbed and kept the water in loamy soil, and the water that soaked into the hills fed springs and running streams everywhere. Now the abandoned shrines at spots where formerly there were springs attest that our description of the land is true.</p>
<p>Plato&#8217;s lament is rooted in wheat agriculture, which depleted his country&#8217;s soil and subsequently caused the series of declines that pushed centers of civilization to Rome, Turkey, and western Europe. By the fifth century, though, wheat&#8217;s strategy of depleting and moving on ran up against the Atlantic Ocean. Fenced-in wheat agriculture is like rice agriculture. It balances its equations with famine. In the millennium between 500 and 1500, Britain suffered a major &#8220;corrective&#8221; famine about every ten years; there were seventy-five in France during the same period. The incidence, however, dropped sharply when colonization brought an influx of new food to Europe.</p>
<p>The new lands had an even greater effect on the colonists themselves. Thomas Jefferson, after enduring a lecture on the rustic nature by his hosts at a dinner party in Paris, pointed out that all of the Americans present were a good head taller than all of the French. Indeed, colonists in all of the neo-Europes enjoyed greater stature and longevity, as well as a lower infant-mortality rate&#8211;all indicators of the better nutrition afforded by the onetime spend down of the accumulated capital of virgin soil.</p>
<p>The precolonial famines of Europe raised the question: What would happen when the planet&#8217;s supply of arable land ran out? We have a clear answer. In about 1960 expansion hit its limits and the supply of unfarmed, arable lands came to an end. There was nothing left to plow. What happened was grain yields tripled.</p>
<p>The accepted term for this strange turn of events is the green revolution, though it would be more properly labeled the amber revolution, because it applied exclusively to grain&#8211;wheat, rice, and corn. Plant breeders tinkered with the architecture of these three grains so that they could be hypercharged with irrigation water and chemical fertilizers, especially nitrogen. This innovation meshed nicely with the increased &#8220;efficiency&#8221; of the industrialized factory-farm system. With the possible exception of the domestication of wheat, the green revolution is the worst thing that has ever happened to the planet.</p>
<p>For openers, it disrupted long-standing patterns of rural life worldwide, moving a lot of no-longer-needed people off the land and into the world&#8217;s most severe poverty. The experience in population control in the developing world is by now clear: It is not that people make more people so much as it is that they make more poor people. In the forty-year period beginning about 1960, the world&#8217;s population doubled, adding virtually the entire increase of 3 billion to the world&#8217;s poorest classes, the most fecund classes. The way in which the green revolution raised that grain contributed hugely to the population boom, and it is the weight of the population that leaves humanity in its present untenable position.</p>
<p>Discussion of these, the most poor, however, is largely irrelevant to the American situation. We say we have poor people here, but almost no one in this country lives on less than one dollar a day, the global benchmark for poverty. It marks off a class of about 1.3 billion people, the hard core of the larger group of 2 billion chronically malnourished people&#8211;that is, one third of humanity. We may forget about them, as most Americans do.</p>
<p>More relevant here are the methods of the green revolution, which added orders of magnitude to the devastation. By mining the iron for tractors, drilling the new oil to fuel them and to make nitrogen fertilizers, and by taking the water that rain and rivers had meant for other lands, farming had extended its boundaries, its dominion, to lands that were not farmable. At the same time, it extended its boundaries across time, tapping fossil energy, stripping past assets.</p>
<p>The common assumption these days is that we muster our weapons to secure oil, not food. There&#8217;s a little joke in this. Ever since we ran out of arable land, food is oil. Every single calorie we eat is backed by at least a calorie of oil, more like ten. In 1940 the average farm in the United States produced 2.3 calories of food energy for every calorie of fossil energy it used. By 1974 (the last year in which anyone looked closely at this issue), that ratio was 1:1. And this understates the problem, because at the same time that there is more oil in our food there is less oil in our oil. A couple of generations ago we spent a lot less energy drilling, pumping, and distributing than we do now. In the 1940s we got about 100 barrels of oil back for every barrel of oil we spent getting it. Today each barrel invested in the process returns only ten, a calculation that no doubt fails to include the fuel burned by the Hummers and Blackhawks we use to maintain access to the oil in Iraq.</p>
<p>David Pimentel, an expert on food and energy at Cornell University, has estimated that if all of the world ate the way the United States eats, humanity would exhaust all known global fossil-fuel reserves in just over seven years. Pimentel has his detractors. Some have accused him of being off on other calculations by as much as 30 percent. Fine. Make it ten years.</p>
<p>Fertilizer makes a pretty fine bomb right off the shelf, a chemistry lesson Timothy McVeigh taught at Oklahoma City&#8217;s Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in 1995&#8211;not a small matter, in that the green revolution has made nitrogen fertilizers ubiquitous in some of the more violent and desperate corners of the world. Still, there is more to contemplate in nitrogen&#8217;s less sensational chemistry.</p>
<p>The chemophobia of modem times excludes fear of the simple elements of chemistry&#8217;s periodic table. We circulate petitions, hold hearings, launch websites, and buy and sell legislators in regard to polysyllabic organic compounds&#8211;polychlorinated biphenyls, polyvinyls, DDT, 2-4d, that sort of thing&#8211;not simple carbon or nitrogen. Not that agriculture&#8217;s use of the more ornate chemistry is benign&#8211;an infant born in a rural, wheat-producing county in the United States has about twice the chance of suffering birth defects as one born in a rural place that doesn&#8217;t produce wheat, an effect researchers blame on chlorophenoxy herbicides. Focusing on pesticide pollution, though, misses the worst of the pollutants. Forget the polysyllabic organics. It is nitrogen-the wellspring of fertility relied upon by every Eden-obsessed backyard gardener and suburban groundskeeper&#8211;that we should fear most.</p>
<p>Those who model our planet as an organism do so on the basis that the earth appears to breathe&#8211;it thrives by converting a short list of basic elements from one compound into the next, just as our own bodies cycle oxygen into carbon dioxide and plants cycle carbon dioxide into oxygen. In fact, two of the planet&#8217;s most fundamental humors are oxygen and carbon dioxide. Another is nitrogen.</p>
<p>Nitrogen can be released from its &#8220;fixed&#8221; state as a solid in the soil by natural processes that allow it to circulate freely in the atmosphere. This also can be done artificially. Indeed, humans now contribute more nitrogen to the nitrogen cycle than the planet itself does. That is, humans have doubled the amount of nitrogen in play.</p>
<p>This has led to an imbalance. It is easier to create nitrogen fertilizer than it is to apply it evenly to fields. When farmers dump nitrogen on a crop, much is wasted. It runs into the water and soil, where it either reacts chemically with its surroundings to form new compounds or flows off to fertilize something else, somewhere else.</p>
<p>That chemical reaction, called acidification, is noxious and contributes significantly to acid rain. One of the compounds produced by acidification is nitrous oxide, which aggravates the greenhouse effect. Green growing things normally offset global warming by sucking up carbon dioxide, but nitrogen on farm fields plus methane from decomposing vegetation make every farmed acre, like every acre of Los Angeles freeway, a net contributor to global warming. Fertilization is equally worrisome. Rainfall and irrigation water inevitably washes the nitrogen from fields to creeks and streams, which flows into rivers, which floods into the ocean. This explains why the Mississippi River, which drains the nation&#8217;s Corn Belt, is an environmental catastrophe. The nitrogen fertilizes artificially large blooms of algae that in growing suck all the oxygen from the water, a condition biologists call anoxia, which means &#8220;oxygen-depleted.&#8221; Here there&#8217;s no need to calculate long-term effects, because life in such places has no long term: everything dies immediately. The Mississippi River&#8217;s heavily fertilized effluvia has created a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico the size of New Jersey.</p>
<p>America&#8217;s biggest crop, grain corn, is completely unpalatable. It is raw material for an industry that manufactures food substitutes. Likewise, you can&#8217;t eat unprocessed wheat. You certainly can&#8217;t eat hay. You can eat unprocessed soybeans, but mostly we don&#8217;t. These four crops cover 82 percent of American cropland. Agriculture in this country is not about food; it&#8217;s about commodities that require the outlay of still more energy to become food.</p>
<p>About two thirds of U.S. grain corn is labeled &#8220;processed,&#8221; meaning it is milled and otherwise refined for food or industrial uses. More than 45 percent of that becomes sugar, especially high-fructose corn sweeteners, the keystone ingredient in three quarters of all processed foods, especially soft drinks, the food of America&#8217;s poor and working classes. It is not a coincidence that the American pandemic of obesity tracks rather nicely with the fivefold increase in corn-syrup production since Archer Daniels Midland developed a high-fructose version of the stuff in the early seventies. Nor is it a coincidence that the plague selects the poor, who eat the most processed food.</p>
<p>It began with the industrialization of Victorian England. The empire was then flush with sugar from plantations in the colonies. Meantime the cities were flush with factory workers. There was no good way to feed them. And thus was born the afternoon tea break, the tea consisting primarily of warm water and sugar. If the workers were well off, they could also afford bread with heavily sugared jam&#8211;sugar-powered industrialization. There was a 500 percent increase in per capita sugar consumption in Britain between 1860 and 1890, around the time when the life expectancy of a male factory worker was seventeen years. By the end of the century the average Brit was getting about one sixth of his total nutrition from sugar, exactly the same percentage Americans get today&#8211;double what nutritionists recommend.</p>
<p>There is another energy matter to consider here, though. The grinding, milling, wetting, drying, and baking of a breakfast cereal requires about four calories of energy for every calorie of food energy it produces. A two-pound bag of breakfast cereal burns the energy of a half-gallon of gasoline in its making. All together the food-processing industry in the United States uses about ten calories of fossil-fuel energy for every calorie of food energy it produces.</p>
<p>That number does not include the fuel used in transporting the food from the factory to a store near you, or the fuel used by millions of people driving to thousands of super discount stores on the edge of town, where the land is cheap. It appears, however, that the corn cycle is about to come full circle. If a bipartisan coalition of farm-state lawmakers has their way&#8211;and it appears they will&#8211;we will soon buy gasoline containing twice as much fuel alcohol as it does now. Fuel alcohol already ranks second as a use for processed corn in the United States, just behind corn sweeteners. According to one set of calculations, we spend more calories of fossil-fuel energy making ethanol than we gain from it. The Department of Agriculture says the ratio is closer to a gallon and a quart of ethanol for every gallon of fossil fuel we invest. The USDA calls this a bargain, because gasohol is a &#8220;clean fuel.&#8221; This claim to cleanness is in dispute at the tailpipe level, and it certainly ignores the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, pesticide pollution, and the haze of global gases gathering over every farm field. Nor does this claim cover clean conscience; some still might be unsettled knowing that our SUVs&#8217; demands for fuel compete with the poor&#8217;s demand for grain.</p>
<p>Green eaters, especially vegetarians, advocate eating low on the food chain, a simple matter of energy flow. Eating a carrot gives the diner all that carrot&#8217;s energy, but feeding carrots to a chicken, then eating the chicken, reduces the energy by a factor of ten. The chicken wastes some energy, stores some as feathers, bones, and other inedibles, and uses most of it just to live long enough to be eaten. As a rough rule of thumb, that factor of ten applies to each level up the food chain, which is why some fish, such as tuna, can be a horror in all of this. Tuna is a secondary predator, meaning it not only doesn&#8217;t eat plants but eats other fish that themselves eat other fish, adding a zero to the multiplier each notch up, easily a hundred times, more like a thousand times less efficient than eating a plant.</p>
<p>This is fine as far as it goes, but the vegetarian&#8217;s case can break down on some details. On the moral issues, vegetarians claim their habits are kinder to animals, though it is difficult to see how wiping out 99 percent of wildlife&#8217;s habitat, as farming has done in Iowa, is a kindness. In rural Michigan, for example, the potato farmers have a peculiar tactic for dealing with the predations of whitetail deer. They gut-shoot them with small-bore rifles, in hopes the deer will limp off to the woods and die where they won&#8217;t stink up the potato fields.</p>
<p>Animal rights aside, vegetarians can lose the edge in the energy argument by eating processed food, with its ten calories of fossil energy for every calorie of food energy produced. The question, then, is: Does eating processed food such as soy burger or soy milk cancel the energy benefits of vegetarianism, which is to say, can I eat my lamb chops in peace? Maybe. If I&#8217;ve done my due diligence, I will have found out that the particular lamb I am eating was both local and grass-fed, two factors that of course greatly reduce the embedded energy in a meal. I know of ranches here in Montana, for instance, where sheep eat native grass under closely controlled circumstances&#8211;no farming, no plows, no corn, no nitrogen. Assets have not been stripped. I can&#8217;t eat the grass directly. This can go on. There are little niches like this in the system. Each person&#8217;s individual charge is to find such niches.</p>
<p>Chances are, though, any meat eater will come out on the short end of this argument, especially in the United States. Take the case of beef. Cattle are grazers, so in theory could live like the grass-fed lamb. Some cattle cultures&#8211;those of South America and Mexico, for example&#8211;have perfected wonderful cuisines based on grass-fed beef. This is not our habit in the United States, and it is simply a matter of habit. Eighty percent of the grain the United States produces goes to livestock. Seventy-eight percent of all of our beef comes from feed lots, where the cattle eat grain, mostly corn and wheat. So do most of our hogs and chickens. The cattle spend their adult lives packed shoulder to shoulder in a space not much bigger than their bodies, up to their knees in shit, being stuffed with grain and a constant stream of antibiotics to prevent the disease this sort of confinement invariably engenders. The manure is rich in nitrogen and once provided a farm&#8217;s fertilizer. The feedlots, however, are now far removed from farm fields, so it is simply not &#8220;efficient&#8221; to haul it to cornfields. It is waste. It exhales methane, a global-warming gas. It pollutes streams. It takes thirty-five calories of fossil fuel to make a calorie of beef this way; sixty-eight to make one calorie of pork.</p>
<p>Still, these livestock do something we can&#8217;t. They convert grain&#8217;s carbohydrates to high-quality protein. All well and good, except that per capita protein production in the United States is about double what an average adult needs per day. Excess cannot be stored as protein in the human body but is simply converted to fat. This is the end result of a factory-farm system that appears as a living, continental-scale monument to Rube Goldberg, a black-mass remake of the loaves-and-fishes miracle. Prairie&#8217;s productivity is lost for grain, grain&#8217;s productivity is lost in livestock, livestock&#8217;s protein is lost to human fat&#8211;all federally subsidized for about $15 billion a year, two thirds of which goes directly to only two crops, corn and wheat.</p>
<p>This explains why the energy expert David Pimentel is so worried that the rest of the world will adopt America&#8217;s methods. He should be, because the rest of the world is. Mexico now feeds 45 percent of its grain to livestock, up from 5 percent in 1960. Egypt went from 3 percent to 31 percent in the same period, and China, with a sixth of the world&#8217;s population, has gone from 8 percent to 26 percent. All of these places have poor people who could use the grain, but they can&#8217;t afford it.</p>
<p>I live among elk and have learned to respect them. One moonlit night during the dead of last winter, I looked out my bedroom window to see about twenty of them grazing a plot of grass the size of a living room. Just that small patch among acres of other species of native prairie grass. Why that species and only that species of grass that night in the worst of winter when the threat to their survival was the greatest? What magic nutrient did this species alone contain? What does a wild animal know that we don&#8217;t? I think we need this knowledge.</p>
<p>Food is politics. That being the case, I voted twice in 2002. The day after Election Day, in a truly dismal mood, I climbed the mountain behind my house and found a small herd of elk grazing native grasses in the morning sunlight. My respect for these creatures over the years has become great enough that on that morning I did not hesitate but went straight to my job, which was to rack a shell and drop one cow elk, my household&#8217;s annual protein supply. I voted with my weapon of choice&#8211;an act not all that uncommon in this world, largely, I think, as a result of the way we grow food. I can see why it is catching on. Such a vote has a certain satisfying heft and finality about it. My particular bit of violence, though, is more satisfying, I think, than the rest of the globe&#8217;s ordinary political mayhem. I used a rifle to opt out of an insane system. I killed, but then so did you when you bought that package of burger, even when you bought that package of tofu burger. I killed, then the rest of those elk went on, as did the grasses, the birds, the trees, the coyotes, mountain lions, and bugs, the fundamental productivity of an intact natural system, all of it went on.</p>

			<p>Many people were horrified by the scandal surrounding cattle that were so weak that they were either being prodded with a forklift or actually carried to the kill room with the fork lift. Most people, not being involved in agriculture, wondered how anyone could be so callous. BUT the most disgusting thing you run into when you look into the issue of Factory Farming Cattle (and there are a lot of nasty things here) is that the corn that is feed to the cattle after they are weaned is killing them. So to slaughterhouse staff and meat packers its a matter timing whether they get them in the kill room before they die.</p>

CHINO, Calif. &#8212; Last year, a man carrying a hidden video camera took a $12-an-hour job at a little-known beef slaughterhouse here. Now the meatpacker is about to collapse, and has become a flashpoint in a national debate over meat safety and the quality of food Americans serve their schoolchildren.</p>
<p>Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Co., one of the biggest suppliers of beef to the national school-lunch program before videos showing animal cruelty at the plant helped trigger the biggest meat recall in U.S. history, probably will shut down permanently, according to the company&#8217;s general manager, Anthony Magidow.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>As John Robbins points out modern cattle raising is all about carving up cattle quick:</p>
<p align="center"><font size="5" color="#000099"><strong>What About Grass-fed Beef?</strong></font></p>
<p><a href="/wp-admin/#Email this article to"></a> <!--CONTENTS START HERE -->Feeding grain to cattle has got to be one of the dumbest ideas in the history of western civilization.</p>
<p>Cows, sheep, and other grazing animals are endowed with the ability to convert grasses, which those of us who possess only one stomach cannot digest, into food that we can digest. They can do this because they are ruminants, which is to say that they possess a rumen, a 45 or so gallon (in the case of cows) fermentation tank in which resident bacteria convert cellulose into protein and fats.</p>
<p>Traditionally, all beef was grass-fed beef, but in the United States today what is commercially available is almost all feedlot beef. The reason? It&#8217;s faster, and so more profitable. Seventy-five years ago, steers were 4 or 5 years old at slaughter. Today, they are 14 or 16 months. You can&#8217;t take a beef calf from a birth weight of 80 pounds to 1,200 pounds in a little more than a year on grass. It takes enormous quantities of corn, protein supplements, antibiotics and other drugs, including growth hormones.</p>
<p>Switching a cow from grass to grain is so disturbing to the animal&#8217;s digestive system that it can kill the animal if not done gradually and if the animal is not continually fed antibiotics. These animals are designed to forage, but we make them eat grain, primarily corn, in order to make them as fat as possible as fast as possible.<br>
 All this is not only unnatural and dangerous for the cows. It also has profound consequences for us. Feedlot beef as we know it today would be impossible if it weren&#8217;t for the routine and continual feeding of antibiotics to these animals. This leads directly and inexorably to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These are the new &#8220;superbugs&#8221; that are increasingly rendering our &#8220;miracle drugs&#8221; ineffective.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Letting Corporations into anything in agriculture besides processing is turning out to be a disaster in many respects from beginning to end. To this end we could talk about any plant or animal that we eat, but if we keep our focus on corn it becomes clear that all the corporate ag production affairs require one thing energy and lots of it.</p>
<p>While the movie, King Corn, has a lot going for it, like cute college kids out for a lark and the absurdity of growing an acre of anything in the current farm system, it is actually a pretty good look at why growing as much corn as we do is stupid and corporate farming only compounds that.</p>

<p>While the planting, growing and harvesting of field corn takes an incredible amount of energy, the real energy comes after it has been harvested. You can&#8217;t eat the stuff so it all has to be PROCESSED to be used or eaten by animals most of which don&#8217;t like the stuff but eat it if they are forced to.

<p>OKOKOKOKOK So maybe corn IS killing us but will we miss it when its gone because of energy prices. Probably not one bit though the first winter maybe tough if gasoline goes to $100 a gallon. The first to go though will be the exporting of grain. Do you believe we actually pile billions of tons of corn on diesal power ships so that other people can refine (errr spend their energy on) it? They can&#8217;t eat it either.</p>
