That&#8217;s what the XL Pipeline was all about and why the itt was so hotly contested. If you can&#8217;t bring fossil fuels to the market; What good are they? Well, New York tried to do it through legislation, and things got hot right away.</p>

<p>Last September, I <a href="https://www.globalenergyinstitute.org/start-spreading-news-new-york-126">wrote</a> about one of the boldest efforts yet by New York to halt energy infrastructure in its tracks.  This effort utilized a little-known provision of the Clean Air Act – the “good neighbor” provision at Section 126(b) – to argue that hundreds of energy-related and manufacturing facilities located across nine “upwind” states should be subject to additional, costly controls and limitations in order to assist New York in meeting its air quality obligations under 2008 and 2015 national ozone air quality standards.  Last week, the Federal Register <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2019-05-20/pdf/2019-09928.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published</a> the proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to reject New York’s far-reaching petition, providing momentary relief to the thousands of workers across nine states that found themselves within the crosshairs of New York’s “keep it in the ground” ideology.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>With this week’s EPA action, the comment period is now officially open for the public to weigh-in on whether it supports – or opposes – New York’s attempt to curtail or shut down legitimate business activities across Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia.  If you live in any one of these states, and particularly if you live near or work at any of the many <a href="https://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/air_pdf/sips126petition.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facilities targeted</a> (pages 33-42) by New York’s petition, now is the time for you to speak up.</p>
<p>Take a good look at the map below to see the locations of the many facilities targeted by New York’s petition.  Not surprisingly, power plants and refineries are major targets, but so are countless other facility types.  From a Pennsylvania facility that produces renewable energy from municipal waste to steel plants in Michigan to a box factory in rural Virginia, New York’s petition contorts the Clean Air Act well beyond the intended “major source or group of stationary sources” which are typically the subject of a state petition under Section 126.  Even a facility in western Indiana at Purdue University – which is more than 400 miles away from New York’s westernmost border – is targeted as a “bad neighbor” by New York’s complaint.</p>

<p>Go there and read. More next week.</p>

<h1>Coal, nuclear plant operator files for bankruptcy, asks Trump for a bailout</h1>

<p>On Saturday, power corporation FirstEnergy placed its coal and nuclear generation units <a href="https://cms.arstechnica.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=226681&amp;action=edit">under chapter 11 bankruptcy</a>. Although coal and nuclear plants across the country have struggled to compete with the low prices of natural gas, FirstEnergy&#8217;s filing is unique because it stands to take on a political dimension. Just two days before FirstEnergy&#8217;s bankruptcy filing, the company petitioned the Department of Energy (DOE) for an emergency bailout, <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/firstenergy-asks-doe-for-emergency-action-to-save-pjm-coal-nuke-plants/520280/">citing concerns about reliability</a>.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p>The petition could reinvigorate a debate started by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/energy-secretary-proposes-rule-to-make-grid-managers-favor-coal-nuclear/">proposed a rule</a> last year to change how coal and nuclear plants are compensated for their power. The rule was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/federal-regulator-denies-rick-perrys-proposal-to-compensate-coal-nuclear/">denied by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> (FERC), which said that there was not enough evidence to justify changing how coal and nuclear are compensated.</p>
<p>FirstEnergy disparaged FERC&#8217;s decision in <a href="https://statepowerproject.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/fes-202c-application.pdf">its Thursday petition</a> (PDF), claiming that &#8220;as a result of FERC’s and the RTO&#8217;s [Regional Transmission Organization&#8217;s] failure to address this crisis, swift and decisive action is needed <em>now</em> to address this imminent loss of nuclear and coal-fired baseload generation and the threat to the electric grid that this loss poses&#8221; (emphasis FirstEnergy&#8217;s).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The real important point from this article for me is that, &#8216;The die was cast around 1998, when GDP growth and electricity demand growth became “decoupled”&#8217;. In other words, for the last 2o years the utilities should have been investing in renewables and they did not. The point being that renewables are easier to turn &#8220;off&#8221; when you do not need them. If the utilities start investing heavily now in renewables they may survive. It is a horse race at this point.</p>

<p>The US electricity sector is in a period of unprecedented change and turmoil. Renewable energy prices are <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/8/30/16224582/wind-solar-exceed-expectations-again">falling like crazy</a>. Natural gas production continues its <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/10/2/6892781/how-the-oil-and-gas-boom-is-changing-america">extraordinary surge</a>. Coal, the golden child of the current administration, is <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/10/19/16494472/trump-coal-futile">headed down the tubes</a>.</p>
<p>In all that bedlam, it’s easy to lose sight of an equally important (if less sexy) trend: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-25/u-s-power-demand-flatlined-years-ago-and-it-s-hurting-utilities">Demand for electricity is stagnant</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to a combination of greater energy efficiency, outsourcing of heavy industry, and customers generating their own power on site, demand for utility power has been flat for 10 years, and most forecasts expect it to <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/data/browser/#/?id=8-AEO2017&amp;region=0-0&amp;cases=ref2017&amp;start=2015&amp;end=2050&amp;f=A&amp;linechart=~ref2017-d120816a.56-8-AEO2017&amp;ctype=linechart&amp;sourcekey=0">stay that way</a>. The die was cast around 1998, when GDP growth and electricity demand growth became “decoupled”:</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">Cape Town is in the unenviable situation of being the first major city in the modern era to face the threat of running out of drinking water.</p>
<p>However, the plight of the drought-hit South African city is just one extreme example of a problem that experts have long been warning about &#8211; water scarcity.</p>
<p>Despite covering about 70% of the Earth&#8217;s surface, water, especially drinking water, is not as plentiful as one might think. Only 3% of it is fresh.</p>
<p>Over one billion people lack access to water and another 2.7 billion find it scarce for at least one month of the year. A 2014 survey of the world&#8217;s 500 largest cities estimates that one in four are in a situation of &#8220;water stress&#8221;</p>
<p>According to UN-endorsed projections, global demand for fresh water will exceed supply by 40% in 2030, thanks to a combination of climate change, human action and population growth.</p>

<h1 class="headline node-title">Severe water shortages around the world: Why the taps run dry</h1>
<div class="label-inline">Published</div>
<p>Feb 13, 2018, 7:30 pm SGT</p>
<p>PARIS (AFP) &#8211; The world has abundant freshwater but it is unevenly distributed and under increasing pressure, UN agencies say, as highlighted by the severe shortages in Cape Town.</p>
<h4>WATER, WATER &#8216;EVERYWHERE&#8217;</h4>
<p>More than 97 per cent of the planet&#8217;s water is salty, most of it in the oceans and seas, but there is also a good supply of freshwater.</p>
<p>Every year around 42.8 trillion cubic metres of renewable freshwater circulates as rain, surface water or groundwater, according to the UN&#8217;s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).</p>
<p>This equals 16,216 litres per person per day &#8211; four times the amount required in the United States, for example, for personal and domestic consumption, industry and agriculture.</p>
<p>Depending on diet and lifestyle, a person needs between 2,000 and 5,000 litres of water a day to produce their food and meet their drinking and sanitation requirements, the FAO says.</p>
<p>About 60 per cent of the planet&#8217;s freshwater reserves is locked in the Antarctic.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t even agree on how much water we have. Go there and read a lot. More next week.</p>

<h2 class="entry-title fusion-post-title" data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">Installation of New England’s Largest Battery Energy Storage System is Underway</h2>
<div class="post-content">
<p>NEC Energy Solutions has begun the installation and commissioning of a 2 MW, 3.9MWh GSS® grid energy storage solution for the Sterling Municipal Light Department (SMLD) in Sterling, Massachusetts. Once complete in December 2016, it will be the largest system of its kind installed in New England and the first utility scale project in the State. In the event of an extended grid outage due to a natural disaster, this utility scale Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) can be used to power local emergency response facilities using power generated from two nearby solar plants. The system will also provide enhanced clean energy usage and cost savings to the town of Sterling.</p>
<p>Sandia provided SMLD with analysis to identify the optimal deployment site, amount, and installation type of energy storage within budgetary limits. Sandia also assisted with crafting a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the BESS system, vetting bids, and installing and dispatching the system. “Sandia was instrumental in helping us pull that together. We had developed a minor RFP and they brought in the technical support that we needed to get this done right. Working with Dan Borneo and Ray Byrne on this project has been very valuable to us,” said Sean Hamilton, General Manager of SMLD.</p>
<p>Going forward, Sandia will help SMLD oversee the operation of the BESS to optimally maximize economic returns while safeguarding SMLD’s ability to provide resilient power; monitor BESS operations; and collect operational data for one-year post-commissioning. The data will be used to further the U.S. Department of Energy’s/Sandia’s understanding of the benefits and applications of battery storage in the utility context and provide a number of important battery use cases in resiliency, cost savings, and revenues that can be adopted by numerous municipal utilities and vertically integrated utilities.</p>

<p>Capping a week of 100<sup>th </sup>anniversary celebrations for the National Park Service, President Barack Obama on Friday turned to the ocean to create the largest protected area anywhere on Earth—a half-million-square-mile arc of remote Pacific waters known for both exceptional marine life and importance to native Hawaiian culture.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The Papah?naumoku?kea Marine National Monument, established in 2006 by President George W. Bush, already covered 140,000 square miles of ocean around the uninhabited northwestern islands of Hawaii, Obama’s home state.

<p>Obama more than quadrupled Papah?naumoku?kea’s size, to 582,578 square miles, an area larger than all the national parks combined. Using his executive authority under the U.S. Antiquities Act, he extended most of the monument’s boundary—and its prohibition of commercial fishing—out to the 200-mile limit of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ).(<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/08/katahdin-woods-waters-national-monument-maine/">Read about a monument established this week in the Maine woods.</a>)</p>

</ul>
<p>Deep inside Facebook&#8217;s very first data center, located in a <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/silicon-forest/index.ssf/2015/09/facebook_greenlights_third_pri.html">sprawling facility in the hills of Prineville, OR</a>, lies a series of about 60 server racks. Each one houses 32 smartphones, all of which are running a version of one of Facebook&#8217;s many mobile apps. The company calls this setup the Mobile Device Lab, and it&#8217;s designed to test Facebook&#8217;s software on older phones to discover whether any bit of a new code, no matter how minor, results in a dip in performance or poorer battery life. For those smartphone owners who tote around a two- or even three-year-old device — and users in developing countries purchasing lower-cost devices for the first time — the lab is the very reason Facebook is still a viable home screen staple.</p>
<p>Antoine Reversat, part of Facebook&#8217;s production engineering team, opens one of the racks for a group of reporters during its first Oregon data center tour in almost three years this week. Behind a large black metal door sit 32 iPhone 5C devices all in the process of either scrolling through the News Feed, testing various operations&#8217; lag on battery consumption, or rebooting to resume an identical state before running yet another test. In each server row sits more than a dozen racks, some holding devices as old as the iPhone 4 and others housing newer Google Nexus 5s. In total, Facebook has almost 2,000 handsets used to tell developers when they&#8217;ve screwed something up, and whether that degradation is only noticeable on an older phone.</p>
<p>With Facebook serving more than 1.65 billion users around the world, taking into account every variation in device type, mobile operating system, and network condition has become an increasingly complex operation. Entire companies have built robust operations around testing mobile software in similar fashion, and some of those startups have been scooped up by big-name competitors. In 2014, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/google-appurify/">Google bought San Francisco-based mobile app tester Appurify</a>. Facebook&#8217;s engineers, on the other hand, figured the company could do the job itself, especially considering it had the computing power and server rack space at its expansive Oregon data center.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, right off the bat I have to say that this is a for profit business in the waste handling business. The part of their website about recycling is excellent. There business practices may not be. I have never been to Britain and I do not intend to start. Readers will have to judge for themselves. I f they are really bad folks or really good folks let me know.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kenburn.co.uk/recycling-for-kids/">http://www.kenburn.co.uk/recycling-for-kids/</a></p>
<h1>Recycling for Kids</h1>
<p>Did you know that recycling helps save the planet from things like global warming and rubbish? That’s right, by recycling things such as food packets and old toys, you are reducing the amount that gets put into the rubbish bin. This is a very good thing, because rubbish is full of nasty bugs that spread diseases and gases that increase global warming.</p>
<p>But what is recycling? How are things recycled? And what can you do to get more people to recycle?</p>
<p>Read through this leaflet, and by the end of it you will be able to teach your parents a thing or 2 about recycling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is Recycling?</h3>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://www.kenburn.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bin3.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-3009" src="http://www.kenburn.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bin3-300x292.jpg" alt="bin3" width="430" height="419" /></a>Fun Fact:</em></strong><em> If we took all of the UK’s rubbish and put it in its biggest lake, it would take 8 months to fill it!</em></p>
<p>Recycling means making rubbish into something new. Every time you throw something away it gets sent to a landfill. More and more rubbish is piled on top until it is too big and the landfill has to be closed.</p>
<p>The great thing is that most things can be recycled. Every day, clever scientists come up with new ways to make use of things we usually consider rubbish. But what exactly do they do with the recycling?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To the deserts of Texas, there are so many places that humans want to live in the United States  that they should not. In particular where they could not under normal circumstances build houses. Especially someplace like Las Vegas.</p>
<p>So I think that most of Southern California should be torn down. You say, are you crazy? That is one of the nicest places to live on the planet. But it is not if you have to live on the resources available directly in the area. By that I mean Energy and Water.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="inset-thumbnail-small" src="http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DX802_0731LA_F_20140731195928.jpg" alt="" width="571" height="226" /></p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">Lawn Dude was unveiled Thursday by the Southern California Water Committee, a nonprofit advocacy group, and <a class="t-company" href="http://quotes.wsj.com/CCO" data-ls-seen="1">Clear Channel Outdoor</a> <span class="article-chiclet up" data-channel-path="/quotes/nls/cco" data-channel-last-price="7.53" data-channel-currency="$" data-utc-offset-hours="-4" data-ticker-code="CCO" data-country-code="US"> <span class="ticker"> <a href="http://quotes.wsj.com/CCO" data-ls-seen="1">CCO +0.80%</a> </span> </span> as part of a campaign to <a class="icon none" href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/california-cities-crack-down-on-water-use-amid-drought-1404170293" target="_new" data-ls-seen="1" rel="noopener">get southern Californians to conserve water</a> during the state&#8217;s protracted drought.</p>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">The new mascot will be popping up on billboards donated by Clear Channel Outdoor across the parched region, spouting catchphrases like &#8220;Don&#8217;t hose me man!&#8221; as reminders to refrain from overwatering lawns. On another billboard, Lawn Dude carries a martini glass holding a daisy and says, &#8220;I only drink 2 days a week&#8221;—a nod to limits on outdoor irrigation to twice a week in some communities.</p>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">Lawn Dude&#8217;s debut came two days after California&#8217;s emergency restrictions on residential water use went into effect Tuesday—the same day, incidentally, that a <a class="icon none" href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/ucla-campus-dries-out-after-flood-1406752432" target="_new" data-ls-seen="1" rel="noopener">water main burst</a> on Sunset Boulevard here, gushing 20 million gallons of the precious resource into city streets and flooding much of the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles. City officials said the wasted water represented 4% of the city&#8217;s daily use.</p>
<p style="font-size: 15px;">The new restrictions ban residents from washing off driveways and sidewalks, and from watering landscapes or lawns in a way that causes &#8220;excess runoff.&#8221; Rule-breakers could be fined up to $500 a day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I get this question all the time. The argument is always the trade off argument. We get jobs and cheap fossil fuels but  the environment is degraded. And boy and how. Destroyed is more like it but we do not even get the results that the fracking industry promised. Did I mention it is cold outside?</p>

<h2 style="visibility: visible;">Record high prices for propane, natural gas in some markets as cold snap saps fuel supplies</h2>

<p>NEW YORK — A second fierce blast of winter weather is sapping fuel supplies in many regions and sending prices for propane and natural gas to record highs.</p>
<p>Higher natural gas prices are also leading to sharply higher wholesale electricity prices as power utilities snap up gas at almost any price to run power plants to meet higher-than-normal winter demand.</p>
<p>Propane users will get pinched the most. Those who find themselves suddenly needing to fill their tanks could be paying $100 to $200 more per fill up than a month ago. Homeowners who use natural gas and electricity will see higher heating bills because they&#8217;ll use more fuel. But prices won&#8217;t rise dramatically because utilities only buy a small portion of the fuel at the elevated prices.</p>
<p>A swirling storm with the potential for more than a foot of snow clobbered the mid-Atlantic and the urban Northeast on Tuesday. The snowstorm will be followed by bitter cold as arctic air from Canada streams in, causing homeowners to crank up the thermostat.</p>

<p>NEW YORK — A second fierce blast of winter weather is sapping fuel supplies in many regions and sending prices for propane and natural gas to record highs.</p>
<p>Higher natural gas prices are also leading to sharply higher wholesale electricity prices as power utilities snap up gas at almost any price to run power plants to meet higher-than-normal winter demand.</p>
<p>Propane users will get pinched the most. Those who find themselves suddenly needing to fill their tanks could be paying $100 to $200 more per fill up than a month ago.

<p>A swirling storm with the potential for more than a foot of snow clobbered the mid-Atlantic and the urban Northeast on Tuesday. The snowstorm will be followed by bitter cold as arctic air from Canada streams in, causing homeowners to crank up the thermostat.</p>
<p>Michael McCafferty, a propane expert at Platts, an energy information provider, said the wholesale spot price of propane rose 70 percent between Friday and Tuesday to a record $2.45 per gallon. Both the size of the jump and the price itself he called &#8220;unprecedented.&#8221;</p>
