<p id="first" class="lead">Emissions of methane from the industrial sector have been vastly underestimated, researchers from Cornell University and Environmental Defense Fund have found.</p>
<div id="text">
<p>Using a Google Street View car equipped with a high-precision methane sensor, the researchers discovered that methane emissions from ammonia fertilizer plants were 100 times higher than the fertilizer industry&#8217;s self-reported estimate. They also were substantially higher than the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimate for all industrial processes in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;We took one small industry that most people have never heard of and found that its methane emissions were three times higher than the EPA assumed was emitted by all industrial production in the United States,&#8221; said John Albertson, co-author and professor of civil and environmental engineering. &#8220;It shows us that there&#8217;s a huge gap between a priori estimates and real-world measurements.&#8221;</p>

<p>High temperatures are forecast to reach the mid-80s this week in New York, and I’m dreading it. But I have a plan to stay cool: just thinking of how much hotter it is in Pakistan, which is in the middle of a blistering heat wave.</p>
<p>Temperatures <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1404959" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported to have </a>cracked 50.2 degrees Celsius (122.3 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday in Nawabshah, located about 127 miles northeast of Karachi. If confirmed, that could make the measurement not just the hottest ever recorded for April in Pakistan, but the hottest ever reliably recorded for April anywhere on Earth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>But food poisoning is pretty common. Just think of the energy use on the farm. Huge machines powered by diesel gasoline, and huge energy consumption in fertilizers. We then transport the food huge distances. We sell them in huge stores oh keep the lights on at the local utility companies. Finally those of us in the first world drive it home in our and put it in our always on refrigerator.  So the fact that we let this thing called food sicken us but also kills us is just inexcusable. This on top of what some of us throw away. Well here is a site thate has on the facts. Unfortunately it is done mostly in photographs and this blog has problems with pictures so go there and look.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.health-science-degree.com/food-poisioning/">http://www.health-science-degree.com/food-poisioning/</a></p>
<p><strong>Health-Science-Degree.com</strong></p>
<p>The need to feed billions of people efficiently (and make billions of dollars off it) has given rise to large-scale animal farming operations. But are these mega-operations helping feed us or making us all sick?</p>
<h2>The Rise of the Factory Farm</h2>
<p>Factory farms, more accurately called concentrated animal feed operations (CAFOs), are large-scale industrial agricultural facilities that raise animals (usually at high density and kept in confined spaces) for human consumption.<br />
<strong>5%</strong><br />
Proportion of CAFOs among all U.S. animal farming operations<br />
<strong>50%</strong><br />
Food animals that come from CAFOs<br />
Due in part to these massive factory farms, since 1960 …<br />
… milk production has doubled<br />
… meat production has tripled<br />
… egg production has quadrupled<br />
Such operations also have introduced means to make animals grow heavier more quickly; chickens, for instance, grow twice as large in about half the time:<br />
<em>Decade</em> <em>Growth time</em> <em>Weight</em><br />
1920 16 weeks 2.2 pounds<br />
2013 7 weeks 5 pounds</p>
<h2>The Filthy Truth</h2>
<p>In addition to the moral and ethical problems with keeping animals in tiny pens where their natural behaviors are stunted, there’s the very real problem of what to do with all the waste they produce.<br />
These operations can house upwards of …<br />
1,000+ beef cows<br />
10,000+ chickens<br />
10,000+ hogs<br />
That adds up to tons and tons of — well, poop.<br />
<strong>300 million tons</strong><br />
Annual manure production of animals from CAFOs; that’s 65% of the waste from all animal operations in the U.S. And it’s more than double the amount of waste produced by the entire U.S. human population.<br />
This manure contains a variety of potential contaminants, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, E. coli, growth hormone, antibiotics, animal blood, copper sulfate and more. These contaminants find their way to the groundwater and even pollute the air.<br />
In addition to the manure concern is the possibility that keeping animals in such close quarters encourages infections that are then passed to consumers.</p>
<h2>The Risks of Factory Meat</h2>
<p>CAFOs are susceptible primarily to three pathogens that also make people sick.<br />
<strong><em>E. coli</em></strong><br />
Introduction of a grain-based diet, rather than a grass-based diet, has raised E. coli rates among cows. While E. coli is always present in cows’ stomachs, grain-based diets have given rise to more harmful strains, such as O157:H7, which has found its way into water, produce and meat in recent years.<br />
<strong>16%</strong><br />
Percentage of foodborne illnesses caused by strains of E. coli<br />
<strong><em>MRSA</em></strong><br />
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus can be spread by human and animal carriers and has become abundant in our environment. European studies have shown a link between MRSA and factory pig farms.<br />
<strong>80,000</strong><br />
Annual MRSA infections in humans, though many cases occur in hospital settings<br />
<strong><em>Campylobacter and salmonella</em></strong><br />
Campylobacter and salmonella are most commonly found in eggs and poultry, and both pathogens have recently shown signs of drug resistance.<br />
<em>Positive tests for salmonella</em><br />
Farms with caged hens 23.4%<br />
Organic flocks 4.4%<br />
Free-range flocks 6.5%<br />
<strong>62%</strong><br />
Chicken sold in supermarkets contaminated with campylobacter</p>
<h2>The Environmental Effects</h2>
<p>Potential damage to the environment from mismanagement of the tons of waste produced by these massive operations extends to both the air and water.</p>
<ul>
<li>Excess nitrogen and phosphorus in water</li>
<li>Fish kills</li>
<li>Toxic algal blooms</li>
<li>Waste and pathogens in drinking water</li>
<li>Respiratory problems from dust and odors</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many things that environmentalists have said over the years. The 2 most consistently true ones are that there are too many people on this planet and the other is that we will pay a price for befouling our planet. This has led some to talk about the possibility of a human &#8220;die back&#8221;. Is this what the beginning of one might look like?</p>

<h2>China&#8217;s mysterious pig, duck, and people deaths could be connected. And that should worry us.</h2>
</div>
<h3>BY LAURIE GARRETT | APRIL 1, 2013</h3>
</div>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it would happen. Children playing along an urban river bank would spot hundreds of grotesque, bloated pig carcasses bobbing downstream. Hundreds of miles away, angry citizens would protest the rising stench from piles of dead ducks and swans, their rotting bodies collecting by the thousands along river banks. And three unrelated individuals would stagger into three different hospitals, gasping for air. Two would quickly die of severe pneumonia and the third would lay in critical condition in an intensive care unit for many days. Government officials would announce that a previously unknown virus had sickened three people, at least, and killed two of them. And while the world was left to wonder how the pigs, ducks, swans, and people might be connected, the World Health Organization would release deliberately terse statements, offering little insight.</p>
<p>It reads like a movie plot &#8212; I should know, as I was a consultant for Steven Soderbergh&#8217;s <em>Contagion</em>. But the facts delineated are all true, and have transpired over the last six weeks in China. The events could, indeed, be unrelated, and the new virus, a form of influenza denoted as H7N9, may have already run its course, infecting just three people and killing two.</p>
<p>Or this could be how pandemics begin.</p>
<p>On March 10, residents of China&#8217;s powerhouse metropolis, Shanghai, noticed some dead pigs floating among garbage flotsam in the city&#8217;s Huangpu River. The vile carcasses appeared in Shanghai&#8217;s most important tributary of the mighty Yangtze, a 71-mile river that is edged by the Bund, the city&#8217;s main tourist area, and serves as the primary source of drinking water and ferry travel for the 23 million residents of the metropolis and its millions of visitors. The vision of a few dead pigs on the surface of the Huangpu was every bit as jarring for local Chinese as porcine carcasses would be for French strolling the Seine, Londoners along the Thames, or New Yorkers looking from the Brooklyn Bridge down on the East River.</p>

<h1>Drought eases in U.S. Midwest, worsens in northern Plains</h1>
<div id="articleInfo">
<p>By Karl Plume</p>
<p>Thu Aug 30, 2012 9:30pm IST</p>
</div>
<p>(Reuters) &#8211; The worst U.S. drought in a half century loosened its grip on the Midwest in the past week, helped by rain and cooler temperatures, but the drought grew more dire in the northern Plains, a report from climate experts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>But the improved Midwest weather arrived too late for crops in major farm states such as Kansas, Iowa, Illinois and Indiana, where severe corn and soybean yield losses have already been realized.</p>
<p>The portion of the contiguous United States suffering from at least &#8220;severe&#8221; drought fell to 42.34 percent from 44.03 percent over the prior week, according to the Drought Monitor, a weekly synthesis representing a consensus climatologists.</p>
<p>The percentage of the Midwest in that category slipped to 49.96 from 51.06 the previous week, with the most notable improvement in Indiana, 64.07 percent of which was under severe drought or worse, down from 81.48 percent a week ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>But the damage has already been done. The next question is what about next year. First, the seed corn was a total wash this year so right now they are trying to grow enough in Brazil to even get us going next year. But then the next question is when to plant and where. If anybody was a good enough predictor to get in during or right after the late frost then your corn would be fine and you would be sitting on a gold mine. This is contingent on us getting some moisture over the winter. If we don&#8217;t get enough moisture well then next year looks bleak.</p>

<p>Thursday 30 August 2012 10.44 EDT</p>
<p>Flying into Des Moines, the corn fields look surprisingly green. America&#8217;s midwest produces half the world&#8217;s corn and <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Iowa" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/iowa">Iowa</a> its largest harvest, yet amid the worst drought in living memory all  the untrained eye can see is the occasional brown mark, like a cigarette  burn on the baize of a pool table.</p>
<p>But appearances can be deceptive.</p>
<p>In  Boone, Iowa, 30 miles away from the state capital, traffic backs up for  miles bringing 200,000 people to Farm Progress, the US&#8217;s largest  agricultural show one. Here, all the talk is of the drought.</p>
<p>Pam  Johnson, first vice-president of the National Corn Growers Association,  says she can&#8217;t remember one as bad as this in her 40 years of <a title="More from guardian.co.uk on Farming" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/farming">farming</a>.  &#8220;My parents say you have to go back to the 1930s for anything  comparable,&#8221; she says. In June, her farm in northern Iowa got an inch  and a half of rain. &#8220;We usually get that a week. In July we got  seven-tenths of an inch, for the month.&#8221; Rain may be coming soon, thanks  to hurricane Isaac, but it&#8217;s too late for America&#8217;s corn crop.</p>
<p>The  US planted 97m acres of corn for this year&#8217;s crop – the most since  1937. If everything had gone according to plan, this year&#8217;s harvest  would have produced a new record, at close to 15bn bushels of corn (a  bushel is 24 million metric tonnes). It&#8217;s too early to say what the  final tally will be, but the US department of agriculture has slashed  its forecast to 10.8bn. Dan Basse, president of AgResources, an  independent agriculture analyst, says that figure is likely to come  down. &#8220;We&#8217;ve lost 4bn bushels of corn. That&#8217;s the largest loss in  history, and we could lose another,&#8221; he says. The USDA has declared  counties in 38 states to be &#8220;disaster areas&#8221;. About 72% of cattle areas  are experiencing drought.</p>

<h1>In drought, drillers offering even water witching</h1>
<p>Well driller Randy Gebke usually uses a geology database and other  high-tech tools to figure out where to sink new water wells for clients.  But if asked, he&#8217;ll grab two wires, walk across the property, waiting  for the wires to cross to find a place to drill.</p>

<p>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. —</p>
<p>Well driller Randy Gebke usually uses a geology  database and other high-tech tools to figure out where to sink new water  wells for clients. But if asked, he&#8217;ll grab two wires, walk across the  property, waiting for the wires to cross to find a place to drill.</p>
<p>Gebke is water witching, using an ancient method with a greater connection to superstition than science.</p>
<p>Thousands of wells have gone dry this summer in the worst drought the  nation has experienced in decades. Some homeowners are spending as much  as $30,000 to have new ones drilled, and Gebke said most potential  customers in his area expect water witching to be part the deal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over 50 percent of the time in that conversation, they ask do we  have a witcher on the crew,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And my response is, `We have a  witcher on every crew.'&#8221;</p>

<h1>Tropical Storm Isaac could bring welcome rain to Midwest but unlikely to break drought</h1>
<div>
<h3>By  Associated Press,</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>OMAHA, Neb. — The remnants of  Tropical Storm Isaac could bring welcome rain to some states in the  Mississippi River valley this week, but experts say it’s unlikely to  break the drought gripping the Midwest.</p>
<p>Along with the deluge of rain expected along the Gulf Coast  when Isaac makes landfall, the National Weather Service predicts 2 to 6  inches of rain will fall in eastern Arkansas, southeast Missouri and  southern Illinois.</p>
</div>
<p>Those areas are among those hard hit by the drought that  stretches from the West Coast east into Kentucky and Ohio, with pockets  in Georgia and Alabama. The rain that falls inland likely will ease but  not eliminate drought, because those areas are so dry, said Mark  Svoboda, a climatologist with the National Drought Mitigation Center.</p>
<p>Arkansas  rancher Don Rodgers said his area is short 17 inches of rain this year.  He said even a couple of inches from Isaac would make a significant  difference because he would have water for his cattle and might be able  to grow some forage for this winter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why do I say that. Because the Sun is finally into its warming phase. The Sun always has 4 cycles: cooling, quietude, warming and maximus. These cycles inhabit an 11 year cycle most probably related to the creation of some of the heavier elements in its core. What does change in no known sequence is which is bigger the cooling cycle or the warming cycle and I suppose some brief time periods of equilibrium. For the last 30 years (almost 3 full cycles) the cooling side of the cycle has been bigger than the heating cycle and the last quietude was almost 2 full years which I believe is the biggest in recorded history. Here is the point. The planet should be cooling but it isn&#8217;t. During the cooling we still had some pretty hot years. Why. There is no other thing to blame, but humans. Now that the Sun is heating up and for the next 3 years or so, Watch Out!</p>

<p>If you think the <a href="http://www.examiner.com/topic/drought">drought</a> of summer 2012 is only increasing the prices of the nation&#8217;s corn and grain supplies, you&#8217;re missing a large part of the picture.

<p>The United States is experiencing the most severe drought, with the highest percentage of land affected by it, in over 60 years, according to the <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2012-07-16/us/us_us-drought_1_national-drought-mitigation-center-epic-drought-short-term-drought" rel="nofollow">National Climatic Data Center</a>&#8216;s July 17 report. (See August 5 <em>Palmer drought severity map</em> at left. Yellow = moderately dry, orange = severely dry, red = excessively dry.)</p>
<p>Parched conditions have now led to <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79303.html?hp=l5_b1" rel="nofollow">disaster declarations</a> in more than half the counties in the nation&#8211;1,584, in 32 states&#8211;this growing season. The declarations make these areas eligible for government aid, including low-interest emergency loans to hold the line until farms and ranches recover.</p>
<p>And the ripple effects of this brutal weather will extend farther than the farms in the Midwest, where corn and soybean crops are failing. It will affect meat production nationwide as well because pasture and grazing land has been blighted, forcing farmers and ranchers to seek other&#8211;and more expensive&#8211;feed for cows and other animals.</p>
<blockquote><p>In some areas, cattle have to be fed with next year&#8217;s grain reserves because local pasture lands have dried up. Almost four million acres of <a href="http://www.agrinews-pubs.com/articles/news/latest-news/default.asp?article=8A7427A0372184C3AEA33557CB10F29E0D32DBFBE9E0009B" rel="nofollow">federal conservation</a> land has been opened for haying and grazing. Crop insurers have also begun to provide <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/02/us-drought-2012-disaster-areas_n_1731393.html" rel="nofollow">penalty-free 30-day grace periods</a> on 2012 premiums.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well really the guys point is that there will have to be fast and furious changes from a growth model economy to a static or sustainable economy for humans to survive in the civilized manner that we have gotten accustomed to. Still the world has suffered severe trauma before and humans are still here. Plus I believe the subtext of his piece is that the rest of the planet will never notice that mankind ran out of oil or even very much that the climate was destabilized by climate change. It is a really really long article so I will give you a little bit here.</p>

<div>Can We Avoid the Perfect Storm?</div>
<div>By <a href="http://www.thesolutionsjournal.com/user/28">David Orr</a></div>
<div>&#8230;</div>
<p>It is quite possible that by the year 2100 human life will have become extinct or will be confined to a few residential areas that have escaped the devastating effects of nuclear holocaust or global warming.<br />
—Brian Barry<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Evolution equipped us to deal with threats from dependably loathsome enemies and fearsome creatures, but not with the opaque and cumulative long-term consequences of our own technological and demographic success. As cartoonist Walt Kelly once put it, “We’ve met the enemy, and he is us.”</p>
<p>Deforestation, agriculture, and the combustion of fossil fuels have committed the world to a substantial and possibly rapid warming that will last for hundreds or thousands of years. Rising temperatures, whether gradual or sudden, will progressively destabilize the global climate system, causing massive droughts, more frequent storms, rising sea level, loss of many species, and shifting ecologies, but in ways that are difficult to predict with precision in a nonlinear system. These changes will likely result in scarcities of food, energy, and resources, undermining political, social, and economic stability and amplifying the effects of terrorism and conflicts between and within nations, failed states, and regions.</p>
<p>Action to head off the worst of what could occur is difficult because of the complexity of nonlinear systems, with large delays between cause and effect, and because of the political and economic power of fossil fuel industries to prevent corrective action that would jeopardize their profitability. Political leadership has been absent in large part because no government is presently organized to deal with the permanent emergency of climate destabilization. The effects of procrastination will fall with increasing weight on coming generations, making our role as the primary cause of worsening climate destabilization the largest moral lapse in history.</p>
