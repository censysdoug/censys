										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I dare you to Google: Climate Change and plant life or Climate Change and small mammals. Most people who protest Global Warming, that is  &#8211; say it ain&#8217;t happening, talk about deserts shifting and extinctions leading to our vary own. They say that since those things aren&#8217;t happening, then Global Warming isn&#8217;t either. But in the beginning it will be increases in insect born diseases, increases in storm strength, and increases in drought. Here is just one example.</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">Longer seasons and warmer weather have combined to be a game-changer in the plant wars</h2>

<div class="pw-hidden-cp">
<p>Since the beginning of the 20th century, the growing season in many areas of the lower 48 states has expanded by about two weeks. Frosts end earlier in the spring and begin later in the fall. To gardeners in Maine, Wisconsin and Montana, that might seem a blessing. What’s not to like about more lettuce or riper tomatoes?</p>
<p>The longer seasons, however, are also helping invasive plants annex American soil; extended springs mean they can more quickly push aside native species and transform ecosystems. “What’s interesting about climate change is that humans are effectively manipulating how species experience time,” says ecologist Elizabeth Wolkovich of the Biodiversity Research Centre at the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p>Wolkovich and her colleagues have been studying how the first flowering dates of plants have changed over the years in Kansas, North Dakota, Washington, D.C., Concord, Massachusetts—where Henry David Thoreau kept notes about the flowers blooming near Walden Pond in the mid-1800s—as well as Britain.</p>

<p class="story-body__introduction">Cape Town is in the unenviable situation of being the first major city in the modern era to face the threat of running out of drinking water.</p>
<p>However, the plight of the drought-hit South African city is just one extreme example of a problem that experts have long been warning about &#8211; water scarcity.</p>
<p>Despite covering about 70% of the Earth&#8217;s surface, water, especially drinking water, is not as plentiful as one might think. Only 3% of it is fresh.</p>
<p>Over one billion people lack access to water and another 2.7 billion find it scarce for at least one month of the year. A 2014 survey of the world&#8217;s 500 largest cities estimates that one in four are in a situation of &#8220;water stress&#8221;</p>
<p>According to UN-endorsed projections, global demand for fresh water will exceed supply by 40% in 2030, thanks to a combination of climate change, human action and population growth.</p>

<h1 class="headline node-title">Severe water shortages around the world: Why the taps run dry</h1>
<div class="label-inline">Published</div>
<p>Feb 13, 2018, 7:30 pm SGT</p>
<p>PARIS (AFP) &#8211; The world has abundant freshwater but it is unevenly distributed and under increasing pressure, UN agencies say, as highlighted by the severe shortages in Cape Town.</p>
<h4>WATER, WATER &#8216;EVERYWHERE&#8217;</h4>
<p>More than 97 per cent of the planet&#8217;s water is salty, most of it in the oceans and seas, but there is also a good supply of freshwater.</p>
<p>Every year around 42.8 trillion cubic metres of renewable freshwater circulates as rain, surface water or groundwater, according to the UN&#8217;s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).</p>
<p>This equals 16,216 litres per person per day &#8211; four times the amount required in the United States, for example, for personal and domestic consumption, industry and agriculture.</p>
<p>Depending on diet and lifestyle, a person needs between 2,000 and 5,000 litres of water a day to produce their food and meet their drinking and sanitation requirements, the FAO says.</p>
<p>About 60 per cent of the planet&#8217;s freshwater reserves is locked in the Antarctic.</p>

<p>They don&#8217;t even agree on how much water we have. Go there and read a lot. More next week.</p>

<p>As cities grow and incomes rise around the world, more and more people are leaving gardens and traditional diets behind and eating refined sugars, refined fats, oils and resource- and land-intense agricultural products like beef. This global dietary transition is harming the health of both people and the planet, says new research.</p>
<p>But the study also shows that shifting away from this trajectory and choosing healthier traditional Mediterranean, pescatarian or vegetarian diets could not only boost human lifespans and quality of life, but also slash emissions and save habitat for endangered species.</p>
<p>And we better hurry; the scientists project that if the trend continues, the situation will be worse yet with greenhouse gas emissions up by 80 percent by 2050.</p>
<p>Examining almost 50 years’ worth of data from the world’s 100 most populous countries, University of Minnesota Professor of Ecology G. David Tilman and graduate student Michael Clark illustrate how current diet trends are contributing to ever-rising agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and habitat degradation.</p>
<p>On top of that, they write: “These dietary shifts are greatly increasing the incidence of Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and other chronic non-communicable diseases that lower global life expectancies.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>But food poisoning is pretty common. Just think of the energy use on the farm. Huge machines powered by diesel gasoline, and huge energy consumption in fertilizers. We then transport the food huge distances. We sell them in huge stores oh keep the lights on at the local utility companies. Finally those of us in the first world drive it home in our and put it in our always on refrigerator.  So the fact that we let this thing called food sicken us but also kills us is just inexcusable. This on top of what some of us throw away. Well here is a site thate has on the facts. Unfortunately it is done mostly in photographs and this blog has problems with pictures so go there and look.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.health-science-degree.com/food-poisioning/">http://www.health-science-degree.com/food-poisioning/</a></p>
<p><strong>Health-Science-Degree.com</strong></p>
<p>The need to feed billions of people efficiently (and make billions of dollars off it) has given rise to large-scale animal farming operations. But are these mega-operations helping feed us or making us all sick?</p>
<h2>The Rise of the Factory Farm</h2>
<p>Factory farms, more accurately called concentrated animal feed operations (CAFOs), are large-scale industrial agricultural facilities that raise animals (usually at high density and kept in confined spaces) for human consumption.<br />
<strong>5%</strong><br />
Proportion of CAFOs among all U.S. animal farming operations<br />
<strong>50%</strong><br />
Food animals that come from CAFOs<br />
Due in part to these massive factory farms, since 1960 …<br />
… milk production has doubled<br />
… meat production has tripled<br />
… egg production has quadrupled<br />
Such operations also have introduced means to make animals grow heavier more quickly; chickens, for instance, grow twice as large in about half the time:<br />
<em>Decade</em> <em>Growth time</em> <em>Weight</em><br />
1920 16 weeks 2.2 pounds<br />
2013 7 weeks 5 pounds</p>
<h2>The Filthy Truth</h2>
<p>In addition to the moral and ethical problems with keeping animals in tiny pens where their natural behaviors are stunted, there’s the very real problem of what to do with all the waste they produce.<br />
These operations can house upwards of …<br />
1,000+ beef cows<br />
10,000+ chickens<br />
10,000+ hogs<br />
That adds up to tons and tons of — well, poop.<br />
<strong>300 million tons</strong><br />
Annual manure production of animals from CAFOs; that’s 65% of the waste from all animal operations in the U.S. And it’s more than double the amount of waste produced by the entire U.S. human population.<br />
This manure contains a variety of potential contaminants, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, E. coli, growth hormone, antibiotics, animal blood, copper sulfate and more. These contaminants find their way to the groundwater and even pollute the air.<br />
In addition to the manure concern is the possibility that keeping animals in such close quarters encourages infections that are then passed to consumers.</p>
<h2>The Risks of Factory Meat</h2>
<p>CAFOs are susceptible primarily to three pathogens that also make people sick.<br />
<strong><em>E. coli</em></strong><br />
Introduction of a grain-based diet, rather than a grass-based diet, has raised E. coli rates among cows. While E. coli is always present in cows’ stomachs, grain-based diets have given rise to more harmful strains, such as O157:H7, which has found its way into water, produce and meat in recent years.<br />
<strong>16%</strong><br />
Percentage of foodborne illnesses caused by strains of E. coli<br />
<strong><em>MRSA</em></strong><br />
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus can be spread by human and animal carriers and has become abundant in our environment. European studies have shown a link between MRSA and factory pig farms.<br />
<strong>80,000</strong><br />
Annual MRSA infections in humans, though many cases occur in hospital settings<br />
<strong><em>Campylobacter and salmonella</em></strong><br />
Campylobacter and salmonella are most commonly found in eggs and poultry, and both pathogens have recently shown signs of drug resistance.<br />

<td>Doug,<strong>Honey bee populations are plummeting – this is your last chance to help.</strong></p>
<p><em>Alarming</em> – there&#8217;s no other way to describe what&#8217;s happening to honey bees. Up to 1/3 of our food supply is pollinated by honey bees. Without them, the health of our food supply is in serious danger. The widespread use of clothiandin is likely to blame, as this pesticide, which is <strong>highly toxic to bees, has yet to be conclusively proven safe for our crops.</strong> But still, clothiandin has been used on corn – our country&#8217;s largest crop source – since 2003!</p>
<p>The EPA is refusing to review the safety of this dangerous pesticide <em>until 2018</em>. Our honey bees and our food supply cannot wait another day. <strong><a href="http://soe.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=3pI5KGb6tz0k919JSN0qg58YdQxyCzZa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Please, take action TODAY to urge the EPA to save our honey bees before it&#8217;s too late. </a></strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana; font-size: x-small;">Since 2006, <strong>our honey bees have been dying off in droves. Billions of bees have disappeared in the U.S.</strong> with losses estimated at 30% per year.<sup>1</sup> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana; font-size: x-small;">And if the destruction of a species is disturbing enough on its own, <strong>the collapse of honey bee populations also threatens the security of our food supply</strong> since honey bee pollination is crucial to the cultivation of a full 1/3 of our food here in the U.S. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong><a href="http://soe.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=zlWkqpdGZzIk919JSN0qg58YdQxyCzZa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Urge the EPA to stop dragging its feet and take steps NOW to stem the collapse of honey bee colonies across the country.</a> </strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana; font-size: x-small;">Scientists have been scrambling to figure out what is behind this crisis – termed <strong>Colony Collapse Disorder</strong> – and believe it is probably the result of many interacting factors, including <strong>one widely used class of pesticides</strong> called neonicotinoids. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana; font-size: x-small;">One such chemical, called clothianidin, is produced by the German corporation Bayer CropScience. It is used as a treatment on crop seeds, including corn and canola which happen to be among honey bees&#8217; favorite foods. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Unfortunately, the EPA is refusing to make any changes until it completes its review of the safety of clothianidin <em>in 2018</em> – but our honey bees (and bee keepers, rural communities and farmers) can&#8217;t wait that long.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong><a href="http://soe.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=dIhdDwamg1Qk919JSN0qg58YdQxyCzZa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Tell the EPA: Ban the use of this pesticide that may be wiping out our honey bees before it&#8217;s too late. </a></strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana; font-size: x-small;">Shockingly, no major independent study has verified the safety of this pesticide. While clothianidin has been used on corn – the largest crop in the U.S. – since 2003, it was officially approved by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2010 on the basis of a single study, conducted by Bayer. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana; font-size: x-small;">But leaked EPA documents<sup>2</sup> expose a more sordid story. Agency scientists who reviewed Bayer&#8217;s study determined that the evidence was unsound and should not have been allowed as the basis for an unconditional approval of the pesticide. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Additional independent studies have shown that neonicotinoid pesticides like clothianidin are highly toxic to honey bees, providing compelling evidence that they should not continue to be approved by the EPA.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana; font-size: x-small;">France, Italy, Slovenia, and Germany have already banned clothianidin over concerns of its role in Colony Collapse Disorder. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana; font-size: x-small;">The stakes are far too high to continue the use of this chemical without independent science verifying that it is safe to use. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong><a href="http://soe.salsalabs.com/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=gcO0Azv%2BvO8k919JSN0qg58YdQxyCzZa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ask the EPA to ban the use of clothianidin NOW, not in 2018.</a></strong> </span></p>

<h1>Americans Are Becoming More Environmentally Aware &amp; Conscious Of Their Behaviors</h1>
<p>A new national survey of more than 1,000 Americans found that ‘being green’ is becoming more mainstream and has less of a stigma tied to it than it once did.</p>
<p>According to the survey, getting caught littering is more embarrassing to Americans than getting caught cheating on taxes.</p>
<p>Other behaviors that people admit to being socially aware that they’re doing include:</p>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li>not recycling plastic bottles</li>
<li>driving a vehicles that gets only a few miles per gallon</li>
<li>letting the water run while brushing teeth</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s clear that it is no longer just a highly motivated ‘few’ who are conscious about their own environmentally friendly actions these days.</p>
<h3>It’s The Little Things</h3>
<p>For most, it’s important to <a href="http://green.thefuntimesguide.com/category/home-garden/simple-ways-to-go-green">start small</a> in order to stay committed to living green.</p>
<p>In  my case, I set a few simple actions as my <a href="http://holidays.thefuntimesguide.com/2008/12/new_years_resolutions_facts.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Year’s Resolutions</a> a few years ago.</p>

<p>Transition Milwaukee (TM) is part of an international movement  formed, in part, in response to the peak oil crisis and more generally  around issues of climate change, economic security and permaculture  principles.</p>
<p>Peak oil is a non-controversial acknowledgement from government,  academic and industry experts that fossil fuels, a finite resource,  reach a peak moment of production and necessarily begin to decline.</p>
<p>Any controversy that peak oil generates is from determining when this  peak production will occur, from a few decades into the future to it  already peaking in 2007. Bigger questions about what a society that  can&#8217;t rely on fossil fuels looks like also stir up debate – and  emotions.</p>
<p>Permaculture principles are those that inform design and systems  theories about how to develop not only sustainable but self-maintained  and regenerative ecological systems. Modern agriculture and societies  based on oil consumption are not regarded as sustainable.</p>
<p>TM&#8217;s goals involve a &#8220;whole-systems&#8221; approach toward making our  economies sustainable and regenerative for seven generations into the  future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, Transition Milwaukee acts as a network of concerned  activists who are working toward reducing the radius in which we get our  goods and services, food, water and shelter,&#8221; says Jessica Cohodes, TM  steering committee leader, press contact and &#8220;big-picture synthesizer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Members of TM don&#8217;t really have official titles. Although it has a steering committee, TM is organized non-hierarchically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Transition Milwaukee has always been a group, grass-roots endeavor  about the community, from the ground up. Part of its founding philosophy  is that it isn&#8217;t someone else&#8217;s job to get us off oil, but our job,&#8221;  says Erik Lindberg, a former TM steering committee member who regularly  gives presentations on energy and the environment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In fact, some are so radical as to imply that our yards should be filled with food plants and locally indigenous plants. I personally believe that is food overkill but at least there would be no hunger in America. Here is more on lawns if you like them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.organiclawncare101.com/">http://www.organiclawncare101.com/</a></p>
<h1><span style="color: #993300;">The Grass is Greener &#8230; and Safer!</span></h1>
<p>Lawns may have been invented in Europe, but they&#8217;ve reached their  apotheosis in North America. For those in the U.S. of A, that green,  green grass ranks right up there with apple pie, backyard barbecues and  softball. For Canadians it&#8217;s proof of place, both a responsibility and a  privilege, like wearing decent clothes when you leave the house. Keep  your teeth clean and your grass green. In the lower 48 states and much  of southern Canada, grass is practically an obsession.</p>
<p>The problem with the perfect lawn is that it wreaks havoc on both your  wallet and the environment. Between 30 and 40 million acres of land in  the U.S. are devoted to turfgrass (see <a href="http://web.missouri.edu/%7eumcsnresiwww/news/July2004news.html" target="_new" rel="noopener">Curbing the Lawn</a>), and Americans collectively spend big bucks &#8212; about <a href="http://www.tufts.edu/alumni/magazine/summer2006/departments/bookshelf.html" target="_new" rel="noopener">$40 billion annually</a> &#8212; on seed, sod and chemicals. In Canada, which has around one tenth  the population of the U.S., sales from all lawn and garden products have  risen steadily over the past five years, to over $2 billion by 2007.  Click on &#8220;<a href="http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/16-002-XIE/2007002/200700210336-en.htm#footnote1" target="_new" rel="noopener">Canadian lawns and gardens: Where are they the &#8216;greenest&#8217;?</a>&#8221; for more on this.</p>
<p>Much of that money goes to products that &#8220;help&#8221; grass only in the  most superficial ways and that degrade the soil, pollute any water they  reach, and pose serious health threats to humans, their pets, and any  wildlife in the area, including birds. As people become aware of these  facts, attitudes towards conventional fertilizers and pesticides are  beginning to change. In Canada, over 130 communities and two entire  provinces have passed laws severely restricting pesticide use, so  homeowners and city park services are going organic perforce. In the  U.S., where municipalities in many states lack the power to pass such  comprehensive laws, a number of cities and towns have restricted the use  of pesticides on school grounds or in parks. Furthermore, while many  pesticides remain legal in the States, more and more people are becoming  aware of the strain that they place on the eco-system. All across North  America, people are not only considering going green, but whether the  perfect lawn is worth the long-term environmental price we&#8217;re paying for  it.</p>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> <strong>Green Goes Simple</strong></p>
<p><strong>By:Jeanann Pannasch</strong></p>
<p>February 28, 2012</p>
</div>
<p>As a couple, my husband and I were naturals to become part of the  green movement: We already used mass transportation, spent considerable  time camping in national parks and recycled obsessively (rinsing foil  and all). But it was the birth of our daughter that deepened our  commitment to making easy household changes &#8212; the idea of leaving the  world better for her and her generation.</p>
<p>Here’s how we created a greener home:</p>
<p><strong>1. To Market, to Market</strong><br />
Our vast collection of  reusable market bags started with two cute canvas totes I’d purchased at  a thrift store. Now we have about 14 totes, which we grab as readily as  we grab our keys on our way out the door for groceries. We’re keeping  plastic bags out of landfills, and as a bonus, the totes’ sturdy  shoulder straps make schlepping goods up the stairs to our front door  less back-breaking.</p>
<p><strong>2. What Good Things Grow</strong><br />
Through my husband’s  involvement with the local community garden, we learned about a massive  composting initiative, which takes neighborhood compostable waste and  transforms it into dark, nutrient-rich dirt. Now, after dinner, we take a  bowl of our unwanted onionskins, carrot peels and eggshells and leave  them in the bin at the garden gate. Less waste in our kitchen means that  our garbage bags go further too.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Seeing the Light</strong><br />
When compact fluorescent  lightbulbs (CFL) first became available (and the U.S. government  announced that if every home replaced one regular bulb with a CFL bulb,  we could prevent 9 billion pounds of greenhouse gas emissions per year),  it was a no-brainer. We made the switch, socket by socket. But we were  concerned when we learned that the mercury in these bulbs made proper  disposal an imperative. Fortunately, Home Depot has signed on as a  nationwide recycler, so all we have to do is to bring our used bulbs  there and look for the big orange bin just for CFLs.<strong></p>
<p>4. Second Lives</strong><br />
Living  on a tight budget through college is probably what ratcheted up my  resourcefulness. As a result, I’m always looking for the next use of an  item before throwing it away. The pink sheets that are now too scratchy  for sleeping? With a little time and effort, they became a doll, with  eyes made from old buttons and hair from my abandoned knitting-project  yarn. The old album covers collecting dust on the shelves? A couple of  ready-made frames transformed them into instant wall art.<strong></p>
<p>5. Off With It!</strong><br />
Hot  out? Line dry your clothes instead of using the dryer. Not actively on  the computer? Power down and unplug it. Bored? Reach for that huge pile  of been-meaning-to-read books instead of grabbing the remote. There are  hundreds of alternatives to the old electronic habits. And once you’re  committed to changing your habits, it’s easy not to look bac</p>

<h1>Growing Organic Vegetables</h1>
<p><em>By Eric Vinje, Planet Natural</em></p>
<p>If the thought of a ripe, juicy tomato makes your mouth water, or imagining snapping a crisp pea makes your fingers itch, then <a href="http://www.planetnatural.com/site/vegetable-gardening-articles.html">growing organic vegetables</a> is for you. Everyone knows that home grown veggies and fruits taste a  million times better than the varieties purchased at the grocery store.  So, go ahead, grow your own &#8212; it&#8217;s easy to do.</p>
<p><strong>Planning Your Garden</strong><br />
Whether you are starting a new garden or improving an existing one, it&#8217;s  best to start with a plan. A well-planned garden will not only be more  successful, it will be better organized and easier to manage. Consider  the following:</p>
<p><strong>Face South</strong><br />
Make sure your garden site gets plenty of sun by situating it facing  south. 6 hours of sunlight is the minimum your garden will need. Also,  be sure there aren&#8217;t any trees, hedges or other obstacles (like your  house) shading your potential plot.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid Weeds</strong><br />
If the area you&#8217;d like to garden is full of weeds, be sure to get rid of them before you start preparing your garden site.</p>
<p><strong>Start small &#8212; or don&#8217;t</strong><br />
Most experts recommend starting small so that you don&#8217;t become  overwhelmed. On the other hand who wants to do more prep work each year  enlarging their garden? If you feel pretty certain you&#8217;ll want a lot of  beds one day, go ahead and go big right from the start.</p>
<p><strong>Water</strong><br />
Of course, you&#8217;ll need access to water.</p>
<p><strong>Slope</strong><br />
Try to find a spot with 1.5% or less slope. Otherwise, plan to terrace  your garden to prevent the soil from washing away with the rain.</p>
<p><strong>Garden Design</strong><br />
There are countless ways to design your garden &#8212; from the practical to  the fanciful. Consider the following to determine your design.</p>
<p><strong>Row Gardens</strong><br />
Row gardens are what most people picture when they think of a garden.  Crops are planted in parallel lines, with space between each row. Easily  organized, row gardens can have lower yield than bed gardens and can  sprout more weeds.</p>
<p><strong>Raised Bed Gardens</strong><br />
Raised beds are just what they sound like &#8212; plots that are higher than  the surrounding land. In these gardens, all plants are grown together  without rows. The bed must be small enough that you can reach into it to  pull weeds and harvest your veggies.</p>

<p>This is a huge site. Go there and read and read and read. More next week.</p>
