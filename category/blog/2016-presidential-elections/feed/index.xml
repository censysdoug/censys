<p data-elm-loc="1">The round-the-clock security detail for Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt cost taxpayers almost $3.5 million during his first year in office, according to figures <a href="https://www.epa.gov/foia/administrators-security-detail-quarterly-payroll-costs">published</a> Friday by the agency.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="2">The EPA spent more than $2.7 million on agents’ salaries and roughly $760,00 on travel costs as part of that coverage, records released under the Freedom of Information Act show. The amount is <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-05/documents/psd_quarterly_payroll_costs_beginning_fy_2009_-_rev5-14-2018.pdf">nearly double</a> what taxpayers paid annually on average to provide security for Pruitt’s two immediate predecessors, Gina McCarthy and Lisa Jackson, during their tenures.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="3">Pruitt received 24-7 protection <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/05/14/scott-pruitt-requested-and-received-247-security-starting-on-his-first-day-at-epa/?utm_term=.2db5ee94f456">starting on his first day</a>, according to documents released earlier this month by the EPA’s inspector general. Then-senior White House adviser Don Benton first ordered the round-the-clock detail on Feb. 12 out of concern that President Trump’s controversial policies could make Pruitt a target, emails obtained by The Washington Post show, and then Pruitt opted to maintain that level of protection</p>

<h1>Coal, nuclear plant operator files for bankruptcy, asks Trump for a bailout</h1>

<p>On Saturday, power corporation FirstEnergy placed its coal and nuclear generation units <a href="https://cms.arstechnica.com/wp/wp-admin/post.php?post=226681&amp;action=edit">under chapter 11 bankruptcy</a>. Although coal and nuclear plants across the country have struggled to compete with the low prices of natural gas, FirstEnergy&#8217;s filing is unique because it stands to take on a political dimension. Just two days before FirstEnergy&#8217;s bankruptcy filing, the company petitioned the Department of Energy (DOE) for an emergency bailout, <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/firstenergy-asks-doe-for-emergency-action-to-save-pjm-coal-nuke-plants/520280/">citing concerns about reliability</a>.</p>

</div>
</aside>
<p>The petition could reinvigorate a debate started by Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/energy-secretary-proposes-rule-to-make-grid-managers-favor-coal-nuclear/">proposed a rule</a> last year to change how coal and nuclear plants are compensated for their power. The rule was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/federal-regulator-denies-rick-perrys-proposal-to-compensate-coal-nuclear/">denied by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</a> (FERC), which said that there was not enough evidence to justify changing how coal and nuclear are compensated.</p>
<p>FirstEnergy disparaged FERC&#8217;s decision in <a href="https://statepowerproject.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/fes-202c-application.pdf">its Thursday petition</a> (PDF), claiming that &#8220;as a result of FERC’s and the RTO&#8217;s [Regional Transmission Organization&#8217;s] failure to address this crisis, swift and decisive action is needed <em>now</em> to address this imminent loss of nuclear and coal-fired baseload generation and the threat to the electric grid that this loss poses&#8221; (emphasis FirstEnergy&#8217;s).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While this piece is important, it is also kind of cutsie in the fact that all the nuclear waste mentioned is well taken care of. Still I want to make 2 points.</p>
<p>1, I always thought and still do, that Yucca Mountain is a perfect place to store nuclear waste. I was pissed when Obama tried to call the whole thing off and I am glad that the Trump administration is trying to reopen it. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I do not like much of what Trump has done so far BUT this is just fine.</p>
<p>2, Illinois had the perfect opportunity to be the nations nuclear waste dump for real. Northern Illinois between Chicago and the Mississippi River is virtually earthquake free. Like for 1000s of years. As soon as Obama defunded Yucca Mountain we could have stepped up and said, &#8220;We will build it here&#8221;. Illinois could have gotten Billions of Dollars and 100s if not a 1000 jobs, and the waste would have had a very short train trip to disposal. They could have even used trucks. Then it would have been up to the rest of the States to figure out how to get their waste here.  But no, that would have been tooo bold, so now we are back to the beginning.</p>

<h1 class="post-title">Illinois Issues: The Prairie State&#8217;s Nuclear Waste Conundrum</h1>
<div class="by-date"><span class="submitted"><span class="submitted-label">By</span> <span class="name">Kevin McDermott</span></span> <i class="bullet">•</i> <span class="pub-date">Jul 20, 2017 </span></div>
<p><em><strong>The Land of Lincoln is the country&#8217;s largest de facto nuclear waste dump.</strong></em></p>
<p>Under a federal measure passed 30 years ago, the spent fuel from America’s nuclear reactors is supposed to be permanently buried out in the Mojave Desert, tucked deep under a mountain, far from any population center and easily guarded</p>
<p>In reality, though, that radioactive waste – tens of thousands of tons of it – is sitting in temporary storage at dozens of current and former nuclear power sites all over the country, as it has been for decades. The largest portion of it is divided among seven sites that dot the nation’s fifth-largest state: Illinois.</p>
<p>The story of how the Land of Lincoln became the nation&#8217;s biggest de facto nuclear waste dump is a tale of public fear, political pragmatism and the power of NIMBY (<em>Not In My Back Yard</em>).</p>
<p>It’s a story that radiates political irony. Among those responsible for Illinois’ atomic dilemma is the state’s favorite son, Barack Obama, who scuttled a decades-old project that was to have created a national nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.</p>

<h1 class="single-title">How Norway’s government made electric cars irresistible</h1>
<div class="meta"><em>May 29, 2017 at 6:35 PM EDT</em></div>
<p>In Scandinavia, which is a world leader in green technology, politicians and environmentalists want the president to follow their lead, and increase investment in environmentally friendly technologies like electric cars.</p>
<p>Special correspondent Malcolm Brabant reports from Norway, the world’s fastest growing electric car market.</p>
<p><strong>MALCOLM BRABANT:</strong> Norway prides itself on being one of the world’s most pristine countries. Yet, amid the stunning scenery, there are reminders that its vast wealth comes from decades of gas and oil production.</p>
<p>But Norwegians are turning their backs on fossil fuels and embracing electric cars like nowhere else.</p>
<p>Ann Kunish, who moved from Wisconsin 30 years ago, is one of the new converts.</p>
<p><strong>ANN KUNISH</strong>, Music Librarian: This car is a no-brainer. There’s no question about it. It’s very, very easy to choose electric cars. The Norwegian government has made it much more financially feasible to buy them. They don’t have the same fees, free parking in municipal spots. More and more charging stations are being built, lower yearly fee to use the roads, no tolls.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, I warned anybody who would listen, that Pres. Trump would finish off this planet and 5 days into he is guaranteeing that some of the dirtiest energy on the planet will be burnt (haha burned). Tar sands for God&#8217;s sake. What about leave it in the ground. Nah he wants to toss it up in the air. I am not saying I like McKibben, I do not. I mean on tactics. I think his analysis is right on.</p>

</div>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="372" data-total-count="372">IF you’re searching for a lens to understand just how President Trump sees the world, his executive orders on Tuesday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/us/politics/keystone-dakota-pipeline-trump.html">reviving the Keystone XL and expediting the Dakota Access pipelines</a> provide a sharply focused glimpse. In a word, he looks backward at all times. We’re beginning to get a better sense of what he means by “again” in “Make America Great Again.”</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="338" data-total-count="710">On questions of jobs and industry, he looks back at least to the 1950s. If something is big and made of steel, then it’s great. Like some Soviet Realist painter, Mr. Trump seems to have an image stuck in his head of brawny men building a nation. Those are real jobs, and all the other innovation in the economy doesn’t amount to much.</p>
<p>In fact (a phrase that suddenly seems politically charged) that’s not how economies work any more: If something is big and steel, it’s probably going to be run by robots. If the Keystone XL Pipeline is ever completed, for instance, it will employ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/07/us/obama-expected-to-reject-construction-of-keystone-xl-oil-pipeline.html">about 35 full-time workers</a>, relying for its operation on a vast network of sensors, drones and the like. The number of workers in our labor-intensive solar industry alone <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-solar-power-employs-more-people-more-oil-coal-gas-combined-donald-trump-green-energy-fossil-fuels-a7541971.html">now surpasses</a> those employed extracting coal, gas and oil combined</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Just imagine what he can do in 1,400 days. Go there and read.  More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I heard this on NPR and I just had to put it up here. I especially like that people like Bruce Rauner and Donald Trump are so out of touch with their base. But what does it say about the Democrats.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/california-republicans-are-5-times-more-likely-to-buy-solar-than-democrats">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/california-republicans-are-5-times-more-likely-to-buy-solar-than-democrats</a></p>
<h1 class="article-page-heading">California Republicans Are 5 Times More Likely to Own Solar Than Democrats</h1>
<div class="img-desc hidden-xs">
<p>Away from the national stage, the political divide on clean energy is not as wide as it appears.</p>
<div class="meta"><span class="by-info">by <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/authors/Julia+Pyper">Julia Pyper</a> </span><br />

</div>
<p>Republican voters and elected officials are generally considered hostile toward renewable energy. That’s likely because many prominent Republicans deny humanity’s contribution to climate change and oppose subsidies for clean energy technologies, despite the fact that fossil fuel industries benefit from <a href="http://priceofoil.org/content/uploads/2014/07/OCI_US_FF_Subsidies_Final_Screen.pdf" target="_blank">billions of dollars</a> in tax breaks.</p>
<p>Instances like the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-snowballs-chance/2015/03/01/46e9e00e-bec8-11e4-bdfa-b8e8f594e6ee_story.html?utm_term=.8fc73841dbd2" target="_blank">snowball toss</a> made by Republican Senator James Inhofe, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, coupled with his <a href="http://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/james-m-inhofe" target="_blank">record of voting</a> against clean energy legislation, help to cement the perception that conservatives widely oppose the adoption of low-carbon technologies like solar and wind.</p>
<p>This year’s GOP platform states, “We encourage the cost-effective development of renewable energy sources &#8212; wind, solar, biomass, biofuel, geothermal and tidal energy &#8212; by private capital.” However, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly bashed the clean energy sector, called climate change <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/yes-donald-trump-did-call-climate-change-chinese-h/" target="_blank">a hoax</a> created by the Chinese, and recently called the solar industry “<a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/09/26/a-disaster-trump-shuts-down-clintons-green-energy-claims/">a disaster</a>.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is not the point of the article but it IS my point. If most mammals, like us, are going to survive then we are going to have to leave all of the carbon that we can in the ground. By the way natural gas is no &#8220;bridge&#8221; to the future. Methane is a lot more potent green house gas. It is carbon that must be left in the ground too. So expect the natural gas companies to follow suit. The sooner the better.</p>

<h2>Peabody Energy, the world&#8217;s largest private-sector coal producer, filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday in a U.S. court, citing &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; industry pressures and a sharp decline in the price of coal.</h2>
<p>The company said it will continue to operate while in bankruptcy, while working to reduce debt and improve cash flow.</p>
<div id="ie_column"></div>
<p>&#8220;Peabody has a new management team, outstanding workforce, unmatched asset base and strong underlying operational performance that represent a key driver in the company&#8217;s future success,&#8221; CEO Glenn Kellow said in a statement announcing the Chapter 11 filing.</p>
<p>In addition to plummeting coal prices, the company cited weakness in China&#8217;s economy, overproduction of domestic shale gas and ongoing regulatory challenges as reasons for its declining prospects.</p>

<p class="post_meta"><span class="post_author_intro">by</span> <span class="post_author"><a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/author/john-laforge/" rel="nofollow">John Laforge</a></span></p>
<p>Hundreds of environmental and public interest groups, dozens of governmental bodies and thousands of concerned residents across the Great Lakes Basin have joined in rejecting a proposal by the giant utility company Ontario Power Generation (OPG) to bury 200,000 cubic meters of its radioactive waste on the eastern shore of Lake Huron, near its Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, in Kincardine, Ontario. The proposed dump is for so-called low- and intermediate-level radioactive wastes from the company’s 20 nuclear reactors. The site is 1.2 kilometers from Lake Huron on Bruce Peninsula.</p>
<p>On May 6, Canada’s Joint Review Panel submitted to Canada’s Ministry of Environment — the Honorable Leona Aglukkaq — its formal recommendation to approve the plan. Intervening parties have 120 days to submit comments on the JRP’s “environmental assessment” once its “conditions” have been made public. Aglukkaq will then make a recommendation to Ontario’s Premier, Kathleen Wynne, who will make the final decision about whether the dump should be constructed.</p>
<p>Most of the groups, legislators and cities opposing the so-called Deep Geologic Repository (regular folks call it a hole in the ground) have decided to ignore or to just parody the forthcoming “conditions” regulating the plan. A nit-picking analysis of them, they say, only gives the impression that permanent contamination of the Great Lakes somehow an acceptable risk under certain theoretical, computer-model-derived conditions. As Dr. Gordon Edwards, founder of Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility, said May 19 over the phone, “We reject any permanent abandonment of radioactive waste deep underground near the Great Lakes. And this project, at this time, under any conditions is absurd.”</p>

<h2>Temperature Increase</h2>
<div class="g-fulltext">“Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to <strong>pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C</strong> above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.”</div>

<div class="g-credit">Justin Gillis, climate science reporter:</div>
<div class="g-commentary">This agreement adopts a more ambitious target for limiting global warming than in the past by mentioning 1.5 degrees Celsius as part of the concrete goal to stay well below 2 degrees. If that were to be actually achieved, it would likely ward off some of the most severe effects of climate change. For example, although we don’t know the exact temperature, there is a trigger point at which the whole Greenland ice sheet and the West Antarctic ice sheet will melt. There is a chance that staying below 2 degrees Celsius would avoid that trigger point, and an even better chance if we stay below 1.5 degrees.</div>

<h2>Preservation of Forests</h2>
<div class="g-fulltext">“Parties are encouraged to take action to implement and support, including through results-based payments, the existing framework as set out in related guidance and decisions already agreed under the Convention for: policy approaches and positive incentives for activities relating to <strong>reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests</strong> and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries; and alternative policy approaches, such as joint mitigation and adaptation approaches for the integral and sustainable management of forests, while reaffirming the importance of incentivizing, as appropriate, non-carbon benefits associated with such approaches.”</div>

<p><span class="intro">Hamburg knew the bombs were coming,</span> and so the prisoners of war and forced laborers had just half a year to build the giant flak bunker. By July 1943 it was finished. A windowless cube of reinforced concrete, with seven-foot-thick walls and an even thicker roof, it towered like a medieval castle above a park near the Elbe River. The guns protruding from its four turrets would sweep Allied bombers from the sky, the Nazis promised, while tens of thousands of citizens sheltered safely behind its impenetrable walls.</p>
<p>Coming in at night from the North Sea just weeks after the bunker was finished, British bombers steered for the spire of St. Nikolai in the center of the city. They dropped clouds of metallic foil strips to throw off German radar and flak gunners. Targeting crowded residential neighborhoods, the bombers ignited an unquenchable firestorm that destroyed half of Hamburg and killed more than 34,000 people. Towering walls of fire created winds so strong that people were blown into the flames. Church bells clanged furiously.</p>
<p>The spire of St. Nikolai, which somehow survived, stands today as a <i>mahnmal—</i>a memorial reminding Germany of the hell brought by the Nazis. The flak bunker is another mahnmal. But now it has a new meaning: An urban development agency (IBA Hamburg) and the municipal utility (Hamburg Energie) have transformed it from a powerful reminder of Germany’s shameful past into a hopeful vision for the future.</p>
