<p>Anyone who has read here for long knows that I think the tar sands operations in Canada are crime against humanity. Everyone involved should be charged, tried convicted and put in jail. I personally believe it is worse than open air Nuclear Bomb Testing. Really!</p>

<p><span class="smartbody__lead-in">As the world’s</span> largest industrial project, the scale of Alberta’s tar sands operations is hard to grasp. Imagine driving on a highway and to either side behind a thin screen of trees is a vast industrial landscape as far as the eye can see. Now imagine 500 miles of that highway.</p>
</div>
<div class="parbase smartbody section text">
<p>If Alberta, with its population of four million people, was a country it would be the fifth largest oil producing nation. While it produces conventional oil, most comes from the Alberta oil sands, the world’s third largest proven oil reserve at 170 billion barrels.</p>
</div>
<div class="parbase smartbody section text">
<p>The local and national Canadian governments are pushing to expand oil extraction operations in the vast tar sands region, which already has a footprint roughly the size of England, even as they promote action on climate change on the world stage. And although the relationships between local people and the extraction operations are complex, involving jobs and services, a growing chorus of environmentalists and indigenous people are speaking out against pollution and degradation in the oil sands. Many are digging in for a fight against proposed expansions, including a major pipeline project.</p>

<p data-elm-loc="1">The round-the-clock security detail for Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt cost taxpayers almost $3.5 million during his first year in office, according to figures <a href="https://www.epa.gov/foia/administrators-security-detail-quarterly-payroll-costs">published</a> Friday by the agency.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="2">The EPA spent more than $2.7 million on agents’ salaries and roughly $760,00 on travel costs as part of that coverage, records released under the Freedom of Information Act show. The amount is <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-05/documents/psd_quarterly_payroll_costs_beginning_fy_2009_-_rev5-14-2018.pdf">nearly double</a> what taxpayers paid annually on average to provide security for Pruitt’s two immediate predecessors, Gina McCarthy and Lisa Jackson, during their tenures.</p>
<p data-elm-loc="3">Pruitt received 24-7 protection <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/05/14/scott-pruitt-requested-and-received-247-security-starting-on-his-first-day-at-epa/?utm_term=.2db5ee94f456">starting on his first day</a>, according to documents released earlier this month by the EPA’s inspector general. Then-senior White House adviser Don Benton first ordered the round-the-clock detail on Feb. 12 out of concern that President Trump’s controversial policies could make Pruitt a target, emails obtained by The Washington Post show, and then Pruitt opted to maintain that level of protection</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In other words they try to get out of their obligations by appearing to be generous. No Nuke has been built in the U.S. in 40 years because they are financial death traps. It takes a &#8220;modernizing&#8221; economy to support such a massive waste of time and money. And of course ignore safety concerns when regulation is lax. Now they want to give away a partially built plant. What the hell is North Carolina gonna do with that?</p>

<p>COLUMBIA — The parent company of South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co. is offering the site of a failed nuclear reactor project to the state-owned utility Santee Cooper.</p>
<p>SCANA has proposed giving the Fairfield County site to Santee Cooper so the project could be preserved and perhaps finished at some point in the future, The State newspaper reported.</p>
<p>SCE&amp;G and Santee Cooper abandoned their joint effort July 31 after spending more than $9 billion, both blaming the failure on the bankruptcy by principal contractor Westinghouse. SCE&amp;G customers have been charged nearly $2 billion toward interest on the company&#8217;s debt, via a series of rate hikes since 2009, without any power being generated.</p>

<h1 class="title">Florida Nuke Plant Did Not Meet Fed Safety Guidelines as Irma Roared</h1>
<div class="byline">By <span class="author"> <a class="author-name" href="http://www.newsweek.com/authors/melina-delkic" rel="author">Melina Delkic</a> </span> <time datetime="2017-09-11T22:01:15-04:00"> On 9/11/17 at 10:01 PM </time></div>
<p><em>Update</em> | Operators of a nuclear power plant in the path of Hurricane Irma kept one reactor operating during the cyclone, although the plant had not finished meeting stricter federal safety requirements implemented after Japan&#8217;s Fukushima accident.</p>
<p>The Turkey Point nuclear plant in Homestead, along the southeast Florida coast, experienced an unrelated failure in one reactor&#8217;s cooling system during the storm. A part called the steam generator&#8217;s feed regulating valve failed on Sunday night, prompting engineers to shut down the reactor.</p>
<p>The cooling system malfunction did not cause any radiation leakage, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p>
<p>The failure of the valve at Turkey Point was unrelated to larger, federally mandated improvements that are still pending, including improving seals on exterior doors and improving floodwater drainage mechanisms near &#8220;key&#8221; cooling pumps, according to a flood- and hurricane-preparedness report the power plant sent to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in June — a requirement of <a href="https://www.nei.org/Issues-Policy/Safety-and-Security/Fukushima-Response" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">post-Fukushima regulations</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>State utility regulators have approved a $137 million rate increase for power-grid upgrades on the Ameren Illinois system.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The 17.4 percent increase in electricity distribution rates, announced Wednesday by the Illinois Commerce Commission, take effect Jan. 1. Commissioners also approved a $245 million increase for system upgrades on the Commonwealth Edison system, serving Chicago and northern Illinois.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Ameren serves 1.2 million electric and 806,000 natural-gas customers in central and southern Illinois.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Commission chairman Doug Scott said in a statement the rates were set under the 2011 Energy Infrastructure Modernization Act, a state law that allowed Ameren and ComEd to recover annual costs for installation of smart grid technology such as high-tech meters, real-time pricing of electricity, more control options for consumers and more accurate energy data.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Scott said commissioners tried to balance the need for network improvements with long-term benefits to ratepayers.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am really shocked by this article. The idea that residential energy consumption could change so dramatically  in only 16 years is so amazing. Its like when we shifted to coal or later when we shifted to natural gas and then electricity. Only nobody is really talking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=10271">http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=10271</a></p>
<p><span class="date">March 7, 2013</span></p>
<h1><a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=10271#">Heating and cooling no longer majority of U.S. home energy use</a></h1>
<p>For decades, space heating and cooling (space conditioning) accounted for more than half of all residential energy consumption. Estimates from the most recent <a href="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2009/index.cfm?view=consumption">Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS)</a>, collected in 2010 and 2011 and released in 2011 and 2012, show that 48% of energy consumption in U.S. homes in 2009 was for heating and cooling, down from 58% in 1993. Factors underpinning this trend are increased adoption of more efficient equipment, better insulation, more efficient windows, and population shifts to warmer climates. The shift in how energy is consumed in homes has occurred even as per-household energy consumption has <a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=6570">steadily declined</a>.</p>
<p>While energy used for space conditioning has declined, energy consumption for appliances and electronics continues to rise. Although some appliances that are subject to federal efficiency standards, such as refrigerators and clothes washers, have become more efficient, the increased number of devices that consume energy in homes has offset these efficiency gains. Non-weather related energy use for appliances, electronics, water heating, and lighting now accounts for 52% of total consumption, up from 42% in 1993. The majority of devices in the fastest growing category of residential end-uses are powered by electricity, <a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=10251">increasing the total amount of primary energy needed to meet residential electricity demand</a>. As described in yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=10251">Today in Energy</a>, increased electricity use has a disproportionate effect on the amount of total primary energy required to support site-level energy use.</p>
<p>Other notable trends in household energy consumption include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average U.S. household consumed 11,320 kilowatthours (kWh) of electricity in 2009, of which the largest portion (7,526 kWh) was for appliances, electronics, lighting, and miscellaneous uses.</li>
<li>On average, residents living in homes constructed in the 1980s consumed 77 million Btu of total energy at home. By comparison, those living in newer homes, built from 2000 to 2009, consumed 92 million Btu per household, which is 19% more.</li>
<li>Space heating accounted for 63% of natural gas consumed in U.S. homes in 2009; the remaining 37% was for water heating, cooking, and miscellaneous uses.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am fresh out of thoughts on this subject. It all boils down to a decision that ever American has to make. Am I going to take power from the grid or not? If I am when and how? My answer is I would prefer to not get my power from the grid and if I must then as little as possible.</p>

<p>Summer Energy Tips</p>
<p>Summer and the high temperatures it brings can cause increased electrical loads. Keep cool this summer and save energy costs by following these simple tips around the house.</p>
<p>Summer cooling tips</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn off unnecessary lights. Much of the energy from a light bulb is heat.</li>
<li>Shut doors to unused rooms.</li>
<li>Make sure furniture or drapes do not block your registers for supply and return air.</li>
<li>Wear thin, loosely fitting clothes and you may not have to keep room temperatures as cool.</li>
<li>Keep the sun out of your house. Close blinds, shades or curtains during the hottest part of the day.</li>
<li>On mild days, open windows for natural ventilation and turn the air conditioning off.</li>
<li>Use portable or ceiling fans. Even mild air movement of 1-mph can make you feel 3-4° cooler.</li>
<li>Apply sun-control or other reflective films on south-facing windows.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/government-to-restrict-sales-and-marketing-around-smart-meters-3216.aspx">http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/government-to-restrict-sales-and-marketing-around-smart-meters-3216.aspx</a></p>
<h1>Government to restrict sales and marketing around smart meters</h1>
<div>Energy efficiency news – by GreenWise staff</div>
<div>5th April 2012</div>
<div id="ctl00_MainContent_ctl00_divSummary">Companies  are to face restrictions around how they sell and market their products  and around the data they can collect about their customers when mass  rollout of smart meters gets underway.</div>
<p>Under new guidelines proposed today by the <strong>Energy and Climate Change</strong> Minister Charles Hendry, all sales will be banned during the installation of <strong>smart meters </strong>and  installers will need the permission of customers before they visit if  they want to market any products to households and businesses. There  will be restrictions on data energy companies and other suppliers can  hold about their customers. And, in a bid to help consumers <a id="itxthook0" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/government-to-restrict-sales-and-marketing-around-smart-meters-3216.aspx#">save energy</a> and cut their bills, smart meter installers will have to provide <a title="click for latest energy efficiency news" href="http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/energy-efficiency.aspx">energy efficiency </a>advice  and all households will be offered an in-home display allowing them to  see what energy is being used and how much it is costing.</p>
<div>
The  Government wants 30 million homes and small businesses to have smart  meters installed by 2019. Smart meters give consumers access to accurate  information and mean they no longer have to rely on estimated bills.  But the cost of the rollout, set to start in 2014, has been estimated at  £11.7 billion and consumer groups are concerned the programme could  leave consumers short-changed and their privacy undermined.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#8217;t post these photos here because there are 67 of them and they are linked. So I will just post the text. I might add that if you skip down to photo 40 or so you will see the real damage to the power plant itself. Most of the pictures are of the temporary village that houses the workers, the drive to the power plant and and the emergency control room. This is probably because this is where the photographer spent the bulk of his time and was bored. They are real cool for the geeks like me. Thank you Denver Post.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.denverpost.com/captured/2011/11/14/inside-japans-fukushima-nuclear-reactor/5085/">http://blogs.denverpost.com/captured/2011/11/14/inside-japans-fukushima-nuclear-reactor/5085/</a></p>
<h1>Inside Japan’s Fukushima Nuclear Power Station</h1>
<p>Posted Nov 14, 2011</p>
<p>Associated Press photographer David Guttenfelder, along with other  reporters, was allowed inside the Fukushima nuclear power station to  witness the devastation, for the first time, caused by Japan’s March  12th earthquake and tsunami.<br />
Eight months later, the plant remains a shambles. Mangled trucks,  flipped over by the power of the wave, still clutter its access roads.  Rubble remains strewn where it fell. Pools of water cover parts of the  once immaculate campus.<br />
Tens of thousands of the plant’s former neighbors may never be able to  go home. And just as Hiroshima and Nagasaki become icons of the horrors  of nuclear weapons, Fukushima has become the new rallying cry of the  global anti-nuclear energy movement.<br />
Yet this picture is one of progress, Japanese officials say. It has  taken this long to make the plant stable enough to allow Saturday’s  tour, which included representatives of the Japanese and international  media — including The Associated Press. Officials expect to complete an  early but important step toward cleaning up the accident by the end of  the year. (AP)</p>
