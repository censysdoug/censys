										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A friend of mine, Nelson Oller, lives in Mason City Illinois and is in Ameren&#8217;s service territory. They have a whole house approach to reducing their residential customers electricity consumption. This program is great. They are helping with insulation and state-of-the-art equipment. He has to spent 2 grand for 10 thousand dollars worth of stuff. One of the thinks he was telling me about was a vent fan for the bathroom that could act as a whole house plan. I had never herd of such a thing, but according to this article it has been around for several years now.</p>

<h1 class="title">Bathroom Exhaust Fans</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">Bath fans help remove odors and moisture — and can be used in some homes to satisfy whole-house ventilation requirements</h3>
<div>Posted on Aug 7 2014 by Martin Holladay</div>
<div></div>
<div>Older homes often lack bathroom exhaust fans. In the old days, if the bathroom was smelly or steamy, you were supposed to open a window to air it out.</div>
<p>This isn’t a very logical ventilation method, especially when temperatures are below zero, or when the weather is 90°F and humid. Yet this time-honored method of bathroom ventilation is still enshrined in our building codes. According to the 2009 International Residential Code (sections R303.3 and M1507.3), a bathroom with an operable window does not need to have a bath exhaust fan.</p>
<h3>Why do we need exhaust fans?</h3>
<p>In spite of the code’s archaic loophole, builders should install an exhaust fan in every bathroom or toilet room — even when the bathroom has a window.</p>
<p>A bath exhaust fan can perform several functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can exhaust smelly air, allowing fresher air to enter the bathroom.</li>
<li>It can exhaust humid air, allowing dryer air to enter the bathroom.</li>
<li>When operated for 24 hours per day or when controlled by a timer, it can act (in some cases) as the most important component of a whole-house ventilation system.</li>
</ul>
<div>Designing an exhaust-only ventilation system is a topic unto itself, and is beyond the scope of this article. For more information on exhaust-only ventilation systems, see <a href="http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/musings/designing-good-ventilation-system">Designing a Good Ventilation System</a>.</p>
<h3>Where does the makeup air come from?</h3>
<p>When the bathroom door is closed and the fan is operating, where is the makeup air coming from?</p>
<p>If the bathroom has an exterior wall, some of the makeup air is coming from the exterior — for example, through leaks around the window or baseboard.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To Not talk about how disastrous Trump&#8217;s Presidency will be for the environment and the energy industry I decided to return to my roots in the residential market. Todays article is a bit old but its message is timeless. We have been concentrating on single devices like furnaces, refrigerators, windows seen as a whole instead of a holistic approach to a house.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-real-problem-with-energy-efficiency">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-real-problem-with-energy-efficiency</a></p>
<h1 class="article-page-heading">We’re Doing Residential Energy Efficiency All Wrong</h1>
<div class="img-desc hidden-xs">
<p>Nate Adams says radical changes are needed in the home-performance business.</p>
<div class="meta"><span class="by-info">by Nate Adams<br />
September 08, 2015 </span></div>
</div>
<p>Utilities are now spending nearly <a href="http://sheltongrp.com/7-billion-later/">$7 billion a year</a> on energy-efficiency programs. It seems we have little to show for it aside from expensive consultants who will model any results you would like.</p>
<p>These programs tend to focus their marketing on the energy savings or money savings from the projects. Consumers don’t care. If they did, we would see geometric growth instead of a resounding &#8220;meh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others focus on better financing products, slicker sales pitches, faster energy audits, higher rebates or any of a myriad of other things.</p>
<p>In the residential sector, none of these are the problem. The lack of sales is the problem.</p>
<p>Projects are not being sold and implemented in substantial numbers. We need to slow it down, build relationships with consumers and educate them, learn and think systemically about the problems they have, and arrive at solutions that fit homeowner budgets.</p>

<p class="descender" data-wc="134">     Mark and Sara Borkowski live with their two young daughters in a century-old, fifteen-hundred-square-foot house in Rutland, Vermont. Mark drives a school bus, and Sara works as a special-ed teacher; the cost of heating and cooling their house through the year consumes a large fraction of their combined income. Last summer, however, persuaded by Green Mountain Power, the main electric utility in Vermont, the Borkowskis decided to give their home an energy makeover. In the course of several days, coördinated teams of contractors stuffed the house with new insulation, put in a heat pump for the hot water, and installed two air-source heat pumps to warm the home. They also switched all the light bulbs to L.E.D.s and put a small solar array on the slate roof of the garage.</p>
<p data-wc="117">The Borkowskis paid for the improvements, but the utility financed the charges through their electric bill, which fell the very first month. Before the makeover, from October of 2013 to January of 2014, the Borkowskis used thirty-four hundred and eleven kilowatt-hours of electricity and three hundred and twenty-five gallons of fuel oil. From October of 2014 to January of 2015, they used twenty-eight hundred and fifty-six kilowatt-hours of electricity and no oil at all. President Obama has announced that by 2025 he wants the United States to reduce its total carbon footprint by up to twenty-eight per cent of 2005 levels. The Borkowskis reduced the footprint of their house by eighty-eight per cent in a matter of days, and at no net cost.</p>

<h1>World&#8217;s largest solar plant goes live, will provide power for 1.1M people</h1>
<h2>Up to 11% of the world&#8217;s electricity could come from concentrated solar by 2050</h2>
<p>The world&#8217;s largest solar power plant, now live in Morocco, will eventually provide 1.1 million people with power and cut carbon emissions by 760,000 tons a year.</p>
<p>The $9 billion Noor Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plant could eventually start exporting energy to the European market.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2016/02/04/worlds-largest-concentrated-solar-plant-opened-in-morocco" target="new">Noor Concentrated Solar Power</a> (CSP), paid for with funds approved by <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/" target="new">The World Bank,</a> is located in the Souss-Massa-Drâa area in Morocco, about 6 miles from Ouarzazate town. It began operation on Thursday. While the World Bank and other development partners provided financial support, the Noor solar plant is a wholly Moroccan project.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this bold step toward a clean energy future, Morocco is pioneering a greener development and developing a cutting edge solar technology,&#8221; Marie Francoise Marie-Nelly, World Bank Country Director for the Maghreb, said in a statement. &#8220;The returns on this investment will be significant for the country and its people, by enhancing energy security, creating a cleaner environment, and encouraging new industries and job creation</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I saw a story on Digg about a designer (architect?) that got an award for building a house with water walls. But I could not find it again. This piece popped up and uses an older technology but you can get the idea from it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/green-homes/build-a-water-wall-home-zmaz83ndzale.aspx">http://www.motherearthnews.com/green-homes/build-a-water-wall-home-zmaz83ndzale.aspx</a></p>
<h1>Build a Water-Wall Home</h1>
<p><em> Construct your very own water-wall home and learn about calculating water storage requirements, wall construction and solar basics. </em></p>
<div class="HeaderControl">By David Bainbridge<br />
November/December 1983</div>
<p>The Morgan home in Davis, California has 14,000 pounds of thermal mass stored in its water walls, yet the containers blend in so well with the house design that they&#8217;re barely visible.</p>
<p>In many ways, <em>passive</em> solar homes are superior to those with <em>active</em> (mechanically assisted) heating and cooling systems. After all, passive solar systems don&#8217;t rely on auxiliary energy sources to perform (so they&#8217;ll work even when the power is off)&#8230; are generally simple and low in cost, combine energy collection and storage functions, have a long life, need little maintenance, and can often be built and installed by the home handy person, without special training or equipment.</p>
<p>But precisely because such &#8220;non-moving&#8221; systems have no pumps or controls to circulate warm or cool air, they typically rely on one key element: the <em>thermal mass</em> that stores and gives off absorbed heat or cold. A number of different items can be used to provide this energy-holding capacity, but just about the most effective and economical &#8220;To a water wall (a term that is a shorthand way of saying &#8220;contained water for thermal mass in passive solar homes&#8221;).</p>

<p>The Petra Nova Carbon Capture Project, a joint venture between NRG and JX Nippon Oil &amp; Gas Exploration in Japan, will be the largest in the world to use a process that scrubs away the carbon dioxide after coal has been burned to produce electricity, the companies said.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide, the <a href="http://www2.epa.gov/carbon-pollution-standards/learn-about-carbon-pollution-power-plants#what">primary greenhouse gas</a>, would vent into the atmosphere and contribute to climate change if it’s not removed beforehand.</p>
<p>“This project is such a game changer because  it acts like a bridge between the power and oil industry,” said Arun Banskota, president of NRG’s carbon capture group. “Carbon dioxide is something we need to increasingly manage. There is a huge shortage for carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I mean really if they are going to drop their insistence on solar panel installations as part of a retrofit then why keep the name? Are they now a software company or are they now a software and then install whatever company? Good questions with no answers. It would be like Tide if it were to stop making soap and started making dishwashers. Would they keep the name and why?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/a-peak-at-solarcitys-new-energy-efficiency-software?">http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/a-peak-at-solarcitys-new-energy-efficiency-software?</a></p>
<h1>Has SolarCity Created the Amazon 1-Click for Energy Efficiency?</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We believe SolarCity has the best database of residential energy use of anyone in the world.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Stephen Lacey: June 28, 2013</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After SolarCity shifted its energy efficiency strategy and pulled back from doing residential retrofits in-house, the solar services behemoth is moving straight into <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/intelligent-efficiency-innovations-reshaping-the-energy-efficiency-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intelligent efficiency</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GTM&#8217;s Eric Wesoff recently reported on SolarCity&#8217;s <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/SolarCity-Shifts-Its-Home-Efficiency-Strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolving</a> business plan and the <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Can-SolarCity-Scale-Energy-Efficiency-Services-Like-Solar-Roofs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resulting changes</a> that company executives say will scale residential efficiency in the same way solar services have <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/us-residential-solar-financing-to-reach-5.7-billion-by-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scaled residential solar</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But solar is very different from efficiency. For the most part, solar is very standardized and installations are uniform from home to home. Efficiency retrofits encompass an extraordinarily broad category of activities and skills. Incentives are also quite different for efficiency, making it more complicated from a financial perspective. That&#8217;s why <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/are-solar-companies-equipped-to-get-into-energy-efficiency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only a handful</a> of U.S. solar contractors have offered efficiency as an in-house service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SolarCity decided that doing the retrofit work itself was not the best way to scale. Instead, it has turned from manpower to the power of big data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The secret sauce is a &#8220;simulation engine&#8221; that shows homeowners exactly how much they&#8217;re spending on energy everywhere in their house. The initial database was created using information from 16,000 home energy audits performed over the last five years. It relies on an algorithm developed at the Department of Energy that crunches 100 million calculations per home for each individual energy efficiency audit (which is still performed by SolarCity when installing solar).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The simulation software looks at every component in a home in relation to one another,&#8221; said SolarCity COO Peter Rive. &#8220;Every ten minutes, it thinks about what one thing is doing and about its effect on the rest of the systems within the home.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes I know there are many things that are wrong about Las Vegas. People shouldn&#8217;t even be there in the first place. The rape of the river that no longer reaches the sea. The rape of the pristine desert and the death of many Native Americans. I lived there for a year and there is also the cheesy nature of the culture. But when they do something right, you got to give them credit.</p>

<h1>Nevada Energy Star Partners Demonstrate Peak Performance (Web Only)</h1>
<div>BY <a href="http://www.homeenergy.org/list/author/id/946">ANNETTE BUBAK</a></div>
<div>September 01, 2012</div>
<p>Las Vegas may appear balmy and inviting with its sparkling pools and  swaying palm trees, but those who live in Neon City know the truth: It’s  too cold in the winter and too hot in the summer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, hundreds of thousands of homes that were built during  an amazing 50 years of rapid growth in the Southwest do not incorporate  modern advances in energy performance to accommodate the wild swings of  desert climate. As temperatures climb to 110°F in the summer, many homes  leak large amounts of cooled air through gaps in ducts, roofs, windows,  and doors. And when the frigid north wind drops the temperature below  freezing in the winter, heated air escapes, leaving living rooms and  bedrooms uncomfortably cold and drafty. While Las Vegans know their  climate, they may not realize that they are paying to heat and cool the  great outdoors.</p>
<p>The dramatic temperature shifts in the high-desert climate make Las  Vegas an ideal place for homeowners who are looking to make their homes  more comfortable and to save substantially on their energy bills. Funded  in part by DOE’s Building America program, the Building America  Retrofit Alliance is working with the Nevada ENERGY STAR Partners–Green  Alliance (NESP–Green Alliance), and with Better Building Performance, a  Las Vegas company, to upgrade two typical homes top to bottom. Their  goal has been to show homeowners and remodelers how easy and effective  energy performance upgrades can be.</p>

<p>The FHFA believes that an unintended consequence of obtaining a PACE  loan is to increase the risk of mortgage default.  The FHFA’s  logic is  that if the green investments are not capitalized into home prices then  the home owner’s equity decreases as equity =  sales price – debt owed.    Under these assumptions, the green investment doesn’t raise the sales  price but does increase the debt owed. My recent research convinces me  that this pessimism is false.  Here is  <a href="http://legalplanet.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/letter_fhfa3.pdf">My letter to the FHFA.</a> Here is my July 2012 peer viewed paper on solar panel capitalization effects in San Diego and Sacramento   <a href="http://legalplanet.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/dastrup-zivin-costa-and-kahn.pdf">dastrup-zivin-costa-and-kahn</a> .</p>
<p>We need more regulatory scholarship focused on empirical work and  hypothesis testing.  I have an incentive to say this because that is  what I do.</p>

<h1>The Ivanpah Solar Project Named 2012 Energy Project of the Year</h1>
<p>April 24, 2012</p>
<h3>Project recognized for its innovative approach, job creation and scale of clean energy production</h3>
<p><strong>(LOS ANGELES, Calif.) April 24, 2012</strong> – NRG Energy, Google, BrightSource Energy and EPC partner Bechtel announced that the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System (Ivanpah SEGS) received the 2012 Energy Project of the Year Award by the USC CMAA Green Symposium. Ivanpah SEGS in California’s Mojave Desert is currently the world’s largest concentrating solar power (CSP) plant under construction. When completed, it will nearly double the amount of solar thermal electricity produced in the US.</p>
<p>“The sheer magnitude of the Ivanpah project is reinforcing California&#8217;s position as the leader of renewable energy in the United States,” said Caroline Fletcher, USC Green Symposium Co-Chair. “The project has demonstrated an innovative approach to partnerships and is significantly contributing to job creation in the region. We’re very pleased to honor this important project with our 2012 Energy Project of the Year Award.”</p>
<p>“Ivanpah is a flagship project, widely recognized for its environmentally-responsible design, and lauded for its role in helping to grow Southern California’s High Desert economy,” said Joe Desmond, SVP of Government Relations and Communications, BrightSource Energy. “We look forward to completing this important solar power facility and help California meet its economic and clean energy goals.”</p>
<p>“We are pleased to be a part of this award-winning project. The innovation applied to the engineering and construction of Ivanpah will help advance the renewable energy industry and make solar energy a viable option for more people,” said Jim Ivany, president of renewable power at Bechtel.</p>
