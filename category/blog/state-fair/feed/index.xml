										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Climatologists and weather people are always nattering on about how you can&#8217;t link global warming and a &#8220;particular&#8217; WEATHER EVENT. Well I say that is super silly. This last hurricane to hit the Philippines (one of 4 already this season) was caused by global warming. I mean come on, the most powerful storm ever to strike land. When do adjectives like that add up to &#8211; caused by. Does the next biggest &#8220;ever&#8221; storm = global warming. Does a year of the &#8220;biggest&#8221; storms ever = global warming. Really when can I drop the parenthesis around all the adjectives and just say it out loud. Well I believe today is the day.</p>
<p><a href="http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/521536/20131112/climate-change-warsaw-global-warming-typhoon-haiyan.htm#.UoJYfOInN5r">http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/521536/20131112/climate-change-warsaw-global-warming-typhoon-haiyan.htm#.UoJYfOInN5r</a></p>
<h1>Climate Change Talks: Philippine Representative in Tears Over Haiyan, Receives Standing Ovation</h1>
<p><strong>By <a class="article_writtenby" style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://au.ibtimes.com/archives/articles/reporters/reissa-su/">Reissa Su</a> </strong> | November 12, 2013 7:51 PM EST</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Typhoon Haiyan has dampened the spirits of climate change negotiators in an international talk on global climate change treaty in Warsaw. Delegates from around the world quickly suggested that the monster typhoon that wreaked havoc in the Philippines was enhanced by global warming.</span></p>
<div class="content2 KonaBody" style="font-size: 12px;">
<p>Typhoon Haiyan has left Vietnam and is now on its way to <span class="tpk"><a href="http://au.ibtimes.com/topics/detail/227/china/">China</a></span> at a reduced strength. The super storm has displaced over 600,000 families in the Philippines  leaving most of Tacloban City devastated.</p>
<p>Lead negotiator for an alliance of small island nations Olai Ngedikes said that Typhoon Haiyan should be a &#8220;stark reminder&#8221; of the lack of action among governments in the world. He said the typhoon should motivate climate change negotiators to push an agreement in Warsaw.</p>
<p>Philippine representative to the UN climate change talks, Naderev Sano said he would fast or refrain from eating in solidarity with typhoon victims or until a meaningful solution will be reached. Mr Sano said the effect of climate change is madness. He added they can put an end to the madness by arriving at an agreement in Warsaw.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The reason this Post is so late in the day is because I opened my web browser today and it showed that I had 35 messages waiting for me. Someone had unleashed a worm on my address book and it was busy sending all my friends spam. Some of it dangerous spam. I was mortified. I spent over 2 hours checking to make sure it was originating on my computer. People sent some of it back to me so I could see what the heck was spewing out of my account. Then in consultation with my computer expert Afredo I determined that just changing my email password could halt the attack&#8230;So I did and it ended. I had to blow off lunch with David Lasley, Dave Fuchs and the Sangamon County Democrats just to get to here&#8230;Damnit.</p>
<p>There were some things that I saw at the Illinois State Fair that I did not really care for. One of those things was the prominence of Biofuel in both of  Governor Pat Quinn&#8217;s tents. We all know that biofuel, especially ones made from foods, distract people from getting rid of the internal combustion engine. It also drives up food prices so this:</p>
<p><a title="fairs4.jpg" href="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/fairs4.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/fairs4.jpg" alt="fairs4.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>and this:</p>
<p><a title="fairs81.jpg" href="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/fairs81.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/fairs81.jpg" alt="fairs81.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>were NOT appreciated.</p>
<p>Though the latest craze in biofuels is watermellons that are farm waste:</p>

<p><!-- ## ARTICLE --><strong>Aug. 26, 2009</strong> &#8212; A staple of backyard barbecues and summer time snacks, watermelon is also a promising new source of <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2009/07/08/urine-power.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">renewable energy</a>.</p>
<p>According to a new study, leftover watermelons from farms&#8217; harvests could be converted into up to 9.4 million liters (2.5 million gallons) of clean, renewable ethanol fuel every year destined for your car, truck, or airplane&#8217;s gas tank.</p>
<p>Agriculturally, <a href="http://home.howstuffworks.com/watermelon.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watermelon</a> is a peculiar fruit &#8212; each year farmers across the country leave between 20 and 40 percent of their crop to rot on the ground. These are the ugly ducklings of the lot; though perfectly fine on the inside, the misshapen or blemished melons simply won&#8217;t sell at the grocery store.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a crow lands on a melon, takes two pecks at the rind, and then flies away, it&#8217;s no good,&#8221; Wayne Fish of the United States Department of Agriculture in Lane, Oklahoma said. &#8220;I had farmers telling me, &#8216;I&#8217;m leaving one-fifth of my melons on the land. Is there anything I can do with them?'&#8221;</p>
<p>Across the United States, he estimated that 360,000 tons of watermelons spoil in fields every year.</p>
<p>Some local growers wondered whether the waste melons could be <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/06/16/kudzu-biofuel-ethanol.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turned into ethanol</a>, the clean-burning fuel derived from plant sugars. In a series of new experiments published yesterday in the journal <em>Biotechnology for Biofuels</em>, Fish and a team of researchers showed that they can.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, watermelon juice may turn out to be the perfect way to optimize industrial-scale production of ethanol from corn, molasses and sugar cane.</p>

<p>Then there was this. What the hell. This causes Earth Quakes in Texas yet it makes it to the State Fair?</p>

<h1 class="head">Drilling Eyed as Possible Culprit Behind Texas Earthquakes</h1>
<p>Sunday, June      14, 2009  					 						<img decoding="async" class="byline" src="http://www.foxnews.com/images/service_ap_36.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p><span id="intelliTXT"><strong>CLEBURNE, Texas  —  <span style="font-family: Arial;">The earth moved here on June 2. It was the first recorded earthquake in this Texas town&#8217;s 140-year history — but not the last.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">There have been four small earthquakes since, none with a magnitude greater than 2.8. The most recent ones came Tuesday night, just as the City Council was meeting in an emergency session to discuss what to do about the ground moving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The council&#8217;s solution was to hire a geology consultant to try to answer the question on everyone&#8217;s mind: Is natural gas drilling — which began in earnest here in 2001 and has brought great prosperity to Cleburne and other towns across North Texas — causing the quakes?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">&#8220;I think John Q. Public thinks there is a correlation with drilling,&#8221; Mayor Ted Reynolds said. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t had a quake in recorded history, and all the sudden you drill and there are earthquakes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">At issue is a drilling practice called &#8220;fracking,&#8221; in which water is injected into the ground at high pressure to fracture the layers of shale and release natural gas trapped in the rock.</span></p>
<p><!-- QUIGO --> <!-- QUIGO --><span style="font-family: Arial;">There is no consensus among scientists about whether the practice is contributing to the quakes. But such seismic activity was once rare in Texas and seems to be increasing lately, lending support to the theory that drilling is having a destabilizing effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">On May 16, three small quakes shook Bedford, a suburb of Dallas and Fort Worth. Two small earthquakes hit nearby Grand Prairie and Irving on Oct. 31, and again on Nov. 1.</span></p>

<p>They show up with a vengeance. In all fairness (HAHA) I think some of them are mandated to show up. Again I was disappointed that I did not make it to the Illinois Building for Seniors day because IDENR puts on a great energy conservation display. I also did not make it to the Conservation area so I can not run a picture of the Oil Well like I do each year, nor did I get a chance to buy a TShirt from DENR if their stand was open this year. That said&#8230;The Governor had 2 tents and they covered the gambit:</p>

<p>First there was the U of I&#8217;s Sustainable Technology Center. They claim to have served Illinois since 1985. I got my doubts about that but&#8230;.</p>

<p>and I went to  the Illinois State Fair</p>

<p>To see the Butter Cow.</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s fair was really weird weather wise. It rained when Cathy and I normally go on Monday and Tuesday &#8211; Senior&#8217;s Day and Agriculture Day respectively. So by the time we made it on Friday most everything was gone. Embarrassingly we did not make it to Conservation World where all the cool kids and our friends hang out. We did make it to the Expo Building where home efficiency seemed to be the order of the day:</p>

<p>We met this nice man from Energy Doctor. A business that offers to tighten your envelop and use other measures as a package to reduce your energy consumption. They started in Iowa but have 5 offices now. Please visit them at:</p>

<p>Having exhausted ourselves we went across the street to Mehan&#8217;s food stand and got a corn dog and a lemon shake up. They are celebrating 75 years at the Illinois State Fair&#8230;Congratulations</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was so tempted to post them but I swore that for the first time in 2 years I would take a break. Tomorrow I may even post some vacation photos (shock) and we will be going to the State Fair so there will be pictures of that too (awe). Maybe if you are lucky a picture of the Butter Cow. Anyway in a nutshell here are some of the things I missed:</p>

<p>WILLIAMSVILLE — Ron Semplowski of Gillespie has been laid off three times in the last four years.</p>
<p>Friday, Semplowski and three members of his extended family who also are unemployed drove an hour to Williamsville for a jobs fair for the Shay No. 1 coal mine that will operate out of the former Monterey coal mine facilities in Macoupin County between Carlinville and Gillespie.More than 50 applicants showed up by 9 a.m., according to the company.</p>
<p>“We drove 65 miles, and the mine is probably two miles from my house,” Semplowski said.  Rodney Rosentreter, who is also from Gillespie, said: “None of us has experience in coal mining, but we have other job experiences.”  Such jobs, said the Semplowski and Rosentreter family members, have included work with automotive, insulation and pork-producing companies.</p>

<hr class="m5v" />More than 80 jobs at Ameren Corp. power plants in Illinois will be eliminated by the spring of next year as the poor economy continues to drive down demand for electricity, the company announced Wednesday.The cuts include 47 jobs at the Meredosia power plant, approximately 60 miles northwest of Springfield. Wednesday’s announcement came three weeks after the company announced it would cut 55 jobs in its Illinois energy marketing operations.Laid-off workers will be offered transfers, if possible, or severance packages and job-search assistance, according to the company.</p>
<p>“While we regret having to take this action, the challenges we face demand a new model for our merchant generation business. We must build a leaner, more streamlined organization that can more effectively compete in today’s difficult economy where we see much lower prices for our power,” said a statement from Chuck Naslund, president and CEO of Ameren Energy Resources Co.</p>
<p>Naslund said the company also has cut about $1 billion worth of construction projects that had been planned from 2010 to 2013.</p>

<hr class="m5v" /> 				  				A group of Sangamon County residents plans to file petitions this week asking that developers of a commercial wind farm be required to put greater distance between turbines and non-participating property owners.Approximately 450 signatures have been collected for submission to the county board and a county zoning appeals board, Cathy Bomke of Sangamon County Citizens for Wind Rights said Monday.The petitions ask that the current 1,200-foot setback requirement from the property of non-participating landowners be increased to a mile, although Bomke said the mile figure is open to discussion.</p>
<p>“One mile is where we started based on research on health, safety and property values. It’s not cut in stone. It’s a starting point for us,” Bomke said.</p>
<p>Bomke said a few petitions still must counted, but that the group hopes to file the request as early as Wednesday.</p>
<p>“What we’re asking for is a simple review of the setbacks. We’re not trying to stop anything here,” Bomke said.</p>
<p>American Wind Energy Management Corp. continues signing up property owns and conducting tests for the Meridian Wind Farm, a utility-scale project that in the first phase would have as many as 200 turbines in an area roughly between New Berlin and Pleasant Plains.</p>

<p>I know, I know&#8230;during the winter you can gather all that heat and store in something like a Trombe Wall but then you get into all this summer winter trade offs. You end up having to &#8220;shut off&#8221; the windows in the summer. There is a natural lighting argument and I am sure that in a work environment there is a health factor in there too. For homes however you can supply the light with light tunnels and avoid the solar load. Again health wise, if you want to feel one with nature &#8211; Go for a walk.</p>

<p><a href="http://digg.com/science">http://digg.com/science</a></p>
<h2>Energy Efficiency Could Save U.S. a Whopping $1.2 Trillion</h2>
<p><strong>A new report finds that the low-hanging fruit of energy efficiency is the &#8220;single most promising resource&#8221; in pursuing energy affordability and security. </strong></p>
<p>In addition to the tremendous savings potential for consumers and businesses, <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/electricpowernaturalgas/downloads/US_energy_efficiency_full_report.pdf" class="external-link">the report <span class="external-link"> </span></a> (pdf), by the global consulting firm <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/clientservice/electricpowernaturalgas/" class="external-link">Mckinsey and Company <span class="external-link"> </span></a>, finds that elevating energy efficiency to a national priority could also spur the creation of 600,000-900,000 long-term green jobs and reduce our overall energy consumption by 23 percent.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.celsias.com/admin/articles/article/add/"><img decoding="async" src="http://www.celsias.com/media/uploads/admin/cfl_450_sharp.jpg" alt="cfl" align="left" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>What are the implications of the above findings? Energy efficiency is an enormous (and enormously cheap) energy resource for the U.S., &#8220;but only if the nation can craft a comprehensive and innovative approach to unlock it.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of those barriers is seed money; the $1.2 trillion wouldn&#8217;t come for free. The investment, according to the report&#8217;s authors, would be about $522 billion over the next ten years, not including program implementation. But an investment of that scale could slash energy consumption in 2020 by 9.1 quadrillion BTUs, or 23% of projected demand, potentially avoiding up to 1.1 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions annually.</p>
<p>Mckinsey and Company found that substantial gains in efficiency could be made by:</p>
<p>1. Recognizing true potential of energy efficiency and prioritizing;<br />
2. Encouraging old as well as new approaches to efficiency at both national and regional levels;<br />
3. Identifying ways to provide the upfront funding for energy efficiency plans and programs;<br />
4. Building collaborative processes with utilities, regulators, government agencies, manufacturers and consumers, and;<br />
5. Fostering innovation in the development and deployment of energy efficiency technologies to sustain ongoing productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Overcoming Significant and Persistent Barriers</strong></p>
<p>To unlock the potential outlined in the report, &#8220;significant and persistent barriers&#8221; need to be addressed to spur demand for energy efficiency and adopt wide-ranging energy management systems and practices. Sounds easy enough, right? Not so fast, say the report&#8217;s authors.</p>
<p>First off, the easiest gains in energy efficiency have already been made and much of the low-hanging fruit has already been picked. Since 1980, energy consumption per unit of floor space has decreased 11% in the residential sector, 21% in the commercial sector and 41% in the industrial sector. But while significant advancements have been made, the report strongly suggests we are not done &#8212; largely because of the persistent social, structural and institutional barriers.</p>

<p>BASEL, Switzerland — Markus O. Häring, a former oilman, was a hero in this city of medieval cathedrals and intense environmental passion three years ago, all because he had drilled a hole three miles deep near the corner of Neuhaus Street and Shafer Lane.</p>

<p><script type="text/JavaScript" language="JavaScript">if (acm.rc) acm.rc.write();</script> He was prospecting for a vast source of clean, renewable energy that seemed straight out of a <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/v/jules_verne/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Jules Verne.">Jules Verne</a> novel: the heat simmering within the earth’s bedrock.</p>
<p>All seemed to be going well — until Dec. 8, 2006, when the project set off an earthquake, shaking and damaging buildings and terrifying many in a city that, as every schoolchild here learns, had been devastated exactly 650 years before by a quake that sent two steeples of the Münster Cathedral tumbling into the Rhine.</p>
<p>Hastily shut down, <a href="http://www.geothermal.ch/" title="Web site for Geothermal Explorers International Ltd.">Mr. Häring’s project</a> was soon forgotten by nearly everyone outside Switzerland. As early as this week, though, an American start-up company, <a href="http://www.altarockenergy.com/">AltaRock Energy</a>, will begin using nearly the same method to drill deep into ground laced with fault lines in an area two hours’ drive north of San Francisco.</p>
<p>Residents of the region, which straddles Lake and Sonoma Counties, have already been protesting swarms of smaller earthquakes set off by a less geologically invasive set of energy projects there. AltaRock officials said that they chose the spot in part because the history of mostly small quakes reassured them that the risks were limited.</p>
<p>Like the effort in Basel, the new project will tap <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/geothermal_power/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="Recent and archival news about geothermal power.">geothermal</a> energy by fracturing hard rock more than two miles deep to extract its heat. AltaRock, founded by Susan Petty, a veteran geothermal researcher, has secured more than $36 million from the Energy Department, several large venture-capital firms, including Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, and <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/google_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More information about Google Inc">Google</a>. AltaRock maintains that it will steer clear of large faults and that it can operate safely.</p>
<p>But in a report on seismic impact that AltaRock was required to file, the company failed to mention that the Basel program was shut down because of the earthquake it caused. AltaRock claimed it was uncertain that the project had caused the quake, even though Swiss government seismologists and officials on the Basel project agreed that it did. Nor did AltaRock mention the thousands of smaller earthquakes induced by the Basel project that continued for months after it shut down.</p>
<p>The California project is the first of dozens that could be operating in the United States in the next several years, driven by a push to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases and the Obama administration’s support for renewable energy.</p>

Reported today, Australia opens the second round of the Geothermal Drilling Program with “The Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson AM MP inviting geothermal companies to submit applications for funding under Round 2 of the A$50 million (US$39.8 million) Geothermal Drilling Program, which opened today.</p>
<p>Round 2 funding will provide grants of up to A$7 million (US$5.6 million) on a matching-funding basis to support the drilling of deep geothermal wells and help finance geothermal proof-of-concept projects.<br />
Geothermal energy producers pump water below ground (sometimes as deep as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles)), where it is heated by ‘hot rocks’. The heat energy is then used to generate electricity.</p>
<p>Ferguson said: “Geoscience Australia estimates that if just one per cent of Australia’s geothermal energy was extracted it would equate to 26,000 times Australia’s total annual energy consumption. “Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source with enormous potential in Australia; however, the Government recognizes technical development costs are high.</p>
<p>“The Australian Government is pleased to be able to support drilling at the first stage of development as part of its A$4.5 billion (US$3.5 billion) Clean Energy Initiative.</p>
<p>“Geothermal energy is important because it has the capacity to produce baseload power, diversify Australia’s energy supply and increase our energy security.</p>
<p>“The Australian Government has set a target for 20 per cent of Australia’s electricity generation to come from renewable sources by 2020; a policy which will likely require an additional 45,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity generation from renewable sources.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/100_2129.jpg" title="100_2129.jpg"></a>I was really disappointed in the Illinois State Fair this year. Last year there was so much <a href="/censys/?p=30">energy conservation </a>going on, both in the public and the <a href="/censys/?p=20">private sector</a>.  This year there was nothing but Conservation World. DO NOT get me wrong, as I said to the guy on the trolley as we drove by, &#8220;When I was young Conservation World was 2 guys under a tent. One guy from Ag. and one guy from DNR.&#8221; Now it takes up an entire corner of the Fair Grounds, has its own lake and the huge and energy efficient Department of Natural Resources building. It&#8217;s just that there wasn&#8217;t much going on around the rest of the fairgrounds. Yes, there were corn dogs and all the other exciting things that make the fair so cool, but I guess I got spoiled.</p>
<p>Anyway I go to the fair for the world famous Butter Cow. It starts out as this:</p>
<p><a href="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/cesblog1.jpg" title="cesblog1.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/cesblog1.jpg" alt="cesblog1.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/100_21291.jpg" title="100_21291.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Then they strip it down to this:</p>
<p> <a href="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/cesblog2.jpg" title="cesblog2.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/cesblog2.jpg" alt="cesblog2.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>That is a telephone by the way in its head. Then they build it back to this:</p>
<p><a href="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/cesblog3.jpg" title="cesblog3.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/cesblog3.jpg" alt="cesblog3.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The skunks are new!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jodie Foster, Pregnant Man, Iran, Prince Philip, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, American Idol, Obama, China, Beyonce, Rolling Stones. (sorry for the deception but please read below)</p>
<p>Normally I wouldn&#8217;t bother to cover this but since it&#8217;s on the list I felt I needed to &#8220;dis&#8221; it as much as I could. I even took the time to get Buzzes top searches for the week to punch it up a bit. I even checked every category Energy Tough Love has to publicize this human indignity. The list of &#8220;Religions&#8221; that I used to start this meditation on the relationship between Religion and the Environment placed Juche well down on the list but with 18 million adherents that still alot of folks. I had never heard of it before and I even asked a couple of people if they had heard of it. Imagine my suprise when I typed it into a search engine and up popped this Prick who claimed he was god:</p>
<p><font size="2" color="#008000"><a href="http://www.dictatorofthemonth.com/">www.dictatorofthemonth.com</a></font></p>
<p><a href="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/kim.jpg" title="kim.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/kim.jpg" alt="kim.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>During his lifetime he forced millions of people in North Korea to worship him. Can you imagine anything more degrading or disgusting then a man who points a loaded gun at your head and demands that you treat him like a god. You must pray to him. Oh most Divine Leader. Makes me want to puke. But then he is followed by this buffoon:</p>
<p><font size="2" color="#008000"><font size="2" color="#008000"><a href="http://www.beconfused.com/">www.beconfused.com</a></font></font></p>
<p><a href="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/jong.jpg" title="jong.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/jong.jpg" alt="jong.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Now they are &#8220;worshiping&#8221; something no better than a trained monkey. If they had an ENVIRONMENTAL group in North Korea, I wish them the best of luck but I ain&#8217;t gonna publish it. I ain&#8217;t even gona type it into a search engine. If anybody ever deserved to get a nuke shoved up his poop shoot. This would be it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know its totally weird that I spend so much time on the Illinois State Fair, but if I don&#8217;t get my corndog, my lemon shakeup, my french fries with the skins on doused in malt and our trip to the Chicken show at the Orr building, I can get cranky. Yes we tour the sheep barn too, but don&#8217;t expect any Weird Sheep Friday anytime soon.</p>
<p>Animal lovers and PETA people close your eyes because this is 2000-3000 Birds all in once place in &#8230;how can I say it&#8230;ah CAGES.</p>
<p>And yes John and Susan we go to the Chicken show every year&#8230;</p>
<p>First up the prize winning Turkey (no kidding)!</p>
<p> <a href="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/weirdbird-1.jpg" title="weirdbird-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/weirdbird-1.jpg" alt="weirdbird-1.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Then the prize winning Duck (quack quack) it really is a loud building to visit.</p>
<p> <a href="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/weirdbird21.jpg" title="weirdbird21.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/weirdbird21.jpg" alt="weirdbird21.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Showing some cute duck ass.</p>
<p>Mic Jagger the Chicken.</p>
<p> <a href="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/weirdbird31.jpg" title="weirdbird31.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/weirdbird31.jpg" alt="weirdbird31.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The dancing nearly naked chicken.</p>
<p><a href="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/weirdbird4.jpg" title="weirdbird4.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/weirdbird4.jpg" alt="weirdbird4.jpg" /></a></p>
<p> And This BAD BOY in all his glory.<a href="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/weirdbird5.jpg" title="weirdbird5.jpg"></a></p>
<p> <a href="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/weirdbird51.jpg" title="weirdbird51.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/weirdbird51.jpg" alt="weirdbird51.jpg" /></a><a href="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/weirdbird5.jpg" title="weirdbird5.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Those little things sticking out of the water bowel &#8211; yea they are chicken straws and who would break the last one?</p>
<p>Finally the big question -would you eat this angry bird? No probably not. Eggs &#8211; no way!</p>
<p><a href="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/weirdbird5.jpg" title="weirdbird5.jpg"></a><a href="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/weirdbird6.jpg" title="weirdbird6.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/censys/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/weirdbird6.jpg" alt="weirdbird6.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>To the seminal question &#8220;Do chickens have lips&#8221;? Oddly the technical answer is yes! Look very very closely.</p>
