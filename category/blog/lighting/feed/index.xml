										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I used to detest Streetlights. I know it is weird. I hate waste and after the all night lights at the Stratton Building in downtown Springfield, IL streetlights are the worst. They do not help people drive better and they do not deter most crime. Plus they are immense light polluters that prevent us from seeing the stars. But if they are emission controlled and solar powered, I guess I could at least get mellow on them.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Throughout 2018, efforts to protect habitats and conserve threatened species were driven by governments, scientists, NGOs and indigenous communities.</em></li>
<li><em>The world pledged more conservation funding to protect the oceans, while protections for coastal ecosystems were also boosted.</em></li>
<li><em>Conservation initiatives steered by indigenous communities continue to garner attention and praise, not least because they tend to be more sustainable and effective than top-down programs.</em></li>
<li><em>These were among the upbeat, happy environmental and conservation stories we reported on in 2018.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>“I like to envision the whole world as a jigsaw puzzle with all the pieces of puzzle scattered all over the place. If you look at the whole picture it is overwhelming and terrifying, but if you work on your little part of the jigsaw and know that people all over the world are working on their little bits of it, that’s what will give you hope,” Jane Goodall, the world-renowned primatologist and conservationist and Mongabay adviser, says in a <a href="https://web.facebook.com/janegoodall/posts/i-like-to-envision-the-whole-world-as-a-jigsaw-puzzle-with-all-the-pieces-of-the/10155236692247171/?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr" target="_blank" rel="external noopener" data-wpel-link="external">post on her Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>Hope for global conservation is what we wish to evoke in our readers with some of the more upbeat environmental stories from the past year that we have pieced together from around the world in this list. These include some of your favorite happy stories, from the expansion of protected areas for wildlife, cancelled reclamation projects that posed coastal ecosystem threats, to the impactful role of indigenous communities in conservation.</p>
<h3><strong>1. More protection for wildlife corridors</strong></h3>

<p>On a housekeeping note, websites contact me all the time to say, you cite this source: this one is better or more up-to-date or broken and here we fixed it. they want inserted in the actual Blog post that relates directly to their &#8220;improvement&#8221;. I AM ONE guy. I can neither verify what they say is true OR get in edit mode and go back in time for years. So, I am going to post them here as addenda. Click on them and see what surprise you get.</p>

<p>I saw you mentioned the Wikipedia guide to led lights on your page:</p>
<p><a href="/censys/date/2015/01">/censys/date/2015/01</a></p>
<p>That’s a great resource. In fact, it inspired me to create my own guide here:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I agreed to publish this here because it is such a different perspective then the one I have or CES has. We tend to blame builders for not just serving up top notch energy efficient residences. Then there is the issue of retrofitting. As always this is no endorsement of Ryan or his Real Estate firm. Believe me I have no intention of buying a home in Alaska.</p>

More buyers see the value of it, and more builders and sellers are starting to make changes in that direction. There is still a long way to go before energy efficiency and reducing waste becomes the standard for new homes and improved existing homes, but a larger pool of buyers demanding these features can help move the needle bit by bit.</div>

<div></div>
<div class="meta grey">By Ahmed Megahid, The Arab Weekly   |   May 15, 2017 at 10:33 AM</div>
<p><span class="story_dl">CAIRO, May 15 (UPI) &#8212;</span> The vista in the central province of Minya is as empty as far as the eye can see except for rows and rows of solar panels and the blue sky above.</p>
<p>The panels are helping Amr al-Saad&#8217;s 8-month-old power sta­tion address the worsening issue of brownouts and blackouts in the area.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few years ago, power supply was intermittent, which made the life of the residents of the province very tough,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is why I decided to establish my project where it is most needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>After generating electricity, Saad&#8217;s station feeds it into the na­tional grid where it is used to power houses, farms and workshops in Minya&#8217;s villages.</p>
<p>Saad&#8217;s project, which cost $100,000 and produces 650 kilo­watts of electricity each month, is part of a national drive to reduce Egypt&#8217;s dependence on fossil fuels by shifting to renewable energy. Egypt plans to produce 20 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2022 and 37 percent by 2035. It is an ambitious plan given that just 3 percent of electricity produced annually in Egypt today is from renewable sources.</p>

<div class="img-desc hidden-xs">
<p>Nate Adams says radical changes are needed in the home-performance business.</p>
<div class="meta"><span class="by-info">by Nate Adams<br />

</div>
<p>Utilities are now spending nearly <a href="http://sheltongrp.com/7-billion-later/">$7 billion a year</a> on energy-efficiency programs. It seems we have little to show for it aside from expensive consultants who will model any results you would like.</p>
<p>These programs tend to focus their marketing on the energy savings or money savings from the projects. Consumers don’t care. If they did, we would see geometric growth instead of a resounding &#8220;meh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others focus on better financing products, slicker sales pitches, faster energy audits, higher rebates or any of a myriad of other things.</p>
<p>In the residential sector, none of these are the problem. The lack of sales is the problem.</p>
<p>Projects are not being sold and implemented in substantial numbers. We need to slow it down, build relationships with consumers and educate them, learn and think systemically about the problems they have, and arrive at solutions that fit homeowner budgets.</p>

<h1>Discarded Laptop Batteries Keep the Lights On</h1>
<p class="intro">Millions of batteries discarded with computers have more than enough life to power home lighting for one year, researchers in India say.</p>
<ul class="byline">
<li>By <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/contributor/david-talbot/">David Talbot</a> on December 3, 2014</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the estimated 50 million lithium-ion laptop batteries discarded every year could provide electricity storage sufficient to light homes in poor countries, researchers at IBM say.</p>
<p>In work being aired this week at a <a href="http://acmdev.org/" target="0" rel="noopener">conference</a> in San Jose, researchers at IBM Research India in Bangalore found that at least 70 percent of all discarded batteries have enough life left to power an LED light at least four hours a day for a year.</p>
<p>While it’s possible to combine LED lights with solar panels and rechargeable batteries (see “<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/lists/innovators-under-35/2013/humanitarian/evans-wadongo/" target="0" rel="noopener">Innovators Under 35: Evans Wadongo</a>”), using discarded batteries could make the approach far cheaper.</p>
<p>“The most costly component in these systems is often the battery,” says Vikas Chandan, a research scientist at the lab’s Smarter Energy Group, who led the <a href="http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/%7Emjain/UrJar-DEV-2014.pdf" target="0" rel="noopener">project</a>. “In this case, the most expensive part of your storage solution is coming from trash.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I mean really if they are going to drop their insistence on solar panel installations as part of a retrofit then why keep the name? Are they now a software company or are they now a software and then install whatever company? Good questions with no answers. It would be like Tide if it were to stop making soap and started making dishwashers. Would they keep the name and why?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/a-peak-at-solarcitys-new-energy-efficiency-software?">http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/a-peak-at-solarcitys-new-energy-efficiency-software?</a></p>
<h1>Has SolarCity Created the Amazon 1-Click for Energy Efficiency?</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We believe SolarCity has the best database of residential energy use of anyone in the world.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Stephen Lacey: June 28, 2013</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After SolarCity shifted its energy efficiency strategy and pulled back from doing residential retrofits in-house, the solar services behemoth is moving straight into <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/intelligent-efficiency-innovations-reshaping-the-energy-efficiency-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intelligent efficiency</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GTM&#8217;s Eric Wesoff recently reported on SolarCity&#8217;s <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/SolarCity-Shifts-Its-Home-Efficiency-Strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolving</a> business plan and the <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Can-SolarCity-Scale-Energy-Efficiency-Services-Like-Solar-Roofs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resulting changes</a> that company executives say will scale residential efficiency in the same way solar services have <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/us-residential-solar-financing-to-reach-5.7-billion-by-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scaled residential solar</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But solar is very different from efficiency. For the most part, solar is very standardized and installations are uniform from home to home. Efficiency retrofits encompass an extraordinarily broad category of activities and skills. Incentives are also quite different for efficiency, making it more complicated from a financial perspective. That&#8217;s why <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/are-solar-companies-equipped-to-get-into-energy-efficiency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only a handful</a> of U.S. solar contractors have offered efficiency as an in-house service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SolarCity decided that doing the retrofit work itself was not the best way to scale. Instead, it has turned from manpower to the power of big data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The secret sauce is a &#8220;simulation engine&#8221; that shows homeowners exactly how much they&#8217;re spending on energy everywhere in their house. The initial database was created using information from 16,000 home energy audits performed over the last five years. It relies on an algorithm developed at the Department of Energy that crunches 100 million calculations per home for each individual energy efficiency audit (which is still performed by SolarCity when installing solar).</p>

<p>&#8220;The simulation software looks at every component in a home in relation to one another,&#8221; said SolarCity COO Peter Rive. &#8220;Every ten minutes, it thinks about what one thing is doing and about its effect on the rest of the systems within the home.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Other things have not changed. I mean we are still burning coal to fuel electric generators, 30 years after we should have stopped. We still flirt with the idea of Nuclear Powered power plants. But here is part of the Georgia Code, a State not known for anything progressive.</p>

<p><a name="22"></a>22.    What is the difference between a mass wall and a basement wall, and what are the insulation requirements for both?</p>
<p>A mass wall is a heavy wall that is more than half above grade wall and is constructed of a fairly massive material (e.g., concrete, block, insulated concrete forms, masonry cavity, non-veneered brick , adobe, compressed block, rammed earth, and solid logs). A basement wall is a wall that is more than half below grade and encloses conditioned space. Insulation requirements for basement walls and mass walls depend on the location of the insulation and the type of insulation (whether it is continuous or insulation installed in a cavity). Requirements also vary by climate zone. Below is a table detailing the insulation requirements in the energy code.</p>
<table width="548" border="0">

<h1>Small Ozarks Farm Provides Innovative Example For Sustainable Living</h1>
<div> Article | <time datetime="2012-12-05" content="2012-12-05T17:14:31-06:00">December 5, 2012 &#8211; 5:14pm</time> | By <a href="http://ksmu.org/author/shane-franklin" rel="foaf:publications">Shane Franklin</a></div>
<p>One farm in the Ozarks is the location of a series of unique experiments in sustainable living.  If these experiments prove successful, it would greatly affect the future of sustainable technologies and how people think about building their homes. KSMU’s Shane Franklin had the opportunity to tour the farm, and has this story.</p>
<p>Rockspan Farm, the home of Dan and Margy Chiles, is unique in so many ways. They wanted to build a farm that could be an example to others, and a test lab for experimental technologies they’ve been personally developing over the years.</p>
<p>“We are trying a number of new technologies here to make houses more efficient and to make a livable space without having to burn a lot of coal.</p>

<p>RockSpan is the name for our 12 acre farm and house in western Greene County, Missouri.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project is the West end of Division street, 11 miles from Springfield, Missouri.   The colorful plan below shows the family farm: approximately 227 acres outlined in red with a possible land use plan.  Our 12 acres are inside the larger farm.</p>
