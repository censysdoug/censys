										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was going to write about Germany making 85 percent of its power with renewables on a particular day. As fun as that is this is better. Egypt is going to invest billions of dollars in solar (and wind?). That is so exciting. I hope the rest of the countries of the Middle East follow suit.</p>

<h1 class="st_headline title">Egypt looks to the future with renewable energy plan</h1>
<div></div>
<div class="meta grey">By Ahmed Megahid, The Arab Weekly   |   May 15, 2017 at 10:33 AM</div>
<p><span class="story_dl">CAIRO, May 15 (UPI) &#8212;</span> The vista in the central province of Minya is as empty as far as the eye can see except for rows and rows of solar panels and the blue sky above.</p>
<p>The panels are helping Amr al-Saad&#8217;s 8-month-old power sta­tion address the worsening issue of brownouts and blackouts in the area.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few years ago, power supply was intermittent, which made the life of the residents of the province very tough,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is why I decided to establish my project where it is most needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>After generating electricity, Saad&#8217;s station feeds it into the na­tional grid where it is used to power houses, farms and workshops in Minya&#8217;s villages.</p>
<p>Saad&#8217;s project, which cost $100,000 and produces 650 kilo­watts of electricity each month, is part of a national drive to reduce Egypt&#8217;s dependence on fossil fuels by shifting to renewable energy. Egypt plans to produce 20 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2022 and 37 percent by 2035. It is an ambitious plan given that just 3 percent of electricity produced annually in Egypt today is from renewable sources.</p>

<h2 class="entry-title fusion-post-title" data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">Installation of New England’s Largest Battery Energy Storage System is Underway</h2>
<div class="post-content">
<p>NEC Energy Solutions has begun the installation and commissioning of a 2 MW, 3.9MWh GSS® grid energy storage solution for the Sterling Municipal Light Department (SMLD) in Sterling, Massachusetts. Once complete in December 2016, it will be the largest system of its kind installed in New England and the first utility scale project in the State. In the event of an extended grid outage due to a natural disaster, this utility scale Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) can be used to power local emergency response facilities using power generated from two nearby solar plants. The system will also provide enhanced clean energy usage and cost savings to the town of Sterling.</p>
<p>Sandia provided SMLD with analysis to identify the optimal deployment site, amount, and installation type of energy storage within budgetary limits. Sandia also assisted with crafting a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the BESS system, vetting bids, and installing and dispatching the system. “Sandia was instrumental in helping us pull that together. We had developed a minor RFP and they brought in the technical support that we needed to get this done right. Working with Dan Borneo and Ray Byrne on this project has been very valuable to us,” said Sean Hamilton, General Manager of SMLD.</p>
<p>Going forward, Sandia will help SMLD oversee the operation of the BESS to optimally maximize economic returns while safeguarding SMLD’s ability to provide resilient power; monitor BESS operations; and collect operational data for one-year post-commissioning. The data will be used to further the U.S. Department of Energy’s/Sandia’s understanding of the benefits and applications of battery storage in the utility context and provide a number of important battery use cases in resiliency, cost savings, and revenues that can be adopted by numerous municipal utilities and vertically integrated utilities.</p>

<p>here is a sense of excitement in the wake of a momentous <a href="http://globalwarmingisreal.com/2015/12/16/26754/">Paris Climate Agreement</a> and adoption of the <a href="http://globalwarmingisreal.com/2015/09/28/amina-j-mohammed-sustainable-development-goals/">Sustainable Development Goals</a> last year. The “<a href="http://globalwarmingisreal.com/2015/11/12/we-are-in-the-midst-of-an-energy-revolution/">energy revolution</a>” is already underway, the consequences of which are far-reaching, transforming the way we do business, build our homes and live our lives.</p>
<p>But there’s an even more immediate solution available to all of us, and it will not only reduce our carbon footprint, but save money as well. It’s the low-hanging fruit of <a href="http://globalwarmingisreal.com/2015/11/24/26628/">energy efficiency</a>. From the largest business to the <a href="http://hippiemagazine.com/2016/01/03/green-home-remodeling-making-home-sustainable/" target="_blank">smallest household</a>, energy efficiency is the first step in building a sustainable future.</p>
<p>As individuals and businesses go, so goes an entire nation. Courtesy of the home improvement experts at <a href="http://www.halfprice.com.au/" target="_blank">HalfPrice.com.au</a>, the infographic below illustrates the most energy efficient countries in the world, based on information from the <a href="http://aceee.org/" target="_blank">American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy</a> (ACEEE). As this infographic demonstrates, one important aspect of promoting energy efficiency is government policy and incentives:</p>

<p id="story-continues-1" class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="341" data-total-count="341">VATICAN CITY — <a class="meta-per" title="More articles about Pope Francis." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/f/francis_i/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Pope Francis</a> on Thursday called for a radical transformation of politics, economics and individual lifestyles to confront environmental degradation and <a class="meta-classifier" title="Recent and archival news about global warming." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">climate change</a>, as his much-awaited papal encyclical blended a biting critique of consumerism and irresponsible development with a plea for swift and unified global action.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="409" data-total-count="750">The vision that Francis outlined in the 184-page encyclical is sweeping in ambition and scope: He described a relentless exploitation and destruction of the environment, for which he blamed apathy, the reckless pursuit of profits, excessive faith in technology and political shortsightedness. The most vulnerable victims are the world’s poorest people, he declared, who are being dislocated and disregarded.</p>
<p>The first pope from the developing world, Francis, an Argentine, used the encyclical — titled “Laudato Si’,” or “Praise Be to You” — to highlight the crisis posed by climate change. He placed most of the blame on fossil fuels and human activity while warning of an “unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequence for all of us” if swift action is not taken. Developed, industrialized countries were mostly responsible, he said, and were obligated to help poorer nations confront the crisis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So after the Election we took three days off and went to Giant City State Park and drove over to see the Garden of the Gods. Giant City was disappointing:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=garden+of+the+gods&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a"> https://www.google.com/search?q=garden+of+the+gods&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a</a></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">With its breathtaking natural beauty and unlimited opportunities for outdoor recreation, a trip to Giant City State Park near Carbondale is sure to delight visitors of all ages. From camping and horseback riding to fishing and rappelling, it’s an outdoor lover’s paradise. Visitors will marvel at the many wilderness trails. Especially popular is a hike on Giant City Nature Trail, home of the “Giant City Streets” huge bluffs of sandstone formed 12,000 years ago .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Nestled in the Shawnee National Forest, just minutes south of Carbondale, the Union / Jackson county park was named for the unique impressions made by its massive sandstone structures. Eons of geological faulting and folding have molded a landscape like none other, which is now clothed in lush garments of fern, moss, large flowering mints, hundreds of species of wild flowers and 75-plus varieties of towering trees. The natural splendor of Giant City has made it a renowned retreat that attracts more than 1.2 million visitors annually.</span></p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>But Garden of the Gods was amazing:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.shawneeforest.com/Hiking/GardenoftheGods.aspx">http://www.shawneeforest.com/Hiking/GardenoftheGods.aspx</a></p>
<p>More than 320 million years ago, the wind and rain patiently started to chisel away at large deposits of sedimentary rock located in what is now, Shawnee National Forest . Over the years, the elements have sculpted some of the most stunning and extraordinary rock formations known to man. This garden of sandstone sculptures and vast untouched wilderness was fittingly named Garden of the Gods.</p>
<p>The park contains a variety of plant and animal life, adding to the scenic beauty of the Shawnee Forest. Garden of the Gods covers more than 3,300 acres of forest throughout the Southeastern Illinois counties of Saline, Pope and Hardin. There are also plenty of trails for backpacking and horseback riding, allowing nature lovers a welcome tour of what the lively environment has to offer.</p>

<p>Go there and be envious. More on Tuesday.</p>

<p><em><strong> </strong><strong> Ere many generations pass, our  machinery will<br />
be driven             by power obtainable at any point  in the<br />
universe. It is a mere question of time when men<br />
will succeed in attaching their machinery to the<br />
very wheelwork of nature.</strong></em></p>
<p>&#8212;Nikola Tesla<br />
<strong>The World We Envision</strong><strong><br />
</strong><strong>Clean, safe, abundant, inexpensive energy for  all… stabilized climate… clean and healthy water, food, and air for all…  beautiful blue skies over our cities… low-impact, sustainable forestry  and agriculture… beautiful landscapes unspoiled by wires and  smokestacks… recycling of virtually all wastes… rivers running<br />
free and natural… thriving sustainable local economies…  living standards and education rates increasing… birth rates declining…<br />
a global culture of sharing… unleashed human creativity…<br />
a new and lasting era of world peace…</strong><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p>With a revolution in energy as the foundation of renewed and  loving stewardship of our planet, we can transform our world into a  beautiful and healthy home full of promise, opportunity, abundance, and  peace for all of humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Our Mission</strong><strong><br />
</strong>The New Energy Movement acts to promote the rapid  widespread deployment of advanced, clean, and sustainable energy sources  across our imperiled planet. This transformation in the way our  civilization generates and uses energy provides the best physical means  to protect the biosphere, remediate ecological damage, and enhance the  health and well-being of the global human family.</p>
<p>The New Energy Movement&#8217;s major priority is to educate  the public, policymakers, and investors about the need to support  research, development, and use of zero-point energy, magnetic  generators, advanced hydrogen processes, and other little-known powerful  energy technologies now emerging from inventors and scientists all over  the world&#8230;</p>
<p><strong> The Challenges</strong><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Critical and unprecedented challenges now face our  civilization, inflicting a terrible toll on our people, our companion  species, and the planet itself. If not reversed soon, they threaten to  end human life on Earth.</p>
<p>Without a revolution in energy, we will not be able to act  with the speed and scope demanded by the climate change emergency we  face. With this revolution we will be able to create sustainable and  just economic development required for world peace.</p>
<p>______________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>Our survival will require<br />
a vast and dramatic shift<br />
in how human civilization<br />
generates and uses energy.</strong></p>

<h1>Cash for Caulkers – The Definitive Guide To The  Home Star Energy Retrofit Act of 2010</h1>
<div>Posted on June 11, 2010 at 11:41 am</div>
<p>“Cash for Caulkers” is nearly here. Last month the House of  Representatives passed H.R. 5019 – also known as the Home Star Energy  Retrofit Act of 2010 or “Cash for Caulkers” – to kick-start  construction, create jobs and cut back carbon emissions. While the bill  still needs to clear the Senate, supporters predict it will pass this  summer.</p>
<p>This is great news for homeowners and contractors alike. The bill  provisions $6 billion for energy-efficient or “green” retrofits. It is  expected to fund renovations for 3 million families, create 168,000 new  jobs and save consumers $9.2 billion on energy bills over the next 10  years.</p>
<p>But in order to cash in on upcoming rebates, homeowners and  contractors will need to do their homework. There are 13 types of  retrofits eligible for funding. Each retrofit has unique eligibility  requirements and set rebate amounts. You can read the full text <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h5019eh.txt.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>We made it really easy to wade through the legalese. Below is a table  that breaks down the 13 retrofits of the bill, along with the  requirements and rebate amount for each. In addition to the requirements  we listed, each retrofit must comply with Building Performance  Institute (BPI) standards or other procedures to be approved by the  Secretary of Energy.</p>

<p>We also decided to combine these retrofits into three packages that  will help homeowners get the best bang for their buck. But first, let’s  review the program details.</p>
<p><strong>Who is Eligible and How to Qualify?</strong><br />
The Home Star bill offers two rebate programs, the “Silver Star” program  and “Gold Star” program. Here are details for each:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Silver Star</strong> – Unless another amount is specified in  the “Rebate Amount” column above, homeowners will receive a $1,000  rebate for each retrofit listed in our table. The maximum amount of  rebates paid out will be $3,000 or 50% of the total cost, whichever is  lower. For example, if a homeowner spends a total of $4,000 on eligible  retrofits, they will get $2,000 or 50% back as a rebate. If they spend  $8,000 on eligible retrofits, they would only receive $3,000 in rebates  instead of $4,000 (which would be 50% of the cost).</li>
<li><strong>Gold Star</strong> – To qualify for the Gold Star program,  homeowners must reduce their total home energy consumption by 20%. A  $3,000 rebate will be rewarded for this reduction. Homeowners can  receive an additional $1,000 for each additional 5% reduction, up to a  total rebate of $8,000 or 50% of the total retrofit cost. Rebates may be  provided for any of the retrofits listed under the Silver Star program,  or for any other energy-saving measure, including: home energy  management systems, high-efficiency appliances, highly reflective  roofing, awnings, canopies, and similar external fenestration (window)  attachments, automatic boiler water temperature controllers,  energy-efficient wood products, insulated vinyl siding, and mechanical  air circulation and heat exchangers in a passiv</li>

<p>We  have had numerous fisherman, that have been hired through BP&#8217;s Master  Vessel Charter  Agreement to work on the oil spill response, tell us that their BP  &#8220;bosses&#8221; have told them that if they use a respirator or any safety  equipment not provided by BP that they would be fired.</p>

<h1>Efforts to End Oil Flow From BP Well Over Until Relief Wells Are  Finished</h1>
<p><cite> By Jim Polson &#8211;                  Jun 1, 2010 </cite></p>
<p>BP Plc has decided not to attach a second blowout preventer on its leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico and efforts to end the flow are over until the relief wells are finished, according to the U.S. Coast Guard’s Thad Allen, who spoke at a press conference today.</p>

<h2>[<a title="Edit section: Usage" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Greenwash&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1">edit</a>] Usage</h2>
<p>Greenwashing was coined by New York environmentalist Jay Westerveld<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwash#cite_note-2">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwash#cite_note-3">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwash#cite_note-4">[5]</a></sup> in a 1986 essay regarding the hotel industry&#8217;s practice of placing  green placards in each room, promoting reuse of guest-towels, ostensibly  to &#8220;save the environment&#8221;. Westerveld noted that, in most cases, little  or no effort toward waste recycling was being implemented by these  institutions, due in part to the lack of cost-cutting affected by such  practice. Westerveld opined that the actual objective of this &#8220;green  campaign&#8221; on the part of many hoteliers was, in fact, increased profit.  Westerveld hence monitored this and other outwardly environmentally  conscientious acts with a greater, underlying purpose of profit increase  as <em>greenwashing</em>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_rec.php?id=1438" target="_blank" rel="noopener">night  view of the earth</a> has become a very popular depiction of this  planet. Although the NASA itself says that “The brightest areas of the  Earth are the most urbanized, but not necessarily the most populated”  many people mistake this view as a representation of the inhabited  places on the globe. Our <a href="http://benhennig.postgrad.shef.ac.uk/?p=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gridded  population cartogram</a> can help to get a better understanding of the  relation of people and light. The following map is a reprojection of the  earth at night that shows the nightview in relation to the population  distribution. The gridlines are kept in a light colour and thus allow to  identify those areas where the lines converge (representing the  unpopulated regions). In contrast, the populated areas are given the  most space, so that one can easily see which populated areas are  literally illuminated at night – and where there are people living in  darkness. The resulting map is an impressive picture of an unequal  world, with large parts of Africa living in darkness, and the affluent  countries in Europe and North America glowing in the dark:<a href="http://benhennig.postgrad.shef.ac.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/EarthatNight.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img decoding="async" title="The Earth at Night (projected on a population cartogram)" src="http://benhennig.postgrad.shef.ac.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/EarthatNight.jpg" alt="The Earth at Night projected on a gridded population cartogram" width="620" /></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes I know I am a google whore. It&#8217;s been said before. Here is the deal however. If the Healthcare Industry&#8230;and that is what it is, an Industry, cut their energy cost tomorrow, they could pass that savings on to you and &#8220;bend the healthcare curve down&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/consumptionbriefs/cbecs/pbawebsite/health/health_howuseenergy.htm" target="_self" rel="noopener">http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/consumptionbriefs/cbecs/pbawebsite/health/health_howuseenergy.htm</a></p>

<hr />
<p></span></em><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">How do they use energy  and how much does it cost?</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/consumptionbriefs/cbecs/pbawebsite/health/health_btubyfuel.gif" border="1" alt="Total Energy Use by Fuel Type" width="481" height="440" /></p>
<p><a name="Ref 1"></a><strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica;"><span><a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/consumptionbriefs/cbecs/pbawebsite/health/health_refbtu.htm">Reference 1:   What is a Btu?</a></span></span></em></strong></p>
<p>Health care buildings account for 11 percent of all commercial  energy consumption, using a total of 561 trillion Btu of combined site  electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, and district steam or hot water.  They are the fourth highest consumer of total energy of all the building types (<a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/consumptionbriefs/cbecs/pbawebsite/contents.htm#TotalEnergyFigure">see total  energy figure on home page</a>).</p>
<p>Natural gas and electricity are the predominant fuels used in  health care buildings, with natural gas used a bit more than electricity.  Health care buildings are more likely to use district heat than most  building types.</p>
<p>Site electricity is the amount of electricity consumed within the  building; electricity use can also be expressed as primary electricity, which  includes the energy consumed in generating and transmitting electricity.  Health care buildings used 637 trillion Btu of primary electricity, which  brings the total energy consumption for health care buildings up to 987  trillion Btu, or 9 percent of total primary consumption for all commercial  buildings.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Some estimates put it as low as 9%, but that would be real savings.</p>
<p><a href="http://managedhealthcareexecutive.modernmedicine.com/mhe/Exclusives/Healthcare-facilities-account-for-9-of-energy-cons/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/569619" target="_self" rel="noopener">http://managedhealthcareexecutive.modernmedicine.com/mhe/Exclusives/Healthcare-facilities-account-for-9-of-energy-cons/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/569619</a></p>
<p>Employees  and executives are being called upon to assist as organizations  implement &#8220;green&#8221; systems within healthcare facilities.  The term &#8220;green building&#8221; or &#8220;sustainability&#8221; can mean a variety of  things. Commonly, however, &#8220;green&#8221; design and construction  includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>promoting a healthier, more productive build environment;</li>
<li>increasing  energy efficiency;</li>
<li>increasing efficiency in the use of water  and other scarce resources;</li>
<li>reducing the project&#8217;s impact on the  surrounding environment; and</li>
<li>decreasing liquid and solid  wastes, building emissions, and other adverse impacts of the building&#8217;s  operation on the broader  environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sustainability  has particular resonance for healthcare facilities because improved  indoor environmental quality demonstrably  improves the health of patients, professionals, staff and visitors.  Further, healthcare facilities are major generators of  waste and are substantial consumers of increasingly energy and water.</p>
<p>Healthcare facilities generate more than 2  million tons of solid waste annually, which accounts for the majority of  hospital  waste disposal cost. Given a likely increase in waste disposal costs,  designing or renovating a facility to more efficiently  handle waste is an economic necessity.</p>
<p>Additionally, equipment-intensive facilities  use several times more energy than office buildings, while hospitals  typically  use 90 to150 gallons of water per bed per day. In fact, healthcare  facilities account for 9% of all commercial energy consumption  in America, according to the Department of Energy&#8217;s Energy Information  Administration.</p>
