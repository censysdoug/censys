										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes I am a Headline Whore. But this is a very real nitty gritty get your hands dirty post. Most of the posts here are about environmental theories, or solar power writ large. But many environmental issues involve a compost pile and turning them, or washing off crud from recyclables. In this case if you have grass, and live in town you have to cut it. That means you have maintenance things to attend to. So here they are.</p>

</section>
<p>Following the <strong>lawn tractor maintenance</strong> advice in your tractor’s manual is the best way to keep it humming along smoothly. But owner’s manuals usually only tell you basically what to do and when to do it—they seldom include the tips and real-world wisdom gained through experience. So we asked veteran mechanics which steps are the most important and how to make <strong>lawn tractor maintenance and tubeless tire repair</strong> faster and easier.</p>
<p>You’ll save too. Dealers typically charge more than $200 for routine maintenance that includes an oil change and new spark plugs and filters. But you can do all these things—and more—in just a few hours. A <strong>lawn tractor maintenance</strong> kit from your dealer (less than $75) might cost a few bucks more than buying parts separately but ensures that you get all the right stuff. And new tubes for a <strong>tubeless tire</strong> repair cost from $5 &#8211; $15.</p>

<p>In 2013, a project called My Micro NY won a design competition for the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-smallest-apartments-yet-are-being-built-in-new-york-city-and-its-just-300-square-feet-2012-7">New York&#8217;s first &#8220;micro apartments&#8221;</a> sponsored by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.</p>
<p>Intended to create affordable housing for singles in New York City, those promised prefabricated affordable units are finally being assembled in the Brooklyn Navy Yard and will be unveiled this spring in Manhattan&#8217;s Kips Bay, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/realestate/micro-apartments-tiny-homes-prefabricated-in-brooklyn.html?_r=1#">according to The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>The city&#8217;s first &#8220;micro&#8221; building will have 55 rental apartments, all ranging from 260- to 360-square-feet with big windows, ample storage space, and Juliet balconies.</p>
<p>Because the architects believed amenities are important to micro-unit dwellers, the building will also have a public meeting space, café, and common rooftop garden for residents, as well as a laundry room, residential storage space, a bike room, and fitness space.</p>

<h3 id="content_title">A Super Solar Flare</h3>
<p><strong>May                      6, 2008:</strong> At 11:18 AM on the cloudless  morning of                      Thursday, September 1, 1859, 33-year-old Richard  Carrington—widely                      acknowledged to be one of England&#8217;s foremost solar  astronomers—was                      in his well-appointed private observatory. Just as  usual on                      every sunny day, his telescope was projecting an  11-inch-wide                      image of the sun on a screen, and Carrington  skillfully drew                      the sunspots he saw.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1859MNRAS..20...13C"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2008/05/06/06may_carringtonflare_resources/sunspot_med.gif" border="0" alt="" hspace="10" width="254" height="209" align="right" /></a>Right:</strong> Sunspots sketched by Richard Carrington on Sept. 1,  1859.                      Copyright: Royal Astronomical Society: <a href="http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1859MNRAS..20...13C">more</a>.</p>
<p>On                       that morning, he was capturing the likeness of an  enormous                      group of sunspots. Suddenly, before his eyes, two  brilliant                      beads of blinding white light appeared over the  sunspots,                      intensified rapidly, and became kidney-shaped.  Realizing that                      he was witnessing something unprecedented and &#8220;being                       somewhat flurried by the surprise,&#8221; Carrington later                       wrote, &#8220;I hastily ran to call someone to witness the                       exhibition with me. On returning within 60 seconds, I  was                      mortified to find that it was already much changed  and enfeebled.&#8221;                      He and his witness watched the white spots contract  to mere                      pinpoints and disappear.</p>
<p>It                      was 11:23 AM. Only five minutes had passed.</p>
<p>Just                       before dawn the next day, skies all over planet  Earth erupted                      in red, green, and purple auroras so brilliant that  newspapers                      could be read as easily as in daylight. Indeed,  stunning auroras                      pulsated even at near tropical latitudes over Cuba,  the Bahamas,                      Jamaica, El Salvador, and Hawaii.</p>

<p>Even                       more disconcerting, telegraph systems worldwide went  haywire.                      Spark discharges shocked telegraph operators and set  the telegraph                      paper on fire. Even when telegraphers disconnected  the batteries                      powering the lines, aurora-induced electric currents  in the                      wires still allowed messages to be transmitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;What                      Carrington saw was a white-light solar flare—a  magnetic explosion                      on the sun,&#8221; explains David Hathaway, solar physics  team                      lead at NASA&#8217;s Marshall Space Flight Center in  Huntsville,                      Alabama.</p>
<p>Now                      we know that solar flares happen frequently,  especially during                      solar sunspot maximum. Most betray their existence  by releasing                      X-rays (recorded by X-ray telescopes in space) and  radio noise                      (recorded by radio telescopes in space and on  Earth). In Carrington&#8217;s                      day, however, there were no X-ray satellites or  radio telescopes.                      No one knew flares existed until that September  morning when                      one super-flare produced enough light to rival the  brightness                      of the sun itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s                      rare that one can actually see the brightening of  the solar                      surface,&#8221; says Hathaway. &#8220;It takes a lot of energy                      to heat up the surface of the sun!&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://sxi.ngdc.noaa.gov/sxi_greatest.html"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2008/05/06/06may_carringtonflare_resources/flare_sxi_strip.gif" border="1" alt="" width="512" height="308" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Above:</strong> A modern solar flare recorded Dec. 5, 2006, by the  X-ray Imager                      onboard NOAA&#8217;s GOES-13 satellite. The flare was so  intense,                      it actually <a href="http://sxi.ngdc.noaa.gov/sxi_greatest.html">damaged</a> the instrument that took the picture. Researchers  believe                      Carrington&#8217;s flare was much more energetic than this  one.</p>
<p>The                      explosion produced not only a surge of visible light  but also                      a mammoth cloud of charged particles and detached  magnetic                      loops—a &#8220;CME&#8221;—and hurled that cloud directly toward                      Earth. The next morning when the CME arrived, it  crashed into                      Earth&#8217;s magnetic field, causing the global bubble of  magnetism                      that surrounds our planet to shake and quiver.  Researchers                      call this a &#8220;geomagnetic storm.&#8221; Rapidly moving                      fields induced enormous electric currents that  surged through                      telegraph lines and disrupted communications.</p>

<p>As it happened, a second member of the Royal Astronomical society  (another Richard, this one the otherwise-obscure Richard Hodgson in  London), also saw the flare and so proved conclusively that there was  nothing wrong with Carrington’s equipment. By the time this was  realized, though, it was already pretty clear that something truly odd  had happened—<em>something</em> rattled the Earth’s atmosphere the next  day, as described above.</p>
<p>The connections between light, magnetism, and electricity were still  incompletely understood in 1859 (<a href="http://www.clerkmaxwellfoundation.org/">James Clerk Maxwell</a> would not entirely coincidentally publish his <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/Projects/Johnson/Diagrams/Ch4_4-3.gif"><em>tour  de force</em></a> on the subject over the next few years), but Michael  Faraday had already discovered the <a href="http://www.engineering.com/Library/ArticlesPage/tabid/85/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/207/Faradays-Law-of-Induction.aspx">Law  of Induction</a>. Shorn of mathematics, it provided for the creation of  electricity if a piece of metal cuts across a magnetic field or the  field instead cuts over the metal. That was the connection between the  strange readings at Kew and the telegraphic events around the world. The  enormous auroras were symptomatic of huge fluctuations in the Earth’s  magnetic field, and those fluctuations were playing across the world’s  200,000 kilometers of telegraph wire. By analyzing the directions  followed by wires and comparing them to the effects that occurred at  their stations, it was even possible to develop a rough idea of how the  fluctuations had flowed around the planet.</p>
<p>Though the correlation between sunspots and the fluctuations of  Earth’s magnetic field had already been discovered by <a href="http://www.todayinsci.com/S/Sabine_Edward/Sabine_Edward.htm">Edward  Sabine</a>, this was the first really solid evidence that the Sun could  reach out to the Earth with something other than light or gravity.  Conservative by nature, Carrington himself didn’t commit to a connection  between his flare and the electromagnetic storm, but now we know that  the Sun throws off <a href="http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/CMEs.shtml">coronal mass  ejections</a> consisting of protons and electrons (the first having been  observed in 1971). We even know for sure that the 1859 event was caused  by one, despite the more than a century since it occurred; protons and  electrons expelled by the Sun move quickly, but not anything like the  speed of light, so that accounts for the delay between Carrington seeing  his flare and the beginning of the auroras.</p>
<p>The clincher can be found on <a href="http://www.geomag.bgs.ac.uk/images/carrington_images/hex570.jpg">one  of the charts linked to previously</a>. There’s a “fishhook” shape  (marked with an arrow labeled “D: Solar Flare Effect”) in the bottom  trace. That’s called a <a href="http://www.ips.gov.au/Educational/3/1/1">magnetic  crochet</a>, and it’s the characteristic bump in the Earth’s magnetic  field caused by X-rays from the coronal mass ejection ionizing part of  our atmosphere. X-rays move at the speed of light, outpacing the charged  particles following them—and it takes eight minutes to get from the Sun  to the Earth at that speed. As closely as can be told from the  relatively crude instrumentation that drew the track (hours are listed  at the top of the same chart), the crochet occurred within the same time  frame as Carrington’s closely timed 11:18 observation of the flare. So  we have both a delayed effect from the slow stream of charged particles  and a high-speed effect moving at light speed; a coronal mass ejection  fits the bill exactly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have spent the last 30 or 40 days since we got back from California going on about dire things happening with the planet, ways to save energy in your house, and the crazy commodity prices that I sometimes forget that you have to laugh. Why be on the planet if you don&#8217;t. This was brought home to me by a blog that Dan Piraro just posted.</p>
<p><a href="http://bizarrocomic.blogspot.com/">http://bizarrocomic.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>In that Post he talks about going to a school in Indianapolis and talking to some kids. He made a joke which I thought was pretty funny about being loaded when he was there. First he got hopped by locals who thought putting the kids picture on his blog would endanger them somehow. Then they hopped him for saying he was loaded&#8230;.That really got to me. Part of it was that I had planned to go see him there and had to cancel for a very important event, my inlaws 60th Wedding Anniversery. Such things are irreplaceable and though many plans for the trip had been made&#8230;still your 60th Wedding Anniversery is huge. l I felt bad because here Dan had gone and done a nice thing and probably turned on (every pun intended) some youngsters to Art while volunteering his time. But also Dan will probably not come back to Indianapolis again because of his treatment and that is as close as he usually gets to Springfiel, IL.</p>
<p>It might be because another of my favorite funny guys the Sports Writer Mike Nadel got fired by the GateHouse people to save money. I mean GateHouse is like the Tribune, they are what&#8217;s wrong with this country. They took on trillions of $$$s in debt to produce an inferior product. He is still being funny here:</p>
<p><a href="http://thebaldesttruth.blogspot.com/">http://thebaldesttruth.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>So please give him a read and if he ever produces anything accidentally about the environment I might post it here. Then I started thinking about all the funny guys I have been missing,</p>
<p>Lewis Grizzard</p>

<p>Who must be laughing in heaven because his last book came out two years after he died.</p>
<p>Dave Berry (pulizer prize winning Dave Berry I might add)</p>

<p>The point being that this cartoon has languished in a pile oh stuff for ever, because more serious things had to be posted. As penance I put it up on Sunday (when I normally don&#8217;t post) this Dan Piraro gem from early December:</p>

<h1>Honor Martin Luther King</h1>
<p>by Fighting Environmental Racism, Promoting Environmental Justice</p>
<p class="date">Monday January 21, 2008</p>
<p>On Martin Luther King Day, Americans celebrate the life and vision of the late civil rights leader who has inspired generations of people to work toward a society characterized by equal opportunity and free of racial discrimination.</p>
<p>In 1968, Dr. King’s life was cut short by an assassin’s bullet, a violent act of racism that stunned and saddened people worldwide. Today, racism still threatens the lives of millions of African-Americans and other people of color.</p>
<p>That threat includes environmental racism, in which the residents of poor minority communities are subject to much higher health and safety risks than people in more affluent communities because of the proximity of their homes and schools to landfills, hazardous waste sites and factories that pollute the air and water.</p>
<p>Environmental racism was first documented nearly 30 years ago by Dr. Robert Bullard&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That&#8217;s right for you rap fans Hump up to the Heat Pump, Jump up to my Heat Pump it&#8217;ll burn you baby!&#8230;Well maybe not. The idea behind a heat pump is temperature differential. When its cold outside you throw heat inside because the fluid is colder than the cold and when its hot outside you throw heat out side because the heat is hotter then the hot. Well let&#8217;s let the experts explain&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump</a></p>
<p>According to the second law of thermodynamics heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder location to a hotter area; work is required to achieve this. Heat pumps differ in how they apply this work to move heat, but they can essentially be thought of as heat engines operating in reverse. A heat engine allows energy to flow from a hot &#8216;source&#8217; to a cold heat &#8216;sink&#8217;, extracting a fraction of it as work in the process. Conversely, a heat pump requires work to move thermal energy from a cold source to a warmer heat sink.</p>
<p>Since the heat pump uses a certain amount of work to move the heat, the amount of energy deposited at the hot side is greater than the energy taken from the cold side by an amount equal to the work required. Conversely, for a heat engine, the amount of energy taken from the hot side is greater than the amount of energy deposited in the cold heat sink since some of the heat has been converted to work.</p>
<p>One common type of heat pump works by exploiting the physical properties of an evaporating and condensing fluid known as a refrigerant.</p>
<p style="width: 302px" class="thumbinner"><a href="/censys/wiki/Image:Heatpump.svg" title="A simple stylized diagram of a heat pump's vapor-compression refrigeration cycle: 1) condenser, 2) expansion valve, 3) evaporator, 4) compressor." class="image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" border="0" width="300" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Heatpump.svg/300px-Heatpump.svg.png" alt="A simple stylized diagram of a heat pump's vapor-compression refrigeration cycle: 1) condenser, 2) expansion valve, 3) evaporator, 4) compressor." height="175" class="thumbimage" /></a></p>

<p>A simple stylized diagram of a heat pump&#8217;s vapor-compression refrigeration cycle: 1) condenser, 2) expansion valve, 3) evaporator, 4) compressor.</p>
<p>The working fluid, in its gaseous state, is pressurized and circulated through the system by a compressor. On the discharge side of the compressor, the now hot and highly pressurized gas is cooled in a heat exchanger called a condenser until it condenses into a high pressure, moderate temperature liquid. The condensed refrigerant then passes through a pressure-lowering device like an expansion valve, capillary tube, or possibly a work-extracting device such as a turbine. This device then passes the low pressure, barely liquid (saturated vapor) refrigerant to another heat exchanger, the evaporator where the refrigerant evaporates into a gas via heat absorption. The refrigerant then returns to the compressor and the cycle is repeated.</p>
<p>In such a system it is essential that the refrigerant reaches a sufficiently high temperature when compressed, since the second law of thermodynamics prevents heat from flowing from a cold fluid to a hot heat sink. Similarly, the fluid must reach a sufficiently low temperature when allowed to expand, or heat cannot flow from the cold region into the fluid. In particular, the pressure difference must be great enough for the fluid to condense at the hot side and still evaporate in the lower pressure region at the cold side. The greater the temperature difference, the greater the required pressure difference, and consequently more energy is needed to compress the fluid. Thus as with all heat pumps, the energy efficiency (amount of heat moved per unit of input work required) decreases with increasing temperature difference.</p>
<p>Due to the variations required in temperatures and pressures, many different refrigerants are available. Refrigerators, air conditioners, and some heating systems are common applications that use this technology.</p>

<p>A HVAC heat pump system</p>
<p>In HVAC applications, a heat pump normally refers to a vapor-compression refrigeration device that includes a reversing valve and optimized heat exchangers so that the direction of heat flow may be reversed. The reversing valve switches the direction of refrigerant through the cycle and therefore the heat pump may deliver either heating or cooling to a building. In the cooler climates the default setting of the reversing valve is heating. The default setting in warmer climates is cooling. Because the two heat exchangers, the condenser and evaporator, must swap functions, they are optimized to perform adequately in both modes. As such, the efficiency of a reversible heat pump is typically slightly less than two separately-optimized machines.</p>

<p><span style="color: #e71902" class="Apple-style-span">I think the Peak Oil People are wrong. I think Oil Speculation has DOUBLED the price of oil. The Saudi&#8217;s claim that they believe oil is worth 70$$ a barrel. The real question is who tried to corner the Oil Market and Why? The second question is like the Hunt Brothers before them (in silver) when will they go to jail?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #e71902" class="Apple-style-span">A bigger question is will the Saudi&#8217;s give the money back that they made as a result? Unfortunately they may have screwed the pooch because people are switching to mass transit and scooters. </span></p>
