										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yah right. That is so laughable. Even after they announced that they were going to try to bring 5 nuclear plants on line there were no commercial backers and so the price went up before they even <em>started</em>. It has been all downhill since then.</p>

<p>Q: How many nuclear plants are under construction in the U.S.?</p>
<p>A: Three. Two nuclear reactors are being built at Plant Vogtle in  eastern Georgia. Two more reactors are under construction at Plant  Summer in central South Carolina. A fifth reactor mothballed in 1985 is  being finished at Plant Watts Bar in Tennessee.</p>
<p>Q: How often are nuclear plants built?</p>
<p>A: The last nuclear plant built in the United States was the existing reactor finished at Watts Bar in 1996.</p>
<p>Q: How much does a nuclear plant cost?</p>
<p>A: Billions of dollars. Nuclear plants are among the most complicated  and expensive infrastructure projects in the world. The plants require  incredible amounts of design and engineering work and must be built to  exacting safety standards. Federal inspectors can require that parts of  the plant be ripped out and replaced if they don&#8217;t meet muster. The  plants require huge amounts of metal, concrete, cables and wires.  Building two Westinghouse Electric Co. AP1000 reactors at Plant Vogtle  is supposed to cost roughly $14 billion, though the final expenses could  be more.</p>

<h3>Festival of Frugality: Superheroes Are Frugal Too Edition</h3>
<div>Hello and welcome to the 325th edition of the Festival of Frugality. The  Festival of Frugality highlights personal finance posts that deal with <em>how to pinch those pennies or save that dollar</em>.</div>
<p>I am a sucker for a theme for my festivals or carnivals and while I was  tempted to do a leap year facts edition it just wasn&#8217;t exciting enough  for my blood. So superheroes it is. Because what&#8217;s more exciting than  superheroes? It also occurred to me that superheroes are quite frugal  and who hasn&#8217;t sometimes thought that superpowers are needed to stay on  the path of frugality.</p>
<p>Editor&#8217;s Super Picks</p>
<blockquote><p>Smart Family Finance has pretty convincing <strong><a href="http://www.smartfamilyfinance.com/2012/02/financial-reasons-to-get-rid-of-your-junk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial reasons to get rid of your junk.</a> </strong>There are so may reasons to get rid of your &#8220;junk&#8221;. It&#8217;s nice to have one that will put cash in your wallet too.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Annabelle from Shopping Detox <a href="http://www.shoppingdetox.com/2012/02/jour-47-saskatoon-frugality-audit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gives her city a frugal audit. </a>This really has me thinking about my own town.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>A. Blinkin from Funancials entertains us as usual with <strong><a href="http://funancials.biz/how-do-you-judge-value/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how do you judge value?</a></strong></p></blockquote>

The obvious suspects are the Leaf, the Volt and the Prius. You will have to go read the article for their reveiws but here is the lead in.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/2011-best-green-cars-zm0z11zroc.aspx">http://www.motherearthnews.com/2011-best-green-cars-zm0z11zroc.aspx</a></p>
<h1>Best Green Cars, 2011</h1>
<p><strong><em>The hybrid  car that changed the world • The electric cars that will change the  world • $1,000s in rebates and incentives • 40 mpg for the long haul •  All-electric daily driving • 38 mpg with smiles • $2.75 to recharge • No  range anxiety • 35 mpg with zip</em></strong></p>
<p>June/July 2011</p>
<p><em>By John Rockhold</em></p>
<p>Back  in 2000, Toyota released the Prius, a gasoline-electric hybrid, in the  United States. That year, the average price of gas was just $1.49, yet  here was a quirky little car that touted 40-plus mpg. A 2004 redesign  gave the Prius even better mpg and its iconic shape, and it became so  popular Toyota couldn’t keep up with demand. Today, the Prius is the  most successful hybrid by far and has basically come to define “green  car.” It’s no surprise, then, that the Prius is back among the annual  MOTHER EARTH NEWS Best Green Cars.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what the  heck “Prius” actually means? It’s a Latin word meaning “to go before.”  Toyota chose it to signify that the car and its hybrid technology would  be a precursor of the energy-efficient cars of the future?—?which has  certainly proved true, given the numerous hybrids released by Toyota and  others. However, it’s the two <em>all-electric</em> cars on our 2011 list that herald the next revolution in green transportation.</p>
<p>Yes,  practical and accessible electric cars from major automakers are  finally here. Neither electric car is perfect, but the Prius wasn’t  either back in 2000. Of the many features that make the Chevrolet Volt  and Nissan Leaf compelling, their driving range and cost to own are what  may make them most appealing. The Leaf has a range of about 100 miles,  depending on driving conditions. The Volt has a shorter all-electric  range, but uses a gas engine to power its two electric motors when  needed for a total range of about 375 miles.</p>
<p>Sick of paying about  $50 to fill the tank of your gas car? How does $2 to $3 sound? Given  the national average cost of electricity (11 cents per kilowatt-hour),  that’s about what you would pay to “fill up” an electric car by  recharging it overnight. And if you’re curious about the environmental  costs of gasoline versus fossil fuel electricity, read <a title="Why Electric Cars Are Cleaner" href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/green-transportation/electric-cars-zm0z11zsto.aspx" target="_self" rel="noopener">Why Electric Cars Are Cleaner</a>.  In short, while there is regional variability, electric cars are  cleaner than gas cars. That said, the ultimate solution is to recharge  with renewable energy.</p>
<p>The three other vehicles that make up our  2011 Best Green Cars are revolutionary in their own right: The Ford  Fiesta has the best blend of affordability and efficiency; the Honda  CR-Z proves that hybrids can be fun to drive; and the Jetta TDI is the  best example of clean diesel’s efficiency and workhorse longevity.</p>
<p>Whether  you own one of these six cars now, later or never, you’ll benefit from  them. They’re making mobility greener, reducing our dependence on oil,  and instigating more innovation in the auto industry. In this new era of  green car competition, we’re all winners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Finns found this out real quick when they started their new Nuke 5 years ago costs estimates were 4 billion $$$. Right now they are at 7 billion $$$ and the meter is still turning. Even with 8 billion $$$ of backing for the two new reactors at the Vogle site Georgia Power could get no money in the private sector so they are &#8220;self financing&#8221;. Anybody want to buy a cheap power company someday? But this was the wind blowing through the trees in 2003 (and you should see the 2009 update for a good laugh) when we had a President that couldn&#8217;t even pronounce the word nuclear right.</p>

<h2><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/img/headings/introduction.gif" alt="Introduction" width="109" height="11" /></h2>
<p>An interdisciplinary MIT faculty group decided to study the  future of  nuclear power because of a belief that this technology is an  important option for the United States and the world to meet future  energy needs without emitting carbon dioxide and other atmospheric  pollutants. Other options include increased efficiency, renewables, and  carbon sequestration, and all may be needed for a successful greenhouse  gas management strategy. This study, addressed to government, industry,  and academic leaders, discusses the interrelated technical, economic,  environmental, and political challenges facing a significant increase in  global nuclear power utilization over the next half century and what  might be done to overcome those challenges.</p>
<p>This study was supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation  and by MIT&#8217;s Office of the Provost and Laboratory for Energy and the  Environment.</p>

<h2><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/img/headings/newsrelease.gif" alt="News Release" width="110" height="11" /></h2>
<p>MIT RELEASES INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDY ON &#8220;THE FUTURE OF NUCLEAR ENERGY&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Professors John Deutch and Ernest Moniz Chaired Effort to Identify Barriers and Solutions             for Nuclear Option in Reducing Greenhouse Gases</em></p>
<p><em>July 29, 2003</em></p>
<p>Washington, D.C. — A distinguished team of researchers from  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard released  today what co-chair Dr. John Deutch calls &#8220;the most comprehensive,  interdisciplinary study ever conducted on the future of nuclear energy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report maintains that &#8220;The nuclear option should be  retained precisely because it is an important carbon-free source of  power.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fossil fuel-based electricity is projected to account for  more than 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2020,&#8221; said Deutch.   &#8220;In the U.S. 90% of the carbon emissions from electricity generation  come from coal-fired generation, even though this accounts for only 52%  of the electricity produced.  Taking nuclear power off the table as a  viable alternative will prevent the global community from achieving  long-term gains in the control of carbon dioxide emissions.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the prospects for nuclear energy as an option are limited, the report finds, by four unresolved problems: <em>high  relative costs; perceived adverse safety, environmental, and health  effects; potential security risks stemming from proliferation; and  unresolved challenges in long-term management of nuclear wastes</em>.</p>
<p>The study examines a growth scenario where the present  deployment of 360 GWe of nuclear capacity worldwide is expanded to 1000  GWe in mid-century, keeping nuclear&#8217;s share of the electricity market  about constant.  Deployment in the U.S. would expand from about 100 GWe  today to 300 GWe in mid-century.  This scenario is not a prediction, but  rather a study case in which nuclear power would make a significant  contribution to reducing CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no question that the up-front costs associated  with making nuclear power competitive, are higher than those associated  with fossil fuels,&#8221; said Dr. Moniz.  &#8220;But as our study shows, there are  many ways to mitigate these costs and, over time, the societal and  environmental price of carbon emissions could dramatically improve the  competitiveness of nuclear power&#8221;</p>
<p>The study offers a number of recommendations for making the nuclear energy option viable, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Placing increased emphasis on the once-through fuel  cycle as best meeting the criteria of low costs and proliferation  resistance;</li>
<li>Offering a limited production tax-credit to &#8216;first  movers&#8217; &#8211; private sector investors who successfully build new nuclear  plants.  This tax credit is extendable to other carbon-free electricity  technologies and is not paid unless the plant operates;</li>
<li>Having government more fully develop the capabilities to analyze life-cycle health and safety impacts of fuel cycle facilities;</li>
<li>Advancing a U.S. Department of Energy balanced long-term waste management R&amp;D program.</li>
<li>Urging DOE to establish a Nuclear System Modeling  project that would collect the engineering data and perform the analysis  necessary to evaluate alternative reactor concepts and fuel cycles  using the criteria of cost, safety, waste, and proliferation resistance.   Expensive development projects should be delayed pending the outcome  of this multi-year effort.</li>
<li>Giving countries that forego proliferation- risky  enrichment and reprocessing activities a preferred position to receive  nuclear fuel and waste management services from nations that operate the  entire fuel cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>The authors of the study emphasized that nuclear power is  not the only non-carbon option and stated that they believe it should be  pursued as a long term option along with other options such as the use  of renewable energy sources, increased efficiency, and carbon  sequestration..</p>
<p>The members of the study team are: John Deutch (co-chair),  Ernest Moniz (co-chair), S. Ansolabehere, Michael Driscoll, Paul Gray,  John Holdren (Harvard), Paul Joskow, Richard Lester, and Neil Todreas.</p>
<p>Members of the Advisory Committee included: former U.S.  Congressman Phil Sharp (chair), former White House Chiefs of Staff John  Podesta and John Sununu, John Ahearne, Tom Cochran, Linn Draper, Ted  Greenwood, John MacWilliams, Jessica Mathews, Zack Pate, and Mason  Willrich.</p>
<p>This study was supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation  and by MIT&#8217;s Office of the Provost and Laboratory for Energy and the  Environment.</p>

<p>Five Models of Energy Efficiency: A Guide to Beautiful, Energy-Efficient Homes</p>
<p>Five US builders are being honored for their exceptional achievements in high performance building at the second annual BASF <a href="http://www.hgtvpro.com/hpro/green_building/article/0,3142,HPRO_27916_5942677,00.html">Builders Challenge</a> Awards.</p>
<p>Led by the U.S Department of Energy (DOE), the Builders  Challenge is working with homebuilders across America to build a new  generation of high-performance homes, working toward the ultimate goal  of providing cost-effective, net-zero energy homes by 2030  for all  Americans.</p>
<p>To qualify for the Builders Challenge, homes must meet at least a 70 on the <a href="http://www.hgtvpro.com/hpro/green_building/article/0,3142,HPRO_27916_5946464,00.html">EnergySmart Home Scale (E-Scale)</a> &#8212; which means they must use at least 30 percent less energy than a typical new home built to code.</p>

<p>Sure, you  might get a carpool sticker and a tax break. But if you buy an electric  car, will it make much environmental difference?</p>
<p>Experts say that  depends on three factors: What were you driving before? How is your  electricity generated? And how many other electric cars are going to be  sold?</p>
<p>In many cases, people who trade gasoline-powered cars for  electric ones won&#8217;t be dramatically lessening the smog they emit. But  when it comes to global warming, even when emissions from generating the  electricity are taken into account, electric vehicles have a much  smaller carbon footprint than gas-powered vehicles because they are much  more efficient. However, it will take a decade or more until enough  electric vehicles are on the road to make a significant impact.</p>
<p>&#8220;If  you have a person who is driving a nice, newer car, having them switch  to an electric car, there isn&#8217;t going to be much benefit in reducing  smog,&#8221; said Tom Cahill, a professor emeritus of physics at UC Davis.  &#8220;But there could be a whole lot of gain in climate change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because  all-electric vehicles like the Nissan Leaf burn no fossil fuels, and  plug-in hybrids like the Chevy Volt burn only small amounts of gasoline,  tailpipe emissions from electric cars are basically zero. In smoggy  cities like Los Angeles, driving one on summer days may actually clean  the air because the tailpipe emissions contain less pollution than the  air.</p>
<p>Yet most people currently buying electric cars weren&#8217;t driving old,  smog-belching vehicles. They are often affluent motorists who drove  newer-model gasoline cars. And because California has for 50 years had  the toughest tailpipe standards in the nation, a 2010 gasoline-burning  car puts out only 2 percent or less of the pollution spewed by a 1980s  model.</p>
<p>Along with the national-security benefits of reducing  America&#8217;s use of foreign oil, the main societal benefit of electric cars  might be their dramatically smaller global warming footprint.</p>
<p>A 2008 study by  researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that life-cycle  greenhouse gas emissions, which include emissions from both  manufacturing and operating a vehicle, are 32 percent less from plug-in  hybrids than from gasoline-powered cars.</p>
<p>That finding was based  on America&#8217;s electricity mix: 45 percent of U.S. electricity is  generated from coal, 23 percent from natural gas, 20 percent from  nuclear, and 12 percent from dams, solar, wind and other sources.</p>
<p>The  global warming footprint of electric cars varies by region. Some states  get nearly all their electricity from coal, the most polluting fuel.  But only 15 percent of California&#8217;s electricity comes from coal, nearly  all imported from other states, with 46 percent from natural gas, 15  percent from nuclear power, and 24 percent from dams, solar, wind and  other sources.</p>

<h1><strong>Nuclear Power Industry Praying Japan Will Avert a Nuclear Disaster </strong></h1>
<p><a href="http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Topic10.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stock-Markets</a> / <a href="http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/News-catid-239.html">Nuclear Power</a> Mar 14, 2011 &#8211; 10:59 AM</p>

<p>Explosions and meltdowns at nuclear reactors in Japan this past weekend will   forever change the world of energy.</p>
<p>Authorities have already scheduled widespread power outages starting  today —   and they could continue the planned outages for weeks or even  months.</p>

<p>But that’s just a metaphor for the sustained global energy  shortages that are   likely, as the safety and long-term viability of  nuclear power comes under more   intense scrutiny than at any time in  history.</p>
<p>How do we know that’s the likely outcome?</p>
<p>Because prior nuclear disasters, such as Three Mile Island and  Chernobyl, had   a major long-term impact on nuclear plant construction.</p>
<p>Moreover, those two disasters were ultimately written off to  antiquated   facilities or poor safety precautions. In contrast, the  Japanese nuclear   industry prides itself on safety, and the plants  struck by the earthquake had   far better staff training and equipment,  including multiple back-up systems, all   of which failed.</p>
<p>Some nuclear experts will counter that newer and safer technologies  now exist   or can be developed. But given the history of similar  promises in the past,   those are bound to fall on deaf ears.</p>
<p>The public will now ask …</p>
<p><strong>Is there a fundamental incompatibility between  the  potential   dangers of nuclear energy and  the unpredictable wrath of  Mother Nature? </strong></p>
<p>That question defies any quick answer and could take years to  resolve. Until   then, further growth in nuclear power production could  be drastically reduced,   with potentially far-reaching consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chronic global energy shortages, especially in countries that  were counting   on new nuclear energy for a large portion of their  electric power.</li>
<li>Massive, long-term upward pressure on crude oil prices as  producers,   consumers, and investors upwardly revise their forecasts of  fossil fuel demand.</li>
<li>Vast sums of investor money diverted from nuclear power plant  construction   to other alternative energy sources, such as wind, solar,  and bio-fuels.</li>
</ul>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Still battling viruses. So hopefully more tomorrow.</p>

<h1>Newt Gingrich on Energy &amp; Oil</h1>
<h2>Former Republican Representative (GA-6) and Speaker of the House</h2>
<h3>Kyoto treaty is bad for the environment and bad for America</h3>
<p>Kyoto is a bad treaty. It is bad for the environment and it is bad for  America. It sets standards that will require massive investments by the  US but virtually no investments by other countries. The Senate was right  when it voted unanimously against the treaty. We should insist on revisiting the entire Kyoto process and  resolutely reject efforts to force us into an anti-American,  environmentally failed treaty.</p>
<p>The US should support substantial  research into climate science, managing the response to climate change, &amp; in developing new non-carbon energy systems. It is  astounding to watch people blithely propose trillions of dollars in  spending on a topic on which we have failed to spend modest amounts to  better understand.</p>
<p>It is astounding to have people focus myopically on carbon as the sole source of climate change.  The world’s climate has changed in the past with sudden speed and  dramatic impact. Global warming may happen. On the other hand it is  possible Europe will experience another ice age.</p>

<h3>Focus on incentives for conservation &amp; renewable resources</h3>
<p>A sound American energy policy would focus on four areas: basic research  to create a new energy system that has few environmental side effects,  incentives for conservation, more renewable resources, and  environmentally sound development of fossil fuels. The Bush administration has approached energy environmentalism the right  way, including using public-private partnerships that balance economic  costs and environmental gain.</p>
<p>Hydrogen has the potential to provide  energy that has no environmental downside. Conservation is the second great opportunity in energy. A tax  credit to subsidize energy efficient cars (including a tax credit for  turning in old and heavily polluting cars) is another idea we should  support. Renewable resources are gradually evolving to meet their potential: from wind generator farms to solar  power to biomass conversion. Continued tax credits and other advantages  for renewable resources are a must.</p>

<h3>Stop scare tactics about drilling in Alaska</h3>
<p>It is time for an honest debate about drilling and producing in places  like Alaska, our national forests, and off the coast of scenic areas.  The Left uses scare tactics from a different era to block  environmentally sound production of raw materials. Three standards should break through this deadlock.</p>
<ol>
<li>Scientists  of impeccable background should help set the standards for sustaining  the environment in sensitive areas, and any company entering the areas  should be bonded to meet those standards.</li>
<li>The public should be informed about new methods of production  that can meet the environmental standards, and any development should be  only with those new methods.</li>
<li>A percentage of the revenues from  resources generated in environmentally sensitive areas should be dedicated to environmental activities  including biodiversity sustainment, land acquisition, and environmental  cleanups in places where there are no private resources that can be used  to clean up past problems.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Gas tax sounds OK in DC, but not outside Beltway</h3>
<p>When the Bush Administration tried to convince me that a gasoline tax  increase would be okay and would barely be noticed, I tested the theory  with two phone calls. First I called my mother-in-law in Leetonia, Ohio,  and then I called my older daughter in Greensboro, North Carolina. My mother-in-law is retired, at the time,  aged 75. She has a lot of friends who live on limited incomes, and  driving happens to be one of their pleasures. She was personally against  the idea of a gas tax increase, and she thought the idea would go down very badly with her friends. Then I  called my daughter Kathy. She runs a small business, and her husband is  the tennis coach at the university. Her reaction was, to put it mildly,  scathing. “What planet do they live on?” she asked. She thought such a tax increase was the very antithesis of  why people had elected the Republicans. After those two conversations,  any doubts I may have had simply vanished, and I opposed the tax  increase. <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: xx-small;"> Source: <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/The_Hard_Way.htm">Lessons Learned the Hard Way, by Newt Gingrich, p. 29-30</a> Jul 2, 1998 </span></p>
