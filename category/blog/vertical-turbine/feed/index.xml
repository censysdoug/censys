										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This should have happened 10 years ago on every shoreline in America. Let me be clear. Not every spot off the coast is eligible for wind turbines. And I believe that factors like scenery and inhabitant acceptance are factors to be weighed with as much importance as wind force and need, none the less these evaluations need to be done and done quickly. Long overdue aside, they need to get moving. The man makes a very good point, that the oil and gas business prepared a workforce for this.</p>

<h1 class="headline">Michael Hecht: Wind power generation has a great future in the Gulf of Mexico</h1>

<li class="hidden-print"><time class="tnt-date asset-date text-muted" datetime="2021-06-17T18:00:00-05:00">Jun 17, 2021 &#8211; 6:00 pm</time></li>

<p>This week, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), federal lead agency for offshore wind, is holding the inaugural meeting of the Gulf of Mexico Intergovernmental Renewable Energy Task Force. Although the task force is composed of elected officials from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, it was Louisiana, under the leadership of Gov. John Bel Edwards, who launched the process for the establishment of this regional Task Force — thereby paving the way for the exploration of offshore wind</p>
<p>This is because we can capitalize on wind energy in two related but distinct ways: first, from the manufacturing and servicing of offshore wind structures along the Atlantic coast; and then, from the eventual deployment of offshore wind structures in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Many of the assets and skills from Louisiana’s decades as a hub for offshore oil and gas exploration and production translate directly into offshore wind. These include our large port infrastructure; structural manufacturing expertise; world-class engineering; world-class vessel building; extensive offshore marine services; and an unbeatable workforce.</p>

<p>Go there and read. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During this pandemic I have been getting rid of my housitis by driving around in my car. No touching. No talking. Just driving. At first it was close to Riverton, like to Williamsville or places in Springfield like Lincoln Land Community College or Washington Park. One day I thought, &#8220;Let&#8217;s drive to Mt. Pulaski&#8221; which is about 20 miles away maybe. I had forgotten that they had built a wind farm just shy of there. What a glorious sight. Right along the highway. I was amazed. I pulled off the road in wonder. My faith in humanity was renewed.</p>
<p>(I know this is a company site but it has wonderful Pictures. I can neither vouch for this company nor advise any sort of dealings with this company. I am simply reposting its website)</p>

<h1 class="hero_title text--page-heading">HillTopper wind farm creates energy solutions for a sustainable future</h1>
<p class="hero_date text--date">Published on Thursday, 17 January 2019</p>
<p>excerpted:</p>
<h2><b>A Wind Farm “Made in the USA”</b></h2>
<p>Located in <b>Illinois</b>, the US state with the sixth highest installed wind capacity, HillTopper is an example of how our projects contribute to local socio-economic development.</p>
<p>By purchasing wind turbines produced from a local business, HillTopper contributed <b>50 million dollars directly to the local economy</b>: a clear example of the care Enel Green Power has for the communities that welcome us. As Enel Green Power, we provide sustainable, clean, reliable and affordable energy to several companies, with the goal of creating new value in the heart of Illinois.</p>
<p>The 185-MW wind farm uses <b>General Electric</b> turbines manufactured in the United States and, through a collaboration with <b>Trinity Structural Towers</b>, located just a few kilometers from the site, we’re fostering the growth of the local economy.</p>
<p>The local manufacturer provided about half of HillTopper’s 74 turbines. At nearly 90 meters tall, they provide <b>570 GWh</b> of energy every year. This power can cover the energy needs of more than <b>46,300</b> American households.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and read all their corporate speak. But look at the picture and imagine the possibilities. More next week.</p>

<p>HAVANA — The Mason County Board took the first step Tuesday toward adopting an ordinance to regulate wind farms in unincorporated Mason County. With several proposed wind farms throughout the county, Mason will soon follow in the footsteps of other central Illinois communities and be host to the wind powered energy sources.The board did a first reading of the ordinance Tuesday, said City Clerk Bill Blessman. Adoption of the ordinance will be considered at the county board’s May meeting, he said. The main point in Tuesday’s reading, said Blessman, was to make the proposed ordinance available for public viewing.</p>
<p>The proposed ordinance sets forth various regulations for turbines and wind farms built in Mason County. According to the ordinance, 1,000-foot setbacks are required between towers and any primary structure, and all towers must be placed at least 1.1 times the tower’s height from public roads, transmission lines and communication towers.</p>

<p>Two different wind farm corporations have been securing leases in Mason County, according to county officials, who say the tax revenue a wind farm could bring would be welcome.</p>
<p>Mason County Board member James Miller said two wind energy companies have secured leases in Mason County, though the specifics of the companies’ plans are still unclear. The securing of leases is typically the first thing wind companies do before testing and, ultimately, obtaining the permits to erect the turbines. Overall, the process can take a few years.</p>
<p>However, when completed, the wind farms could prove a financial boon for the county which has lost population since the 2000 census — something that affects tax revenue for local governments in the county.</p>
<p>“The county would love to have (the wind farms), and for the school districts this is a big deal,” Miller said. “Some one or two or three of them would benefit.”</p>

<p>Please notice the last article was in 2011. 9 years later it is still &#8220;ongoing&#8221;/ At this rate they will put up the turbines when the prairie catches on fire.</p>

<p>Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO) has signed a memorandum of understanding with Danish energy business Orsted to work together on offshore wind projects.</p>
<p>In an announcement Friday, TEPCO said that it had been &#8220;exploring offshore wind business opportunities&#8221; in both Japan and overseas. Orsted is a world leader in wind energy and built the world&#8217;s first offshore wind facility in 1991.</p>
<p>TEPCO said that the two companies would work on the Choshi offshore wind project. In November 2018, TEPCO announced that it had been carrying out a seabed survey to assess the feasibility of the project. They will also work towards what was described as a &#8220;strategic partnership for broader collaboration.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This method of generation will only go up from here. But here is something most people don&#8217;t consider, at sea drilling for oil and wind farms are incompatible. You can not drill anywhere near wind turbines because of the possibility of oil spills. There is a good chance those spills would ignite. That is not the case with other spills or even explosions and fires. Because they are easily put out. But when you have an electrical source, those fires are guaranteed and would be difficult to extinguish. So all you have to do to stop off shore drilling is build wind farms. Mark my words, when some hotshot wind person builds a wind farm over a proven oil deposit, oil is dead.</p>

<h1 class="article__title">After an Uncertain Start, U.S. Offshore Wind Is Powering Up</h1>
<div class="article__dek">
<p>After years of delays, the U.S. offshore wind industry is finally gaining momentum, with new projects being planned along the Atlantic coast. So far, the Trump administration seems to be regarding offshore wind as one form of renewable energy it can support.</p>

<h1>The Dutch plan to build an artificial island to support the world’s largest wind farm</h1>
<p>Wind farms need a lot of space—not something the world has much to spare. That’s why they’re being pushed out into the sea.</p>
<p>TenneT, the operator of the Netherlands’ electric grid, has come up with an ambitious plan to build an artificial island in the middle of the North Sea that on completion would support the world’s largest wind farm.</p>
<p>The location for the artificial island is a region called the Dogger Bank, about 100 km (60 miles) off the coast of Yorkshire in the UK. During the last Ice Age some 20,000 years ago, when sea levels were 100 meters lower than today, Dogger Bank was actually a landmass called Doggerland, which connected mainland Europe to the British isles. The bank’s shallowness means it won’t require ungodly amounts of sand to build the island, and it will be able to support the thousands of wind turbines that need to be tethered to the sea floor. Its location also puts any electricity generated from the farm within reach of five countries.</p>
<p>Wind power generators are searching for better locations because wind farms are a much less dense form of electricity generation compared to fossil-fuel power or nuclear power. A nuclear power plant can generate 400 times as much energy per unit of area compared to a wind farm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of course Illinois has already gone for wind in a big way so I should not complain. Well I could complain about Sangamon County because of its stupid rules about wind turbines. That is for another time. For now, how glorious it would have been talking offshore wind farms in New Orleans? Over beignets no less.</p>
<p><a href="https://longreads.com/2017/08/23/louisiana-wind-farms/">Why Oil-Loving Louisiana Should Embrace America’s Coming Offshore Wind&nbsp;Boom</a></p>

<h1 class="entry-title"><a title="Why Oil-Loving Louisiana Should Embrace America’s Coming Offshore Wind Boom" href="https://longreads.com/2017/08/23/louisiana-wind-farms/" rel="bookmark">Why Oil-Loving Louisiana Should Embrace America’s Coming Offshore Wind Boom</a></h1>
<p>The budding wind power industry is rich in jobs, and the people of south Louisiana are ready for clean energy.</p>
</header>
<p><em><a href="http://www.justinnobel.com/">Justin Nobel</a> | Longreads | July 2017 | 16 minutes (4,000 words)</em></p>
<p>If you’re visiting New Orleans and want to see something truly amazing, take your beer or daiquiri to-go and walk a few blocks past the Superdome—you’ll find a school being constructed on an old waste dump.</p>
<p>“All the toxic chemicals from the landfill are still there,” says toxicologist Wilma Subra. This includes lead, mercury, and arsenic, exposure to which can lead to reproductive damage, and skin and lung cancer. Even more astonishing, Subra says hundreds of schools across Louisiana have been built on waste dumps. Why? Dumps represent cheap land often already owned by a cash-strapped town or city, plus serve as rare high ground in a flood-prone state. And this is just the beginning of Louisiana’s nightmare.</p>
<p>The risk of cancer in Reserve, a community founded by freed slaves, is 800 times the national average, making the community, by one EPA metric, the most carcinogenic census tract in America—the cause is a DuPont/Denka chemical plant adjacent to the town that annually spews 250,000 pounds of the <em>likely carcinogen </em>chloroprene into the air. If you think the situation in Flint is bad, there are approximately 400 public water systems in Louisiana with lead or other hazardous substances leaching into the drinking water. Meanwhile, hundreds of petrochemical plants peppered across the state’s lush swampy interior freely emit carcinogens, endocrine disruptors, and neurotoxins into the air and water, as well as inject them deep into the earth.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s no surprise that Louisiana is ranked, according to different surveys, 47th in environmental quality, third in poverty, and 49th in education. Are you still gushing about your latest trip to New Orleans for <em>Jazz Fest Presented by Shell</em>, or <em>French Quarter Festival presented by Chevron</em>? “New Orleans is the best,” one visitor recently wrote to me, “you are so smart to live there!” But how smart is it to allow children to attend school built on toxin-laced waste? How smart is it to allow a community’s cancer rates to shoot off the charts? Louisiana is rich in culture, spirit, and faith, yet what type of state knowingly poisons its own people? What type of country stands by and allows it to happen?</p>
<p>While it is fashionable to critique President Trump for his scientific ignorance, science was misdirected long before Trump laid hands on it. It is time to open our eyes and see what is really going on in this world, to critique our society’s dinosaur methods, then step back and imagine what a new path forward might look like. It is with this aim that I begin a science column for Longreads. In my first story I’ll tour us through a land America should have never allowed to materialize—it’s what I’m calling the <em>Louisiana Environmental Apocalypse Road Trip</em>. As the Trump administration chucks environmental science out the window, evaporates industry regulations, and cripples agencies charged with protecting the environment, this tale is relevant for all Americans, because the poisoning happening in Louisiana could happen in your state too—in fact, it is probably already happening.</p>

<p>The revolutionary technology will allow wind power to be harvested in waters too deep for the current conventional bottom-standing turbines.</p>
<p>The Peterhead wind farm, known as Hywind, is a trial which will bring power to 20,000 homes.</p>
<p>Manufacturer Statoil says output from the turbines is expected to equal or surpass generation from current ones.</p>
<p>It hopes to cash in on a boom in the technology, especially in Japan and the west coast of the US, where waters are deep.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a tech development project to ensure it&#8217;s working in open sea conditions. It&#8217;s a game-changer for floating wind power and we are sure it will help bring costs down,&#8221; said Leif Delp, project director for Hywind.</p>

<div id="article-description">The Swiss voted on Sunday in favour of a massive overhaul of the country&#8217;s energy system by gradually replacing the power from its ageing nuclear reactors with renewable sources.</div>
<div id="article-body">
<div>A full 58.2 percent of Swiss voters supported the shift, according to a final tally after Sunday&#8217;s referendum, with only four of the country&#8217;s 26 cantons voting &#8220;no&#8221;.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;This is a historic day for the country,&#8221; Green Party parliamentarian Adele Thorens Goumaz told public broadcaster RTS.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;Switzerland will finally enter into the 21st century when it comes to energy.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The move has been in the making since shortly after Japan&#8217;s Fukushima nuclear plant was destroyed in the March 2011 tsunami disaster, when the Swiss government decided to gradually close its nuclear plants.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Instead, it aims to increase reliance on hydraulic power as well as renewables like solar, wind, geothermal and biomass.</div>

<div class="entry">
<p>After doing some research on renewable energy systems or alternative energy systems as many will call them, I wanted to get the information out there as far as the advantages and disadvantages of the 2 main renewable energy systems, <a title="wind turbine generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind turbine generators</a> and <a title="photovoltaic solar panels" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">photovoltaic solar panels</a>.</p>
<p>Both <a title="solar panel" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panel</a> and <a title="wind generator systems" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator systems</a> are similar as far as how they are setup. You can have the <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> grid tied or off grid, same as <a title="solar panels" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panels</a>. Both the <a title="solar panel photovoltaic panel" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panel (photovoltaic panel)</a> and <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> will need a battery bank if you are using an off grid system. Both of these renewable energy systems will produce clean energy and help the environment as well as save you money in your home!</p>
<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Wind Generator Systems and Solar Panel Systems</h3>
<p>Now onto some of the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative energy system. None of this information is from my own personal experience as I do not have the financial funds to support the research. So the information about these renewable energy systems have came from researching the internet, talking to people that have these alternative energy systems, and of course some calculations of my own (prices, efficiency, etc.).</p>
<h3>Wind Turbine Generator System Pros and Cons</h3>
<p>The main advantage of <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> is that they can produce electricity day or night as long as there is wind. <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">Wind generators</a> need less space on your land to produce sufficient electricity. <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">Wind generators</a> are able to produce more electric for the same price. If you spend $1,000.00 on <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> you can produce 1kW – 2kW, with <a title="solar panels" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panels</a> you may only produce around .5kW – .75kW with the same $1,000.00. <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generators" target="_blank">Wind generators</a> have moving parts, so there is always wear and tear on these moving parts. Bearings can go bad, propeller blades can be struck by objects, and heat may be generated. Your <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> will be installed on a tower or pole of some sort to gain height where there is more wind, allowing lighting to possibly strike your <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a>. As wind hits the propeller blades there will be noise created, think of a fan and how they sound, or even taking a rope and swinging it fast in circles. You will get some of this noise from your <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a>. The propellers of the <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> can also produce shadows flickering. Birds can get killed from flying into your wind generator’s propellers. There are vertical <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generators</a> which will prevent this. So the quick break down of the <a title="wind generator system" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator system</a>:</p>
