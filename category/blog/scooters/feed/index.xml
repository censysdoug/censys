										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was electricity from coal before there was gasoline driven cars. Still they are a big part of the problem. As other people have pointed out we are literally forced to drive. That is not to overlook the damage that big ocean ships and airplanes. I mean, Coal, Oil, Hot Asphalt and kerosene are the Big Four of Death.</p>
<p>Still it is hard to deny the seduction of the gasoline internal combustion engine. I got my first one when i was 14. It was a 90 cc Honda Motorcycle and it meant freedom to me. I could go from small town to small town in central Illinois. Meet new people, make new friends for a Quarter (.25$) per Gallon of gas. In fact I met my first true love who was riding a dirt bike on a back road blacktop, on the Honda.</p>
<p>How was I to know how dangerous they are, and that does not include the ones killed by operating them.</p>

<p>The summer I was eighteen, I visited a parking lot forty-five minutes north of town and got behind the wheel for what I hoped would be the first real rite of my adulthood. I was tall, gangly, excitable. Less than a week earlier, following a brief stretch of test-taking at the Department of Motor Vehicles in San Francisco, I had received my learner’s permit. Learning in those days seemed easy. Tests were easy. Doing—when the matter arose at all—was hard. Behind the wheel, I made a show of adjusting the mirrors, as if preparing for a ten-mile journey in reverse. I surveyed the blank pavement ahead of me and slowly slid the gear-shift from park into drive.</p>
<p>Cars had been my first passion. As a two-year-old, I’d learned to recognize the make of vehicles by the logo near the fender or perched on the hood. I grew to understand the people in my life according to their cars; I learned what sort of person <em class="">I</em> was from my parents’ two old Hondas, one of which, a used beige Accord, I had gone with them to buy. My father’s lingering bachelor vehicle, a rotting yellow Civic, needed to be choked awake on dewy mornings, and I’d performed that job with relish, pulling out the knob beside the steering wheel, waiting a long moment, and pushing it back. This was the late eighties. Gas prices had fallen, and the roads were knotty with cars from across the world. I no longer remember what, as a small child, I envisaged for my future, but I know that it involved moving at speed behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Now, all those years later, the parking lot was virtually empty of cars, and I felt a flush of reassurance. I was learning in my parents’ highly defatigable ride, a minivan with an all-plastic interior and the turning radius of a dump truck. My teacher was my father, a flawless but not wholly valiant driver, who habitually refused to drive on certain bridges in certain directions, for fear of being, as he would put it, “hypnotized” by trusses passing alongside the road. For reasons lost to time, my little sister was on board, too, in the back. I eased my foot onto the gas; the engine revved for a moment, and the van lurched.</p>

<h1>Tesla Motors Launches Revolutionary Supercharger Enabling Convenient Long Distance Driving</h1>
<p><a href="http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0LkuYg8PmJQDVIAfgOVuodG;_ylu=X3oDMTFqMDgxZXM0BG1pdANBcnRpY2xlIEJvZHkEcG9zAzEEc2VjA01lZGlhQXJ0aWNsZUJvZHlBc3NlbWJseQ--;_ylg=X3oDMTJuaGNnbWgyBGludGwDdXMEbGFuZwNlbi11cwRwc3RhaWQDMDg3NWNjMjEtY2EwNS0zZDQ3LWFjM2QtMjc3NmNmODgzZjA4BHBzdGNhdANuZXdzBHB0A3N0b3J5cGFnZQ--;_ylv=0/SIG=147r0j223/EXP=1349825340/**http%3A//ctt.marketwire.com/%3Frelease=934348%26id=2062909%26type=1%26url=http%253a%252f%252fwww.teslamotors.com%252f">Tesla Motors</a>(  NASDAQ : TSLA ) today unveiled its highly anticipated Supercharger  network. Constructed in secret, Tesla revealed the locations of the  first six Supercharger stations, which will allow the Model S to travel  long distances with ultra fast charging throughout California, parts of  Nevada and Arizona.</p>
<p>The technology at the heart of the Supercharger was developed  internally and leverages the economies of scale of existing charging  technology already used by the Model S, enabling Tesla to create the  Supercharger device at minimal cost. The electricity used by the  Supercharger comes from a solar carport system provided by SolarCity,  which results in almost zero marginal energy cost after installation.  Combining these two factors, Tesla is able to provide Model S owners<sup>1</sup> free long distance travel indefinitely.</p>
<p>Each solar power system is designed to generate more energy from the  sun over the course of a year than is consumed by Tesla vehicles using  the Supercharger. This results in a slight net <em>positive</em> transfer of sunlight generated power back to the electricity grid. In  addition to lowering the cost of electricity, this addresses a commonly  held misunderstanding that charging an electric car simply pushes carbon  emissions to the power plant. The Supercharger system will always  generate more power from sunlight than Model S customers use for  driving. By adding even a small solar system at their home, electric car  owners can extend this same principle to local city driving too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I usually do a series of car posts every year, and maybe this is the time to do it. I know starting on a Friday is kind of obtuse but heh it gives me a couple of days to look at cools sites and cars before I do another post. These are hybrids but the real moves have been in all electric.</p>
<h1>Five Hybrid Concept Cars We REALLY Want To Drive</h1>
<div id="byline">
<div>By <a href="http://www.highgearmedia.com/user/10009362_antony-ingram"> <img decoding="async" src="http://images.thecarconnection.com/sml/avatar-image-for-aingram-ace_100327516_s.jpg" alt="Antony Ingram" /> </a> <a title="View Antony Ingram's Profile" rel="author noopener" href="http://www.highgearmedia.com/user/10009362_antony-ingram" target="_blank">Antony Ingram</a></div>
</div>
<div>Jun 22, 2012</div>
<p>Every now and then, we allow our thoughts to drift here at GreenCarReports.</p>
<p>Naturally, we&#8217;re thinking forward rather than back, and often to the cars we might be driving around in five or ten years time.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve compiled a list of five concept cars seen at auto shows over  the last year or so. All are hybrids, and all showcase exciting new  visions of styling and technology that could well hit the roads in the  near future.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1073790_hyundai-i-oniq-plug-in-hybrid-coupe-concept-geneva-live-photos" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Hyundai i-Oniq</strong></a></p>
<p>Given the meteoric rise of Korean brands Hyundai and Kia over the  last few decades, it&#8217;s only right that they should play a part in our  future too. The i-Oniq concept car, revealed at the <a href="http://www.greencarreports.com/news/geneva-motor-show" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2012 Geneva Motor Show</a> back in March, is a sleek, two-door range-extended hybrid.</p>
<p>Though the styling evokes images of a huge engine under the hood, the  concept uses a tiny 1.0-liter 3-cylinder unit, supplying power to a  107-horsepower electric motor when its 75-mile battery range is  depleted. We&#8217;re pretty confident that 75 miles would cover most of our  day-to-day driving, but that little gasoline engine would provide a  useful extra 360 miles.</p>
<p>And you know what? It looks pretty good too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>That is one of 5. Go there and read. Pretty pictures too. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I get requests for guest posts and links all the time. Some are just pretend commercial sites. If they are on topic and interesting sometimes I give them a link or even a post but the legitimate ones I always put up. This one came in while I was posting about nuclear power and I couldn&#8217;t figure out a way to work it in. So here is an interesting guy, Evan Collins take on all electric vehicles.<br />
<a href="http://www.all-electric-vehicles.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.all-electric-vehicles.com</a><br />

<h1>All Electric Vehicles: My Search for the Perfect Electric Car (or hybrid, scooter, bicycle, or motorcycle!!)</h1>
<p><strong>Have you ever thought about Switching your Transport to an Electric Vehicle?</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re like me or the people I know, <strong>probably not!</strong> &#8230; at least not up to recently.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" title="electric vehicles" src="http://www.all-electric-vehicles.com/image-files/electric_car_nice_mycar.jpg" alt="electric vehicles" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="200" height="131" align="right" /> You may have noticed that, as of today, electric vehicles account for a  TINY percentage of all the cars, motorbikes, scooters and bicycles on  sale.</p>
<p>The thing is, it seems to be becoming more widely believed that electric vehicles will be the <strong>main type of transport</strong> around the world within 10 years.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" title="electric vehicles" src="http://www.all-electric-vehicles.com/image-files/evan-vectrix-1.jpg" alt="electric vehicles" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="250" height="192" align="left" /><br />
Hi there, my name is <a href="http://www.all-electric-vehicles.com/about-me.html">Evan Collins</a>. I&#8217;m a Mechanical engineering student and  live just outside Cork City in Ireland.</p>
<p>Like most guys (and students) my age, I don&#8217;t have much of my own money &#8230; <strong>but I do need to get around!</strong></p>
<p>I got my car licence a couple of years back and that&#8217;s what led to me to talking to you here today.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" title="electric vehicles" src="http://www.all-electric-vehicles.com/image-files/evt168-1.jpg" alt="electric vehicles" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="200" height="227" align="right" /> You see, my parents have insured me on their little Peugeot 207 diesel &#8211; and while that&#8217;s great &#8211;  I have some ideas of my own for the future when it comes to car ownership.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m not exactly a dedicated environmentalist, I have come to realise that if I want to get my  own set of four-wheels &#8211; one that I <strong>can actually afford</strong> in the next couple of years, then I&#8217;m going to take a different approach.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research all of the pros and cons of electric vehicles &#8211;  what&#8217;s on the market now, what will be in a couple of years time?</li>
<li>Test-drive what is around now  (now I like the idea of that!)</li>
<li>Come up with the best recommendations</li>
<li>AND share this information with  all of you guys through this website</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" title="electric vehicles" src="http://www.all-electric-vehicles.com/image-files/evan-pedelectric-city-3.jpg" alt="electric vehicles" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="160" height="182" align="left" /><br />
I reckon the journey will be worthwhile, with lots of chances to test-drive some cool wheels &#8211;  <strong>and maybe even get a chance to buy one</strong> (a Tesla would be nice)!</p>
<p>Of course, with electric vehicles, the theory is that they will save loads on fuel and  running costs, as well as lowering environmental impact &#8211; and I suppose they will, <strong>but I aim to have the coolest set of wheels in town!</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" title="electric vehicles" src="http://www.all-electric-vehicles.com/image-files/electric_car_tango.jpg" alt="electric vehicles" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="200" height="175" align="right" /> So, is it possible to find a lively, good-looking, fuel-miserly set of electric wheels at this moment in time?  If not, when? One year from now? Two years? By the time of my pension?</p>
<p><strong><em>Stay with me here &#8211; have a look around &#8211; see what happened next.  And then make your own mind up!</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A hidden premise of mine is that we will have an energy crash in the future and when that happens most electricity will be diverted from the residential market to municipal and national security needs. After that food production and other necessities. Still people have their own electrical generation capacity. Enough to charge batteries so there will be a lot of &#8220;light&#8221; vehicles around. I don&#8217;t think many Volt sized cars will be workable but heh compared to a horse, 40 or 50 miles an hour is not bad.</p>

<h1>Welcome to Electric-Bikes.com</h1>
<h2>Practical transportation for errands and short commutes.</h2>
<p>Electric bikes are part of a wide range of Light Electric Vehicles (LEVs) that provide convenient local transportation.  			Generally designed for one person and small cargo capacity, electric bike range, speed, and cost are moderate.  			For most of us, the majority of our trips are less than 10 miles &#8211; within the range of most e-bikes.  			Clean, quiet, and efficient LEVs offer the advantages of an extra car without the burdens.</p>
<p>To learn more about the range of electric bikes, kits and LEVs, visit our <a href="http://www.electric-bikes.com/intro.html">introduction</a> page. Or, click on your favorite type of vehicle below.</p>

<h1>Top 10 Tips for Renters!</h1>
</div>
<div id="mid_col">
<p>Even if you rent an apartment, townhouse, or a home, you can make a  big difference, too!  These tips will show you how to be more energy  efficient and save energy, money, and reduce the risks of global  warming.  If there are things you can&#8217;t change on your own, share these  tips and encourage your landlord to help you make a change for the  better.</p>
<ol>
<li>Lighting is one of the easiest places to start saving energy.  Replacing your five most frequently used light fixtures or the bulbs in  them with ENERGY STAR qualified lights can save more than $65 a year in  energy costs. ENERGY STAR qualified compact fluorescent light bulbs  (CFLs) provide high-quality light output, use 75% less energy, and last  6–10 times longer than standard incandescent light bulbs, saving money  on energy bills and replacement costs.
<ul>
<li>Remember to always turn off your lights when leaving a room.  Turning off just one 60-watt incandescent bulb that would otherwise burn  eight hours a day can save about $15 per year!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Considering purchasing a room air conditioner? Consider an ENERGY  STAR qualified model. They use at least 10 percent less energy than  standard models.
<ul>
<li>In the winter, be sure to insulate room air conditioners from  the outside with a tight-fitting a/c unit cover, available at your local  home improvement center or hardware store. This keeps heated air from  escaping outside. Alternately, you can remove the window unit in the  winter months to prevent energy losses.</li>
<li>Be sure the window unit fits tightly in the window so outdoor air is not getting in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If possible, install a programmable thermostat to automatically  adjust your home&#8217;s temperature settings when you&#8217;re away or sleeping.
<ul>
<li>When used properly, a programmable thermostat with its four  temperature settings can save up to $150 a year in energy costs. Proper  use means setting the thermostat at energy-saving temperatures without  overriding that setting. You should also set the &#8220;hold&#8221; button at a  constant energy-saving temperature when you&#8217;re away or on vacation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consumer electronics play an increasingly larger role in your  home&#8217;s energy consumption, accounting for 15 percent of household  electricity use. Many consumer electronics products use energy even when  switched off. Electronics equipment that has earned the ENERGY STAR  helps save energy when off, while maintaining features like clock  displays, channel settings, and remote-control functions.
<ul>
<li>Unplug any battery chargers or power adapters when not in use (like your cell phone charger!).</li>
<li>Use a power strip as a central “turn off” point when you are done using equipment.
<ul>
<li>Even when turned off, electronic and IT equipment often use a  small amount of electricity. For home office equipment, this stand-by or  “phantom” power load can range from a few watts to as much as 20 or  even 40 watts for each piece of equipment. Using a power strip for your  computer and all peripheral equipment allows you to completely  disconnect the power supply from the power source, eliminating standby  power consumption.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A ten minute shower can use less water than a full bath.
<ul>
<li>With a new 2.5 gallon-per-minute (low-flow) shower head, a  10-minute shower will use about 25 gallons of water, saving you five  gallons of water over a typical bath. A new showerhead also will save  energy — up to $145 each year on electricity — beating out both the bath  and an old-fashioned showerhead.</li>
<li>To avoid moisture problems, control humidity in your bathroom by  running your ventilating fan during and 15 minutes after showers and  baths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure all air registers are clear of furniture so that air can  circulate freely. If your home has radiators, place heat-resistant  reflectors between radiators and walls. In the winter, this will help  heat the room instead of the wall.</li>
<li>During cold weather, take advantage of the sun&#8217;s warmth by keeping  drapes open during daylight hours. To keep out the heat of the summer  sun, close window shades and drapes in warm weather.</li>
<li>Save water by scraping dishes instead of rinsing them before  loading in the dishwasher. Run your dishwasher with a full load and use  the air-dry option if available.
<ul>
<li>Rinsing dirty dishes before loading your dishwasher uses a lot  of water and energy. Most dishwashers today can thoroughly clean dishes  that have had food scraped, rather than rinsed, off — the wash cycle and  detergent take care of the rest. To make the most efficient use of your  dishwasher&#8217;s energy and water consumption, run the dishwasher only when  enough dirty dishes have accumulated for a full load.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wash your laundry with cold water whenever possible. To save  water, try to wash full loads or, if you must wash a partial load,  reduce the level of water appropriately.
<ul>
<li>Hot water heating accounts for about 90 percent of the energy  your machine uses to wash clothes — only 10 percent goes to electricity  used by the washer motor. Depending on the clothes and local water  quality (hardness), many homeowners can effectively do laundry  exclusively with cold water, using cold water laundry detergents.  Switching to cold water can save the average household more than $40  annually (with an electric water heater) and more than $30 annually  (with a gas water heater).</li>
<li>Washing full loads can save you more than 3,400 gallons of water each year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t over dry your clothes. If your dryer has a moisture sensor  that will automatically turn the machine off when clothes are done, use  it to avoid over drying. Remember to clean the lint trap before every  load. Dry full loads, or reduce drying time for partial loads. Learn  more.
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s easy to over dry your clothes, if one setting is used for  various fabric types. Try to dry loads made up of similar fabrics, so  the entire load dries just as the cycle ends. Many dryers come with  energy-saving moisture or humidity sensors that shut off the heat when  the clothes are dry. If you don&#8217;t have this feature, try to match the  cycle length to the size and weight of the load. A dryer operating an  extra 15 minutes per load can cost you up to $34, every year.</li>
<li>The lint trap is an important energy saver. Dryers work by  moving heated air through wet clothes, evaporating and then venting  water vapor outside. If the dryer cannot provide enough heat, or move  air sufficiently through the clothes, they will take longer to dry, and  may not dry at all. One of the easiest things you can do to increase  drying efficiency is to clean the lint trap before each and every load.  This step also can save you up to $34 each year.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Apartments</h1>
<p>Simple energy conservation measures can lower your utility bills  while increasing the comfort of your apartment. Although your landlord  or management company is ultimately responsible for your building&#8217;s  energy efficiency, you make dozens of energy decisions every day.</p>
<h2>Electricity</h2>
<p>Many ways for cutting electricity costs in houses also apply to apartments. See our section on <a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/electricity/index.cfm/mytopic=11140">reducing electricity use</a> for ways to lower these costs.</p>
<h2>Heating and Cooling</h2>
<p>Here  are some ways to reduce your heating and cooling costs. They can also  make your apartment more comfortable. You might need your landlord&#8217;s or  management company&#8217;s permission for some of the suggestions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/insulation_airsealing/index.cfm/mytopic=11270">Caulk</a> and <a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/insulation_airsealing/index.cfm/mytopic=11280">weatherstrip</a> windows and exterior doors.</li>
<li>Carefully select, install, and use <a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/windows_doors_skylights/index.cfm/mytopic=13500">window treatments or coverings</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Water Heating</h2>
<p>If you have your own water heater in your apartment, see our section on <a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=13030">energy-efficient water heating</a>. If you don&#8217;t have your own water heater, you can still save energy by <a href="http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=13050">reducing your hot water use</a>. You may need your landlord&#8217;s or management company&#8217;s permission for some of these energy conservation measures.</p>

<p><!-- /#credit --><span class="first-letter">A</span>mericans&#8217; infatuation with their cars has endured through booms and busts, but last year something rare happened in the United States: The number of automobiles actually fell.</p>
<p>The size of the U.S. car fleet dropped by a hefty four million vehicles to 246 million, the only large decline since the U.S. Department of Transportation began modern recordkeeping in 1960. Americans bought only 10 million cars – and sent 14 million to the scrapyard.</p>
<p>The decline in sales from previous years came despite 2009&#8217;s cash-for-clunkers program, in which the U.S. government gave Americans up to $4,500 (U.S.) to trade in their gas guzzlers for new, more fuel-efficient cars – a program that saw nearly 700,000 vehicles scrapped.</p>
<p>And the overall drop in car ownership has prompted speculation that the long American love affair with the car is fading. Analysts cite such diverse factors as high gas prices, the expansion of many municipal transit systems, and the popularity of networking websites among teenagers replacing cars as a way of socializing.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve reached a sort of saturation point in this country” when it comes to cars, said Lester Brown, president of the Earth Policy Institute, an environmental think tank based in Washington.</p>
<p>The institute is issuing an analysis Wednesday that contends the drop in 2009 isn&#8217;t a one-time fluke caused by the recession, and that U.S. car ownership is likely to be entering a longer-term decline that will see the fleet drop by another 25 million by 2020.</p>

<h1>Cramped on Land,   Big Oil Bets at Sea</h1>
<h3 class="byline">BY BEN CASSELMAN AND GUY CHAZAN</h3>
<p>Big Oil never wanted to be here, in 4,300 feet of water far out in the Gulf of Mexico, drilling through nearly five miles of rock.</p>
<p>It is an expensive way to look for oil. Chevron Corp. is paying nearly $500,000 a day to the owner of the Clear Leader, one of the world&#8217;s newest and most powerful drilling rigs. The new well off the coast of Louisiana will connect to a huge platform floating nearby, which cost Chevron $650 million to build. The first phase of this oil-exploration project took more than 10 years and cost $2.7 billion &#8212;</p>

<h1>CEOs endorse &#8216;foothold strategy&#8217; for electric cars</h1>
<p><span class="author"> by <a href="http://www.cnet.com/profile/mlamonica/"> Martin LaMon</a></span> A group of CEOs on Monday came out favor of a regional roll-out of electric vehicles in up to eight cities to demonstrate the viability of the technology and incubate the fledgling industry.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.electrificationcoalition.org/">Electricifcation Coalition</a> held a press conference in Washington, D.C. and released an Electrification Roadmap, which prescribes the business and policy steps required to ramp up <a title="Barriers loom on road to plug-in cars -- Friday, Oct 23, 2009" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10381092-54.html">electric vehicle adoption</a>.</p>
<p>There are 13 members of the coalition, including the CEOs of Nissan Motor, FedEx, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, and battery maker A123 Systems. The coalition was spun out of <a href="http://www.secureenergy.org/">Securing America&#8217;s Future Energy</a>, a lobbying group focused on reducing U.S. imports of oil.</p>
<p class="slideshow float-right NEWS_PROMO" style="width: 372px;">

<p>The Electrification Coalition argues that light-duty electric vehicles are the only technology that can cut oil imports and reduce carbon emissions in the near term. Its report (<a href="http://electrificationcoalition.org/535928473533888957466293/EC-Roadmap-print.zip">click for link</a>) focuses on what&#8217;s required to make electric <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/car-tech/">cars</a> available at large scale.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we have the conditions for the mass market. But it&#8217;s going to take more time,&#8221; said Carlos Ghosn, the president and CEO of Nissan. &#8220;The investments to be made are huge. To make 50,000 batteries is a $250 million investment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of all the major automakers, Nissan is the most bullish on electrification. It is releasing an all-electric family sedan called the Leaf in the U.S. and Japan next year. It projects that 10 percent of new cars sales in 2020 will be electric, which is higher than most analysts&#8217; projections.</p>
<p>The shift presents challenges to auto makers that are unsure of <a title="Plug-in electric cars: New technology, familiar feel -- Thursday, Oct 29, 2009" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10384917-54.html">consumer</a> acceptance. <a title="Clusters of plug-in cars will tax local power grids -- Tuesday, Oct 20, 2009" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10378778-54.html">Utilities</a> and municipalities need to prepare in order to make these vehicles more consumer-friendly but they, too, are unsure what the volume of sales will be.</p>
<p>To take some uncertainly out of the picture, the Electrification Coalition advocates a &#8220;<a title="It takes a village to sell an electric car -- Tuesday, Dec 16, 2008" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10122072-54.html">foothold strategy</a>.&#8221; Six to eight cities would create a number of incentives for electric vehicles, such as preferential parking and public charging stations. They would apply for government incentives and then test out the system to help bring electric cars to &#8220;critical mass,&#8221; explained David Crane, the president and CEO of power generator NRG Energy.</p>
<p>In the first phase, the plan calls for getting 50,000 to 100,000 light-duty plug-in vehicles on the road per year in certain areas starting next year and then expand to 25 cities. Its report sets a target of having 25 percent of new vehicle sales be plug-ins by 2020, which is 5 million vehicles. A jump to 90 percent of new vehicle sales being plug-ins by 2030 would represent roughly 17 million units, according to data from consulting company PRTM.</p>
<p>For consumers, batteries should be owned and <a title="Study: To speed electric cars to market, sell batteries separately -- Monday, Jul 13, 2009" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10285338-54.html">financed separately from the car itself</a>, Crane said. Because batteries are an expensive component that makes it more expensive than a comparably-sized gasoline car, auto makers, including Nissan, are looking at ways to keep monthly car payments roughly the same by leasing batteries.</p>

<p>Course, if you want to get around all this hemming and hawing and get going today there is ZAP:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zapworld.com/">http://www.zapworld.com/ </a></p>
<h2 class="title-hm">100% Electric &#8211; Zero Air Pollution (ZAP)</h2>
<p><a rel="shadowbox[];width=480;height=295;" href="http://www.zapworld.com/files/Video/Zap-Alias-Electric-Car.flv"><img decoding="async" style="margin: 0pt 30px 0pt 5px; float: right;" src="http://www.zapworld.com/themes/ability/images/01-09-aliasvideo2.jpg" alt="" /></a>ZAP is a leading distributor of affordable, efficient, 100% electric vehicles in the United States and has established a network of licensed automobile dealers throughout the United States. Plans for European distribution are underway as well. In January 2009, ZAP unveiled a high performance electric roadster called the Alias which is planned for deliveries in late 2010. ZAP launched the XEBRA in 2006. Our first automotive product comes in a four-passenger sedan version and a two-passenger utility pickup truck.. Almost all EVs sold are LSVs. With speed restricted to 25 MPH. Xebra Zapcars and Zaptrucks are licensed to go up to 40 MPH to fill the growing demand for electric vehicles in use for urban, in-town driving. Other vehicles sold by ZAP include the XL truck, the Zapvan Shuttle, and ATV called Dude and the always popular Zappy3 scooter line.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are 2 reasons for a product to run its course in a capitalist society. 1. the resource runs out like carrier pigeons in the wild or  whale oil, 2.  they become unfashionable or unsaleable. You could think of this as Peak Raccoon Skin or Peak Hats. If people quit buying the stuff, the manufacturers have to quit making it. Many times the manufacturers don&#8217;t even admit that their way of  life has ended they simply vanish&#8230;Can anyone say Pet Rock? The immediate effect of the recent Cash For Clunkers program was to immediately and permanently decrease the demand for gasoline in the US.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2009/10/06/peak-gasoline-is-here.aspx">http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2009/10/06/peak-gasoline-is-here.aspx</a></p>
<h1>Peak Gasoline Is Here</h1>
<p><span class="vcard byline">By 				Toby Shute 				</span><br />
<span class="dateline">October 6, 2009</span>The jury&#8217;s still out on <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/international/2009/04/03/is-it-time-to-buy-oil.aspx">peak oil</a>, but the concept of peak <em>gasoline</em> has some very credible proponents.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, <strong>ExxonMobil</strong>   <span class="ticker">(NYSE: <a href="http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/XOM.aspx" class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001">XOM</a>)</span> CEO Rex Tillerson argued that U.S. gasoline consumption peaked in 2007. In his words, &#8220;motor vehicle gasoline demand is down, is headed down, and is going to continue to head down.&#8221;</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a new position for the prominent oil patch poobah. Back in April, <em>The</em> <em>Wall Street Journal</em> cited Exxon&#8217;s belief that U.S. light duty gasoline demand will drop by 22% by 2030.</p>
<p>Tillerson isn&#8217;t alone in the peak-gasoline camp, either. The government&#8217;s own estimates indicate that gasoline consumption peaked in 2007, at 371.2 million gallons per day. Cambridge Energy Research Associates has concluded that 2007 was probably the peak, barring a collapse in the oil price.</p>
<p>The main drivers (ahem) of this trend are the dovetailing desires for reduced oil dependence, lower emissions, and better fuel efficiency. The high oil prices of 2008 &#8212; and even today&#8217;s prices, which are quite high by historical standards &#8212; have been a major force to shift consumer preferences toward more compact and efficient vehicles, including hybrids. Lithium-ion battery whiz <strong>A123</strong>   <span class="ticker">(Nasdaq: <a href="http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/AONE.aspx" class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001">AONE</a>)</span> certainly has high oil prices &#8212; and <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2009/09/22/should-you-get-charged-up-about-this-ipo.aspx">government greenbacks</a> &#8212; to thank for its recent <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/high-growth/2009/09/25/a-barnburner-of-a-battery-ipo.aspx">warm reception</a> on Wall Street.</p>
<p>A parallel development is the army of venture capital-backed science projects seeking all manner of petroleum alternatives to <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2009/10/02/stick-that-in-your-fuel-tank-and-burn-it.aspx">stick in your fuel tank</a>. Renewable fuel standards &#8212; optimistic, given current funding levels &#8211;hold out the promise of a robust end market for these products.</p>

<h1 class="headline">Sunoco idling Eagle Point plant, furloughing 400 workers</h1>
<h3>Philadelphia Business Journal &#8211; by <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/search/results.html?Ntt=%22Peter%20Key%22&amp;Ntk=All&amp;Ntx=mode%20matchallpartial" id="byline">Peter Key</a> Staff Writer</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/gen/Sunoco_Inc._562A748E6A0544B499001B5A0219AA8C.html" class="story_clink"><strong>Sunoco Inc.</strong></a> said Tuesday it is indefinitely idling its Eagle Point refinery in Westville, N.J., and furloughing all 400 workers there.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia-based oil refiner and gasoline retailer also said it is halving its quarterly dividend to 15 cents from 30 cents, starting with the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>Sunoco (NYSE:SUN) said it decided to idle Eagle Point in response to the margin pressure faced by refiners from the sagging economy, weak demand and increased global refining capacity.</p>
<p>The company said it will shift production from Eagle Point to its refineries in Philadelphia and Marcus Hook, Pa. It said it will be able to produce the same amount of refined products at those two refineries that it had been producing at them plus Eagle Point and still meet demand.</p>
<p>Sunoco said it will keep Eagle Point idle until market conditions improve and will consider other options for the refinery, including using it to produce alternative fuels.</p>
<p>The company said it will continue to pay its contribution to medical benefits for the Eagle Point employees for the duration of their furlough. It also will offer them a voluntary severance program that includes job-placement assistance and retraining.</p>
<p>Sunoco said it expects to incur pre-tax charges of $475 million to $500 million, most of which will be noncash, from idling Eagle Point. It will record most in the recently ended quarter and the rest in the current quarter.</p>

<p>It must be tough to become obsolete.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Poker Run for Motor Scooters that CES started for Earth Day in the Spring continued in the Fall. The Weather was bad, the Ridership was low but we still had a good time. The food at Mike Carter&#8217;s was really really good. Thanks to the SCOOTER GUYS! Websites first:</p>

<p>:}</p>
<p>Then the Poker Scoot:</p>
<p>We started at GrabAJava like always</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/pokerscoot5.jpg" title="pokerscoot5.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/pokerscoot5.jpg" alt="pokerscoot5.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Moved on to Overturfs</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/pokerscoot8.jpg" title="pokerscoot8.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/pokerscoot8.thumbnail.jpg" alt="pokerscoot8.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Stopped at the really nice people at Farm and Home</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/pokerscoot4.jpg" title="pokerscoot4.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/pokerscoot4.jpg" alt="pokerscoot4.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Then they went for a big ride to Cantral, Salsbury and back to JiffiStop</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/pokerscoot6.jpg" title="pokerscoot6.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/pokerscoot6.jpg" alt="pokerscoot6.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>We skipped over to the Corner Pub and Grill</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/pokerscoot9.jpg" title="pokerscoot9.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/pokerscoot9.jpg" alt="pokerscoot9.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The Scoot ended at the great guys, The Scooter Guys, and great cooks at Carter&#8217;s Westside</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/pokerscoot3.jpg" title="pokerscoot3.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/pokerscoot3.jpg" alt="pokerscoot3.jpg" /></a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/pokerscoot11.jpg" title="pokerscoot11.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/pokerscoot11.jpg" alt="pokerscoot11.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Everyone WON because we had 4 brave riders (and we saved some loot for next Spring)</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/winner2.jpg" title="winner2.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/winner2.jpg" alt="winner2.jpg" /></a> <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/winner1.jpg" title="winner1.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/winner1.jpg" alt="winner1.jpg" /></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/winner3.jpg" title="winner3.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/winner3.jpg" alt="winner3.jpg" /></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/winner4.jpg" title="winner4.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/winner4.jpg" alt="winner4.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Next year we will have a sign up sheet with a minimum number of riders and a backup date.</p>
