Not the Provencial Government and not the local for surel. This is what we call in the United States call, a National Sacrifice zone. Remove the people and keep on going.

<p>From the air it looks like a huge lake, fed by many tributaries, but on the ground it turns out to be a murky expanse of water, in which no fish or algae can survive. The shore is coated with a black crust, so thick you can walk on it. Into this huge, 10 sq km tailings pond nearby factories discharge water loaded with chemicals used to process the 17 most sought after minerals in the world, collectively known as <a class="u-underline" title="" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/27/rare-minerals-global-renewables-industry" data-link-name="in body link">rare earths</a>.</p>
<p>The town of <a class="u-underline" title="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baotou" data-link-name="in body link">Baotou</a>, in Inner Mongolia, is the largest Chinese source of these strategic elements, essential to advanced technology, from smartphones to GPS receivers, but also to wind farms and, above all, electric cars. The minerals are mined at Bayan Obo, 120km farther north, then brought to Baotou for processing.</p>
<p>The concentration of rare earths in the ore is very low, so they must be separated and purified, using hydro-metallurgical techniques and acid baths. <a class="u-underline" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">China</a> accounts for 97% of global output of these precious substances, with two-thirds produced in Baotou.</p>
<p>The foul waters of the tailings pond contain all sorts of toxic chemicals, but also radioactive elements such as thorium which, if ingested, cause cancers of the pancreas and lungs, and leukaemia. “Before the factories were built, there were just fields here as far as the eye can see. In the place of this radioactive sludge, there were watermelons, aubergines and tomatoes,” says Li Guirong with a sigh.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seriously, how long can it be before HUMANs realize that by killing the world in general they are killing themselves. Squeezing animals out of their habitats squeezes their viruses out into us. We have no immune defenses against them and we die. I mean it is Earth&#8217;s ultimate defense system. I have a hunch we are not gonna be around for long. Wonder which one will get us first, Global Warming or Rejection by the Earth.</p>

<p>In 2013, an 18-month-old boy got sick after playing near a hollow tree in his backyard in a remote West African village. He developed a fever and started vomiting. His stool turned black. Two days later, he died.</p>
<p>Two years and more than 11,000 deaths later, the World Health Organization put out a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/01/15/377517132/14-takeaways-from-the-14-part-who-report-on-ebola">report</a> saying the Ebola outbreak that likely emanated from that hollow tree may have been caused in part by deforestation led by &#8220;foreign mining and timber operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tree the boy played near was infested with insectivorous bats — bats that may have been pushed into the boy&#8217;s village because upward of 80% of their natural habitat had been destroyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you disturb a forest, it actually upsets, if you want, the balance of nature, the balance between pathogens and people,&#8221; says John E. Fa, a professor of biodiversity and human development at Manchester Metropolitan University, who was part of a team of researchers that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14727-9">linked recent forest loss to 25 Ebola outbreaks</a> that have occurred since 1976.</p>
<p>A finding, he says, that showed a strong correlation between recent deforestation and disease outbreaks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is kinda funny because my blog is an accumulator blog and these guys are the maximum accumulators. Having lived in New Orleans for 12 years you can smell it, you can taste and there are days when you just should stay inside. Then there is the urban detritus, it rained 110 inches one year and the flooding was horrid. Walking through the water everyday I faced motor oil, gasoline and even used syringes.</p>

The 2 most consistently true ones are that there are too many people on this planet and the other is that we will pay a price for befouling our planet. This has led some to talk about the possibility of a human &#8220;die back&#8221;. Is this what the beginning of one might look like?</p>

<h1><a title="Is This a Pandemic Being Born?" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/01/is_this_a_pandemic_being_born_china_pigs_virus">Is This a Pandemic Being Born?</a></h1>
<h2>China&#8217;s mysterious pig, duck, and people deaths could be connected. And that should worry us.</h2>
</div>
<h3>BY LAURIE GARRETT | APRIL 1, 2013</h3>
</div>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it would happen. Children playing along an urban river bank would spot hundreds of grotesque, bloated pig carcasses bobbing downstream. Hundreds of miles away, angry citizens would protest the rising stench from piles of dead ducks and swans, their rotting bodies collecting by the thousands along river banks. And three unrelated individuals would stagger into three different hospitals, gasping for air. Two would quickly die of severe pneumonia and the third would lay in critical condition in an intensive care unit for many days. Government officials would announce that a previously unknown virus had sickened three people, at least, and killed two of them. And while the world was left to wonder how the pigs, ducks, swans, and people might be connected, the World Health Organization would release deliberately terse statements, offering little insight.</p>
<p>It reads like a movie plot &#8212; I should know, as I was a consultant for Steven Soderbergh&#8217;s <em>Contagion</em>. But the facts delineated are all true, and have transpired over the last six weeks in China. The events could, indeed, be unrelated, and the new virus, a form of influenza denoted as H7N9, may have already run its course, infecting just three people and killing two.</p>
<p>Or this could be how pandemics begin.</p>
<p>On March 10, residents of China&#8217;s powerhouse metropolis, Shanghai, noticed some dead pigs floating among garbage flotsam in the city&#8217;s Huangpu River. The vile carcasses appeared in Shanghai&#8217;s most important tributary of the mighty Yangtze, a 71-mile river that is edged by the Bund, the city&#8217;s main tourist area, and serves as the primary source of drinking water and ferry travel for the 23 million residents of the metropolis and its millions of visitors. The vision of a few dead pigs on the surface of the Huangpu was every bit as jarring for local Chinese as porcine carcasses would be for French strolling the Seine, Londoners along the Thames, or New Yorkers looking from the Brooklyn Bridge down on the East River.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pro  Nuke people always ignore the long chain that leads up to the first Nuclear reaction, including mining the dangerous ore and the tremendous construction costs. This chain may negate at least several years of their contention that Nuclear Power is &#8220;carbon free&#8221;. They also never discuss the after chain. Which includes both the disposal of the waste from the reactor but eventually the cost of decommissioning the reactors themselves. I think that Yucca Mountain was a perfect response to that, but I am alone on that one. This piece also mentions the distructive economic system that these reactors would perpetuate, which is disgusting. BUT the larger picture is that nuclear reactors are totally unnecessary. I have included here only the Monthly Review&#8217;s preface.</p>

<p><a title="On Nuclear Power" href="http://monthlyreview.org/2011/02/01/on-nuclear-power" rel="bookmark">On Nuclear Power</a></p>
<p>Response to John W. Farley’s ‘Our Last Chance to Save Humanity’</p>
<p><a title="Posts by Southern California Federation of Scientists" href="http://monthlyreview.org/author/scfssoutherncaliforniafederationofscientists" rel="author">Southern California Federation of Scientists</a> and <a title="Posts by John W. Farley" href="http://monthlyreview.org/author/johnwfarley" rel="author">John W. Farley</a></p>
<p><em>Monthly Review</em> has long been on record as opposed to the expansion of nuclear energy.<a id="fn1" href="http://monthlyreview.org/2011/02/01/on-nuclear-power#en1">1</a> Most recently, some of the dangers of nuclear power, both in its present form and with continuing new technological developments, were spelled out by Robert D. Furber, James C. Warf, and Sheldon C. Plotkin of the Southern California Federation of Scientists, in their article on “<a href="http://monthlyreview.org/2008/02/01/the-future-of-nuclear-power">The Future of Nuclear Power</a>” (<em>MR</em>, February 2008).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we recognize that many scientists, including climatologist James Hansen and our friend, physicist John W. Farley, now see a place for nuclear energy as a kind of last resort, given the dire planetary threat raised by the burning of fossil fuels—made even more dire by the current shift toward even dirtier, more carbon-emitting fossil fuels, such as lower grades of coal, oil from tar sands, and shale oil. If nuclear power presents great dangers to the human population and the earth, it also cannot be denied that the continuation of “business as usual” with respect to carbon emissions will lead to eventual social, economic, and ecological collapse, threatening civilization and most species, including our own. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that some are looking at nuclear energy as a lesser, or more remote, evil. Moreover, the prospect, though still at the theoretical/experimental stage, of revolutionary developments in nuclear power technology, namely Generation IV plants, which could greatly increase the efficiency of nuclear fuel use, reducing the nuclear waste generated, is also changing the nature of the controversy for some.</p>
<p>Yet, in our view, none of this alters the essential nature of the problem: the crossing of planetary boundaries by an economic system that, as long as it exists, must continually produce more and more goods, and thus degrade the environment. In this context, a turn to nuclear energy as a solution is both myopic and a Faustian bargain. The development of alternative energy sources coupled with conservation, in the context of radical transformations in social relations, constitutes the only real, long-term solution.</p>

<h1>Muzzling an Anti-Nuke Trial Defense</h1>
<div>
<div>November 21, 2012</div>
</div>
<p>By John LaForge</p>
<p>Three disarmament radicals who snuck into the Y-12 nuclear weapons complex last summer are preparing for their February 2013 trial, and face the prospect that any mention of nuclear weapons will be forbidden.</p>
<p>Y-12 is the 811-acre site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, that’s been building H-bombs and contaminating workers and the environment since 1943. On July 28, Sister Megan Rice, Michael Walli and Greg Boertje-Obed snipped through fences and walked up to the new Highly Enriched Uranium Materials Facility building. They unfurled banners, spray-painted the building with phrases such as “Woe to the empire of blood,” poured blood, prayed and broke bread.</p>
<p>Now they face felony charges that carry a maximum of $500,000 in fines and 15 years in prison. Additionally, in what looks like an attempt to scare them into pleading guilty now, federal prosecutors have mentioned bringing two heavier charges, including sabotage “during wartime,” which together carry up to 50 years imprisonmen</p>

<p title="photo (13)">To solve the world’s energy problems and combat a rise in global warming, the solutions need to be dramatic and powerful. And definitely not cute. That’s the blunt assessment of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who dismissed smaller scale technologies like residential solar installations as being “cute” but ineffective.</p>
<p>Speaking at the <a href="http://www.wiredbusinessconference.com/">Wired Business Conference in New York</a>, Gates<a href="http://gigaom.com/cleantech/bill-gates-ted-we-need-an-energy-miracle/"> sounded a now familiar call for innovation in clean energy production</a>. But he said the challenge of meeting the world’s growing energy needs while reducing the rise of carbon emissions won’t be handled by smaller deployments of technology. For example, he said solar panels attached to homes and connected to smart grids is no match for the real impact of large remote solar installations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why do I say that. Because the Sun is finally into its warming phase. The Sun always has 4 cycles: cooling, quietude, warming and maximus. These cycles inhabit an 11 year cycle most probably related to the creation of some of the heavier elements in its core. What does change in no known sequence is which is bigger the cooling cycle or the warming cycle and I suppose some brief time periods of equilibrium. For the last 30 years (almost 3 full cycles) the cooling side of the cycle has been bigger than the heating cycle and the last quietude was almost 2 full years which I believe is the biggest in recorded history. Here is the point. The planet should be cooling but it isn&#8217;t. During the cooling we still had some pretty hot years. Why. There is no other thing to blame, but humans. Now that the Sun is heating up and for the next 3 years or so, Watch Out!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/drought-affects-nation-s-energy-prices">http://www.examiner.com/article/drought-affects-nation-s-energy-prices</a></p>
<p>If you think the <a href="http://www.examiner.com/topic/drought">drought</a> of summer 2012 is only increasing the prices of the nation&#8217;s corn and grain supplies, you&#8217;re missing a large part of the picture. Drought reaches into every corner of American pockets, affecting even the cost of driving a car and what we pay for air conditioning.</p>
<p><em><strong>Current drought conditions</strong></em></p>
<p>The United States is experiencing the most severe drought, with the highest percentage of land affected by it, in over 60 years, according to the <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2012-07-16/us/us_us-drought_1_national-drought-mitigation-center-epic-drought-short-term-drought" rel="nofollow">National Climatic Data Center</a>&#8216;s July 17 report. (See August 5 <em>Palmer drought severity map</em> at left. Yellow = moderately dry, orange = severely dry, red = excessively dry.)</p>
<p>Parched conditions have now led to <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79303.html?hp=l5_b1" rel="nofollow">disaster declarations</a> in more than half the counties in the nation&#8211;1,584, in 32 states&#8211;this growing season. The declarations make these areas eligible for government aid, including low-interest emergency loans to hold the line until farms and ranches recover.</p>
<p>And the ripple effects of this brutal weather will extend farther than the farms in the Midwest, where corn and soybean crops are failing. It will affect meat production nationwide as well because pasture and grazing land has been blighted, forcing farmers and ranchers to seek other&#8211;and more expensive&#8211;feed for cows and other animals.</p>
<blockquote><p>In some areas, cattle have to be fed with next year&#8217;s grain reserves because local pasture lands have dried up. Almost four million acres of <a href="http://www.agrinews-pubs.com/articles/news/latest-news/default.asp?article=8A7427A0372184C3AEA33557CB10F29E0D32DBFBE9E0009B" rel="nofollow">federal conservation</a> land has been opened for haying and grazing. Crop insurers have also begun to provide <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/02/us-drought-2012-disaster-areas_n_1731393.html" rel="nofollow">penalty-free 30-day grace periods</a> on 2012 premiums.</p></blockquote>

<p>If the pictures of those towering wildfires in  Colorado haven&#8217;t convinced you, or the size of your AC bill this summer,  here are some hard numbers about climate change: June broke or tied  3,215 high-temperature records across the United States. That followed  the warmest May on record for the Northern Hemisphere – the 327th  consecutive month in which the temperature of the entire globe exceeded  the 20th-century average, the odds of which  occurring by simple chance  were 3.7 x 10-99, a number considerably larger than the number of stars  in the universe.</p>
<p>Meteorologists reported that this spring was the warmest ever  recorded for our nation – in fact, it crushed the old record by so much  that it represented the &#8220;largest temperature departure from average of  any season on record.&#8221; The same week, Saudi authorities reported that it  had rained in Mecca despite a temperature of 109 degrees, the hottest  downpour in the planet&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>Not that our leaders seemed to notice. Last month the world&#8217;s  nations, meeting in Rio for the 20th-anniversary reprise of a massive  1992 environmental summit, accomplished nothing. Unlike George H.W.  Bush, who flew in for the first conclave, Barack Obama didn&#8217;t even  attend. It was &#8220;a ghost of the glad, confident meeting 20 years ago,&#8221;  the British journalist George Monbiot wrote; no one paid it much  attention, footsteps echoing through the halls &#8220;once thronged by  multitudes.&#8221; Since I wrote one of the first books for a general audience  about global warming way back in 1989, and since I&#8217;ve spent the  intervening decades working ineffectively to slow that warming, I can  say with some confidence that we&#8217;re losing the fight, badly and quickly –  losing it because, most of all, we remain in denial about the peril  that human civilization is in.</p>
