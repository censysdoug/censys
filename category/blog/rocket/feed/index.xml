										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a short article, but when you consider his company launched Heavy Falcon this week as well, it has been a very good year for Elon. It is just getting started.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/73140-tesla-massive-100mw-south-australian-battery-putting-big.html">https://www.techspot.com/news/73140-tesla-massive-100mw-south-australian-battery-putting-big.html</a></p>
<h1 class="large">Tesla&#8217;s massive 100MW South Australian battery is putting a big dent in &#8216;gas cartel&#8217; profits</h1>
<h2>Tesla&#8217;s battery is significantly undercutting traditional &#8216;gas cartel&#8217; energy charges</h2>
<p><em> By <a href="https://www.techspot.com/community/staff/polycount.403116/" rel="author">Cohen Coberly</a> <time datetime="2018-02-06 16:02:00-0500"> <span title="2018-02-06 16:02:00">on Feb 6, 2018, 4:02 PM</span> </time></em></p>
<p>Back in March, Tesla boss Elon Musk promised to provide South Australia with a 100MW battery to help the state make the switch to more affordable, renewable energy. At the time, he promised to get the project done in under 100 days or give it to them for free &#8211; more than living up to his promise, Tesla <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/72125-south-australia-switches-tesla-100mw-battery-largest-lithium.html">finished the battery installation</a> in only 63 days.</p>
<p>After officially being switched on in December, the battery has gone on to save South Australia millions of dollars. It&#8217;s accomplished this by easing some of the burden associated with high FCAS costs.</p>
<p>For the unaware, FCAS (frequency control and ancillary services) charges are costs the Australian Energy Market Operator must pay when they ask energy companies to contribute some of their network services to the government in the case of scheduled maintenance or energy system faults.</p>

<p>Go there and read. I did say it was a short article. More next week.</p>
