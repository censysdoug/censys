										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been at a loss for words for the last month. Things are going so well. I know Dotard is still President and many things are seriously messed up. But on the alternative energy front things just keep getting better and better. Don Blankenship actually made a fool out of himself and lost a primary vote for the Senate in West Virginia. Next week I may even get to report that Yucca Mountain is open for business. But for now, California hits one out of the park.</p>

<p data-page="1">California regulators on Wednesday mandated that all newly built single family houses have solar panels, part of the state&#8217;s aggressive push to combat climate change.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card collection-item" data-type="text">
<div class=" card-content ">
<p>The California Energy Commission voted 5-0 to approve the measure, which also applies to multifamily buildings of three stories or fewer. The mandate is set to take effect in 2020 and does not need the approval of the Legislature.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card collection-item" data-type="text">
<div class=" card-content ">
<p>The requirement is expected to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-solar-panels-homes-20180508-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">save consumers</a> money in the long run through reduced utility bills, but also make a new house more expensive to purchase at a time many families already struggle to afford a mortgage.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card collection-item" data-type="text">
<div class=" card-content ">
<p>In addition to the solar mandate, the commission approved new insulation and air filter requirements for newly built homes. In all, the new residential requirements are expected to make a single-family house $9,500 more expensive to build on average, but save $19,000 in reduced utility bills over a 30-year period, according to the Energy Commission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I agreed to publish this here because it is such a different perspective then the one I have or CES has. We tend to blame builders for not just serving up top notch energy efficient residences. Then there is the issue of retrofitting. As always this is no endorsement of Ryan or his Real Estate firm. Believe me I have no intention of buying a home in Alaska.</p>

Sellers will also start making changes to the homes they are putting on the market, in order to entice buyers to come see their home instead of a different one. That&#8217;s an important consideration, too, sin<span class="pg-2fc2 pg-2sc0">c</span><span class="pg-2fc2 pg-2sc0">e</span> <span class="pg-2fc1">sellers may need to retrofit their homes</span> in some ways and add options that they would not have chosen to put in if they were remaining in the house. Some green living changes can be expensive, but these changes don&#8217;t always have to be costly. There are lower priced options, as well.</div>

<div class="t pg-2m0 pg-2x2 pg-2h3 pg-2yb pg-2ff1 pg-2fs0 pg-2fc0 pg-2sc0 pg-2ls0 pg-2ws0"><strong>Trends are Moving in the Right Direction, at Least</strong></div>

<div> /</div>
<div class="t pg-2m0 pg-2x2 pg-2h3 pg-2yb pg-2ff1 pg-2fs0 pg-2fc0 pg-2sc0 pg-2ls0 pg-2ws0">Even though there are still far too few green homes, and even though buyers aren&#8217;t making their voices heard as loudly as they could, the trend of green living is still going in the right direction. More buyers see the value of it, and more builders and sellers are starting to make changes in that direction. There is still a long way to go before energy efficiency and reducing waste becomes the standard for new homes and improved existing homes, but a larger pool of buyers demanding these features can help move the needle bit by bit.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To Not talk about how disastrous Trump&#8217;s Presidency will be for the environment and the energy industry I decided to return to my roots in the residential market. Todays article is a bit old but its message is timeless. We have been concentrating on single devices like furnaces, refrigerators, windows seen as a whole instead of a holistic approach to a house.</p>

<h1 class="article-page-heading">We’re Doing Residential Energy Efficiency All Wrong</h1>
<div class="img-desc hidden-xs">
<p>Nate Adams says radical changes are needed in the home-performance business.</p>
<div class="meta"><span class="by-info">by Nate Adams<br />

</div>
<p>Utilities are now spending nearly <a href="http://sheltongrp.com/7-billion-later/">$7 billion a year</a> on energy-efficiency programs. It seems we have little to show for it aside from expensive consultants who will model any results you would like.</p>
<p>These programs tend to focus their marketing on the energy savings or money savings from the projects. Consumers don’t care. If they did, we would see geometric growth instead of a resounding &#8220;meh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others focus on better financing products, slicker sales pitches, faster energy audits, higher rebates or any of a myriad of other things.</p>
<p>In the residential sector, none of these are the problem. The lack of sales is the problem.</p>
<p>Projects are not being sold and implemented in substantial numbers. We need to slow it down, build relationships with consumers and educate them, learn and think systemically about the problems they have, and arrive at solutions that fit homeowner budgets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am really shocked by this article. The idea that residential energy consumption could change so dramatically  in only 16 years is so amazing. Its like when we shifted to coal or later when we shifted to natural gas and then electricity. Only nobody is really talking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=10271">http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=10271</a></p>
<p><span class="date">March 7, 2013</span></p>
<h1><a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=10271#">Heating and cooling no longer majority of U.S. home energy use</a></h1>
<p>For decades, space heating and cooling (space conditioning) accounted for more than half of all residential energy consumption. Estimates from the most recent <a href="http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2009/index.cfm?view=consumption">Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS)</a>, collected in 2010 and 2011 and released in 2011 and 2012, show that 48% of energy consumption in U.S. homes in 2009 was for heating and cooling, down from 58% in 1993. Factors underpinning this trend are increased adoption of more efficient equipment, better insulation, more efficient windows, and population shifts to warmer climates. The shift in how energy is consumed in homes has occurred even as per-household energy consumption has <a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=6570">steadily declined</a>.</p>
<p>While energy used for space conditioning has declined, energy consumption for appliances and electronics continues to rise. Although some appliances that are subject to federal efficiency standards, such as refrigerators and clothes washers, have become more efficient, the increased number of devices that consume energy in homes has offset these efficiency gains. Non-weather related energy use for appliances, electronics, water heating, and lighting now accounts for 52% of total consumption, up from 42% in 1993. The majority of devices in the fastest growing category of residential end-uses are powered by electricity, <a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=10251">increasing the total amount of primary energy needed to meet residential electricity demand</a>. As described in yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=10251">Today in Energy</a>, increased electricity use has a disproportionate effect on the amount of total primary energy required to support site-level energy use.</p>
<p>Other notable trends in household energy consumption include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average U.S. household consumed 11,320 kilowatthours (kWh) of electricity in 2009, of which the largest portion (7,526 kWh) was for appliances, electronics, lighting, and miscellaneous uses.</li>
<li>On average, residents living in homes constructed in the 1980s consumed 77 million Btu of total energy at home. By comparison, those living in newer homes, built from 2000 to 2009, consumed 92 million Btu per household, which is 19% more.</li>
<li>Space heating accounted for 63% of natural gas consumed in U.S. homes in 2009; the remaining 37% was for water heating, cooking, and miscellaneous uses.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I mean really if they are going to drop their insistence on solar panel installations as part of a retrofit then why keep the name? Are they now a software company or are they now a software and then install whatever company? Good questions with no answers. It would be like Tide if it were to stop making soap and started making dishwashers. Would they keep the name and why?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/a-peak-at-solarcitys-new-energy-efficiency-software?">http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/a-peak-at-solarcitys-new-energy-efficiency-software?</a></p>
<h1>Has SolarCity Created the Amazon 1-Click for Energy Efficiency?</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We believe SolarCity has the best database of residential energy use of anyone in the world.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Stephen Lacey: June 28, 2013</h6>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After SolarCity shifted its energy efficiency strategy and pulled back from doing residential retrofits in-house, the solar services behemoth is moving straight into <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/intelligent-efficiency-innovations-reshaping-the-energy-efficiency-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intelligent efficiency</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GTM&#8217;s Eric Wesoff recently reported on SolarCity&#8217;s <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/SolarCity-Shifts-Its-Home-Efficiency-Strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolving</a> business plan and the <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Can-SolarCity-Scale-Energy-Efficiency-Services-Like-Solar-Roofs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resulting changes</a> that company executives say will scale residential efficiency in the same way solar services have <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/us-residential-solar-financing-to-reach-5.7-billion-by-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scaled residential solar</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But solar is very different from efficiency. For the most part, solar is very standardized and installations are uniform from home to home. Efficiency retrofits encompass an extraordinarily broad category of activities and skills. Incentives are also quite different for efficiency, making it more complicated from a financial perspective. That&#8217;s why <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/are-solar-companies-equipped-to-get-into-energy-efficiency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only a handful</a> of U.S. solar contractors have offered efficiency as an in-house service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SolarCity decided that doing the retrofit work itself was not the best way to scale. Instead, it has turned from manpower to the power of big data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The secret sauce is a &#8220;simulation engine&#8221; that shows homeowners exactly how much they&#8217;re spending on energy everywhere in their house. The initial database was created using information from 16,000 home energy audits performed over the last five years. It relies on an algorithm developed at the Department of Energy that crunches 100 million calculations per home for each individual energy efficiency audit (which is still performed by SolarCity when installing solar).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The simulation software looks at every component in a home in relation to one another,&#8221; said SolarCity COO Peter Rive. &#8220;Every ten minutes, it thinks about what one thing is doing and about its effect on the rest of the systems within the home.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes I know there are many things that are wrong about Las Vegas. People shouldn&#8217;t even be there in the first place. The rape of the river that no longer reaches the sea. The rape of the pristine desert and the death of many Native Americans. I lived there for a year and there is also the cheesy nature of the culture. But when they do something right, you got to give them credit.</p>

<h1>Nevada Energy Star Partners Demonstrate Peak Performance (Web Only)</h1>
<div>BY <a href="http://www.homeenergy.org/list/author/id/946">ANNETTE BUBAK</a></div>
<div>September 01, 2012</div>
<p>Las Vegas may appear balmy and inviting with its sparkling pools and  swaying palm trees, but those who live in Neon City know the truth: It’s  too cold in the winter and too hot in the summer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, hundreds of thousands of homes that were built during  an amazing 50 years of rapid growth in the Southwest do not incorporate  modern advances in energy performance to accommodate the wild swings of  desert climate. As temperatures climb to 110°F in the summer, many homes  leak large amounts of cooled air through gaps in ducts, roofs, windows,  and doors. And when the frigid north wind drops the temperature below  freezing in the winter, heated air escapes, leaving living rooms and  bedrooms uncomfortably cold and drafty. While Las Vegans know their  climate, they may not realize that they are paying to heat and cool the  great outdoors.</p>
<p>The dramatic temperature shifts in the high-desert climate make Las  Vegas an ideal place for homeowners who are looking to make their homes  more comfortable and to save substantially on their energy bills. Funded  in part by DOE’s Building America program, the Building America  Retrofit Alliance is working with the Nevada ENERGY STAR Partners–Green  Alliance (NESP–Green Alliance), and with Better Building Performance, a  Las Vegas company, to upgrade two typical homes top to bottom. Their  goal has been to show homeowners and remodelers how easy and effective  energy performance upgrades can be.</p>

<p>Five Models of Energy Efficiency: A Guide to Beautiful, Energy-Efficient Homes</p>
<p>Five US builders are being honored for their exceptional achievements in high performance building at the second annual BASF <a href="http://www.hgtvpro.com/hpro/green_building/article/0,3142,HPRO_27916_5942677,00.html">Builders Challenge</a> Awards.</p>
<p>Led by the U.S Department of Energy (DOE), the Builders  Challenge is working with homebuilders across America to build a new  generation of high-performance homes, working toward the ultimate goal  of providing cost-effective, net-zero energy homes by 2030  for all  Americans.</p>
<p>To qualify for the Builders Challenge, homes must meet at least a 70 on the <a href="http://www.hgtvpro.com/hpro/green_building/article/0,3142,HPRO_27916_5946464,00.html">EnergySmart Home Scale (E-Scale)</a> &#8212; which means they must use at least 30 percent less energy than a typical new home built to code.</p>

<div>Posted on April 18, 2011 by David Apperson</div>
<p>The UAF campus uses electricity.  Some of the electricity is used to  power fluorescent light bulbs which are much more efficient than  incandescent bulbs but because they exist as a load in the power grid,  use energy.  How much energy is being used by these lights, is it more  than is necessary, and how bright to classrooms and computer labs need  to be?  In 2010, UAF created its Office of Sustainability to utilize the  $20 per student fee towards sustainable projects.  The goal is to  supply the necessary funds to make sustainable projects happen but the  projects must be cost effective with realistic financial return  periods.  Although bright rooms  are convenient, the UAF sustainability club should lobby the Chancellor  and Facilities Services to implement a program that systematically  removes bulbs from over-lit rooms because it will reduce the energy use  of the UAF campus, make indoor conditions more comfortable, and save  money.</p>
<p>The simplest way to reduce the energy use for lighting is to remove  unnecessary bulbs.  Before someone begins pulling random lights from  their fixtures at will, some simple calculations can be done to get  “back of the envelope” numbers for a cost-benefit analysis.  The  following calculations will use some simple energy units, the kilo-Watt  (kW) and the kilo-Watt-hour (kWh).  A kW is a measurement of Power and  is defined as 1,000 joules per second, how quickly work is being done.  A  kWh is a measurement of energy, a fairly large amount of energy at  that, being the amount of work by a one kW source for one hour.   Electricity is sold in kWh, because it doesn’t matter how fast someone  or something is using the electricity but how much of it they are  using.  Light intensity can be measured in lumens or foot-candles.  A  lumen is a measure of the power of light perceived by the human eye and  the foot-candle can be considered as the amount of light falling on a  surface, being defined as one lumen per square foot.</p>
<p>The first thing to be determined is whether or not rooms are over  lit.  If they are, then energy is being wasted.  The U.S. Occupational  Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), recommends that in an office  setting, the light intensity be between 20 and 50 foot-candles (OSHA).   As I write this essay, I am sitting in the Students of Engineering  Computer Lab (SOECAL) in Duckering.  The room is quite bright and  approximately 20 ft by 40 ft and holds 15 light fixtures, each  containing three fluorescent bulbs.  The bulbs are GE Ecolux Starcoat  bulbs consuming 32 Watts and producing 2800 lumens a piece (light  bulb).  To determine if this particular room is over lit, the following  calculation is made:</p>
<p>It appears that the SOECAL lab is over lit by three times the amount  of recommended light for a work office, perhaps other similar classrooms  and computer labs are as well.  Since we can assume the SOECAL lab and  many other rooms are over lit, it can also be determined how much energy  is being wasted and how much it is costing.  The following calculations  are performed considering a single bulb for a single hour.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>In the room where he is writing no less. More tomorrow.</p>
