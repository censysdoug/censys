										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have come to despise Joe Machin. The entire Senate turns on whether he will vote for something. He has derailed the stringent Climate Change provisions of Built Back Better bill, and acted like it was a boon that he voted for a Black Woman to the Supreme Court. He is a waste of human space. Joe Manchin helped a West Virginia power plant that is the sole customer of his private coal business. Along the way, he blocked ambitious climate action.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/08/manchin-family-coal-company-00003218">https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/08/manchin-family-coal-company-00003218</a></p>
<p>This article is from the NY Times but its tagline would not load up so I used the one above. from politico. I think if you click on the author you may get through. In fact I clicked on the active author link and it took me right through so you get 2 articles for the nonprice of 1.</p>

<p class="css-g5piaz evys1bk0">GRANT TOWN, W.Va. — On a hilltop overlooking Paw Paw Creek, 15 miles south of the Pennsylvania border, looms a fortresslike structure with a single smokestack, the only viable business in a dying Appalachian town.</p>
<p class="css-g5piaz evys1bk0">The Grant Town power plant is also the link between the coal industry and the personal finances of Joe Manchin III, the Democrat who rose through state politics to reach the United States Senate, where, through the vagaries of electoral politics, he is now <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/climate/manchin-climate-biden.html?searchResultPosition=21">the single most important figure</a> shaping the nation’s energy and climate policy.</p>
<p class="css-g5piaz evys1bk0">Mr. Manchin’s ties to the Grant Town plant date to 1987, when he had just been elected to the West Virginia Senate, a part-time job with base pay of $6,500. His family’s carpet business was struggling.</p>
<p class="css-g5piaz evys1bk0">Opportunity arrived in the form of two developers who wanted to build a power plant in Grant Town, just outside Mr. Manchin’s district. Mr. Manchin, whose grandfather went to work in the mines at age 9 and whose uncle died in a mining accident, helped the developers clear bureaucratic hurdles.</p>

<p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">One hundred years ago, Congress passed the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, setting up a system in which companies lease public lands to wrest valuable oil and gas from the ground. In the century since, the royalties and rent that those corporations pay to the American people for access have remained essentially unchanged even as the scale of development and profits has grown hugely.</p>
<p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">As senators from different parties, we have our share of policy differences. But we both believe in sticking up for the public interest and the taxpayer. In this case, we agree that oil and gas companies should pay fair market value for the public resources they extract and sell. They aren’t doing that now — not even close — and the American public is the big loser.</p>
<p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">That’s why we <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.tomudall.senate.gov/news/press-releases/udall-grassley-introduce-bill-to-ensure-taxpayers-get-fair-share-for-public-lands-leasing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced the Fair Returns for Public Lands Act</a> this year to reform the antiquated law that governs royalties and the leasing of public land.</p>
<p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The country’s economy and the oil and gas industries have changed significantly since 1920. Automobiles had just started to replace the horse and buggy, and the oil industry was a relatively new enterprise dominated by the successors of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil. Yet, since then, the federal royalty rate for oil and gas on public lands has remained steady, at a bargain-basement 12.5 percent of the value of what’s extracted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Donald J. Trump is the worst energy President of all time. That takes a lot of doing. Jimmie Carter was real bad on Nuclear Power. George Bush was seriously bad on natural gas and oil. But this alleged policy maker pledged, during the the 2016 campaign, that he would SAVE coal. Under his Presidency the Coal Market has plummeted as has its usage. Even though foreign markets were promised, they have plunged too. Oil futures at one point were trading in negative territory for the first time ever and Nuclear Power Plants are closing. He is opposed to Wind and Solar as they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFHh0Rs34v0">spread across the land</a>. I have a wind turbine within 15 minutes of my house in Riverton and I have a house with total roof solar panels around the corner from me. That says to me that the Cheeto Burito is about to lose office. We shall see.</p>

<p>MARION — Southern Illinois Power Cooperative plans to retire its largest coal-fired generator as early as this fall, a move that is expected to save $125 million over a decade.</p>
</div>
<div class="lee-article-text">
<p>President and CEO Don Gulley said the tentative decision is the result of analysis and negotiations that have been ongoing since late 2019. Gulley said SIPC utilized outside consultants to help it perform a comprehensive review of operations and determine the best path forward. The decision to close Unit 4, as it is known, was based on two primary factors, he said: sustained low energy prices in the wholesale power market, and increasingly costly environmental regulations for coal-fired generators.</p>

<p>Unusually hot and dry conditions in parts of the northern hemisphere have been conducive to fires raging from the Mediterranean to – in particular – the Arctic. Climate change, with rising temperatures and shifts in precipitation patterns, is amplifying the risk of wildfires and prolonging the season.</p>
<p>WMO’s Global Atmosphere Watch Programme has released a <a href="http://https://youtu.be/ZfJsedQlio0">short animation</a> which highlights the risks and explains how advances in satellite technology make it possible to detect and monitor fire dangers. Improving forecasting systems is important for predictions and warnings around fire danger and related air pollution hazards.</p>
<p>In addition to the direct threat from burning, wildfires also release harmful pollutants including particulate matter and toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and non-methane organic compounds into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Particles and gases from burning biomass can be carried over long distances, affecting air quality in regions far away.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A &#8220;multi-post&#8221; that I rarely ever do any more. But this issue is important so first my recommendations, first published on Facebook, and then the facts on the ground.</p>
<p>CWLP IS Doomed</p>
<p>If the members of the City Council of Springfield had any sense at all (and guts/leadership) they would:</p>
<p>1/ Tell IBEW 193 to retrain the workers at Dallman 1 2 and 3 in Solar and Wind<span class="text_exposed_show"><br />
2/ They would close Dallman 1 2 and 3<br />
3/ They would put out a notice for proposals to gasify Dallman<br />
4/ They would take the savings and invest it in renewables<br />
5/ They would ask the County to drop their ridiculous zoning rules for wind farms so we could have a wind farm in Sangamon county</span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>But instead they will live in the 1900s and like Trump demand coal for a fuel source no matter what.</p>
</div>
<p>First the SJ-R</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sj-r.com/news/20190507/report-recommends-cwlp-retire-its-three-oldest-power-units-move-away-from-coal">https://www.sj-r.com/news/20190507/report-recommends-cwlp-retire-its-three-oldest-power-units-move-away-from-coal</a></p>
<h1 class="headline">Report recommends CWLP retire its three oldest power units, move away from coal</h1>
<p>In a much-anticipated report, an energy consulting firm is recommending that City Water, Light and Power retire three of its four coal-fired power generators “as soon as feasible” while offering the utility a roadmap to a less coal-dependent future.</p>
<p>The Energy Authority (TEA), which was retained by the city last year to map out a plan for the utility’s power generation for the next 20 years, released the <a href="https://cwlp.com/IRP.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">84-page “integrated resource plan”</a> on Monday and gave a presentation to members of the Springfield City Council.</p>
<p>The firm recommended that CWLP retire Dallman units 1, 2 and 3 by as early as 2020 after finding that “no scenario economically retained these units.”</p>
<p>The results are not much of a surprise given the age of the units and the current state of the energy market, which has been upended by the rise of natural gas and the increasing affordability of renewable energy. For coal-dependent utilities like CWLP, it has not been easy to keep up.</p>
<p>“One of the things that we’ve been saying for quite some time is that coal-fired units basically can’t compete very well in the market, they’re not competitive in the current market,” said CWLP chief utility engineer Doug Brown. “So this report basically confirms all of that.”</p>
<p>Then the Illinois Times.</p>

<p>How can Springfield’s City Water, Light and Power (CWLP) best provide electrical power to meet the community’s future energy needs? Retiring Dallman Units 1, 2 and 3 coal-fired plants, increasing the use of renewable energy and expanding energy efficiency are some of the recommendations included in a recently released report.</p>
<p>Last year the city hired The Energy Authority (TEA) to develop an Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). Kevin Glake from TEA presented the results of the comprehensive study to the city council on May 6 at a meeting of the Public Utilities Committee. Anyone who uses electricity generated by CWLP or cares about the future of the city’s public utility should be interested in this plan.</p>
<p>Public comments are being accepted now through June 3, and a public open house is scheduled for 5-7 p.m. May 20 at the Lincoln Public Library. More information and the complete plan are available online at https://cwlp.com/IRP.aspx. Comments can be emailed to IRP@cwlp.com or mailed to CWLP General Office, ATTN: CWLP IRP, 800 E. Monroe St., Springfield, 62701.</p>

<p>t’s not a welcome message in council chambers.</p>
<p>“They came back with exactly what everyone on the city council knows,” Ward 1 Ald. Chuck Redpath declared at a May 28 committee-of-the-whole meeting, joining colleagues in criticizing the report issued by The Energy Authority. “The point is, we can’t just…go down without a fight. We’re talking about getting rid of two, maybe three, of our plants, and it’s going to be detrimental to our ratepayers. It’s going to be detrimental because, eventually, you are going to have to go out on the net, and buy off the net – the grid – and then we’re going to be subjected to whatever prices we get stuck with if we’re down to one plant. We’ve got to start thinking outside the box and find a better way.”</p>
<p>And so Redpath and other aldermen cling to coal, even as they talk about new courses. Those opposed to coal have a simple response to complaints about a report that contains no surprises.</p>
<p>“They’re not learning anything new because nothing has changed in six years in terms of the economics of those old units,” says Andy Knott, senior campaign representative for the Sierra Club. “They don’t want to look at the facts and the reality and make the best decisions for the ratepayers.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>“They’re too old”</b></span></p>
<p>“Integrated resource plan,” a tag invented in the 1980s, is the official title of the study that’s drawing ire from aldermen. The planning process is supposed to help utilities figure out long-term economics. Thirty-three states, but not Illinois, require utilities to prepare IRPs that are subject to review by state regulators.</p>

<h3>A thing called capacity—and why it could be devastating to our power bills</h3>

<div class="spacer-20"></div>

<p>When CUB threw its support behind the <strong><a href="https://secure3.convio.net/cerf/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&amp;page=UserAction&amp;id=567" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clean Energy Jobs Act</a></strong>, the watchdog said one of the biggest reasons is an ongoing battle with fossil fuel generators in a special electricity market called the capacity market. If we don’t do something, this could cost most electric customers in the state up to $500 million a year in higher electric bills.</p>
<p>You may not know it, but EVERYONE pays for “capacity” on their electric bills. Here’s what you need to know—and why you should support the Clean Energy Jobs Act.</p>
<p><strong>What is capacity?</strong></p>
<p>Not only do you pay for the power you use now, but you also pay for power you could use in the future. Capacity refers to extra payments consumers give power plant operators for the commitment to have enough electricity available if demand suddenly spikes. (Think of a hot summer afternoon, when everyone blasts the AC.)</p>
<div id="attachment_15943" class="wp-caption alignright"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-15943 size-medium" src="https://www.citizensutilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pjm-map-for-web-v1-300x170.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://www.citizensutilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pjm-map-for-web-v1-300x170.jpg 300w, https://www.citizensutilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pjm-map-for-web-v1.jpg 500w" alt="" width="300" height="170" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15943" /></p>
<p id="caption-attachment-15943" class="wp-caption-text">The PJM power grid stretches from Illinois to the East Coast.</p>
</div>
<p>The price for capacity for ComEd customers is determined through auctions run by PJM Interconnection, the power grid operator for northern Illinois and all or part of 12 other states and Washington, D.C.. (Ameren’s market is run by a different power grid operator.)</p>
<p><strong>How does capacity affect my bill?</strong><strong><br />
</strong>For most customers, capacity charges are embedded in the electricity supply charge on your power bill. While actual electricity prices have been relatively low in recent years, capacity has become a bigger and bigger part of your bill, and is now roughly 21 percent of the supply charge, according to the Illinois Commerce Commission. (By the way, alternative energy suppliers as well as ComEd buy electricity on this market. So you won’t escape capacity charges by changing suppliers.)</p>
<p>CUB has long said that capacity market rules are stacked against consumers, causing us to pay higher bills for more capacity than we actually need. But a new plan pushed by PJM and fossil fuel generators could make it even worse.</p>
<p><strong>Why do generators want to change the rules?</strong></p>

Clean Energy was going to chase coal all across the globe as it fought a rear guard action. Then it would become a novelty &#8211; OH LOOK they still use that stupid stuff. Then people will marvel at all the damage it had done and it would go away.</p>

<p class="speakable-p-1 p-text">The embers of the coal industry have been slowly fading in recent years, despite efforts by the Trump administration to reignite the flames.</p>
<p class="speakable-p-2 p-text">But an announcement this week from a northern Indiana utility — in the heart of a state that ranks in the top 10 for both coal production and consumption — suggests the end may be nearer than some expect.</p>
<p class="p-text">After having already announced plans to <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/environment/2018/09/20/move-over-coal-indiana-utility-switching-solar-and-wind/1369539002/" data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a">speed up the retirement of its coal power plants</a>, the Northern Indiana Public Service Company said this week that it will switch to renewable energy to make its electricity instead.</p>
<p class="p-text">Why? Because it&#8217;s cheaper. A lot cheaper, they said, to the tune of more than $4 billion over a few decades. Still, those long-term savings might come with a short-term price. The utility is asking for a raise in its rates to upgrade infrastructure.</p>

<p>The indications of a warming world are numerous and hard to miss. Last year was the third-warmest year on record for both the planet and the United States — exceeded only by 2015 and 2016. In June, scientists reported that Antarctica has lost 3 trillion tons of ice since 1992 — yielding “enough water to cover Texas to a depth of nearly 13 feet,” <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-antarctica-global-warming-20180613-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Associated Press reported</a>.</p>
<p>The indications of inaction on the subject are also abundant and visible. Last year, <a id="PEBSL000163" title="Donald Trump" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics-government/donald-trump-PEBSL000163-topic.html">Donald Trump</a> pulled the United States out of the Paris agreement on greenhouse gas emissions. The <a id="ORGOV000048" title="U.S. Environmental Protection Agency" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/environmental-issues/u.s.-environmental-protection-agency-ORGOV000048-topic.html">Environmental Protection Agency</a> has moved to ease regulations on power plants and motor vehicles that were integral to the Obama administration’s efforts to slow climate change.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Bipartisan action – once a normal response to environmental harms – is not on the agenda for Congress or the White House. But a growing group of farsighted pragmatists are nonetheless trying to find a middle ground between the entrenched adversaries.</p>
