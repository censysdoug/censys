										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Passed ON. That is what all this ruckus is about. What does the non technical phrase &#8211; pass on mean? Large corporations always say things like, &#8220;if you tax us we&#8217;ll just pass the costs on customers&#8221;. Well that assumes the government is going to let you do that. If the government says, &#8220;Nope &#8211; can&#8217;t do that&#8221;. Well, like 2 yros, they can cry and pout, but they can also get sent to their collective rooms. Leave it to PG&amp;E and FLP to try to weasel out of the future.</p>
<p>Then who are these environmental groups in the headline, oh media writer? Its one group in California. Towards the bottom of the piece, and I mean the BOTtom &#8211; he says MOST environmental groups are &#8220;closer to solar&#8217;s position&#8221;. Great reading if you are stuck inside by a foot of snow and road conditions that are dangerous. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>California and Florida are considering revoking a policy that has encouraged homeowners to install rooftop solar panels â causing fear among solar panel owners and installers, and creating divisions in the environmental community.</p>
<p>Utility companies in the two states, some sympathetic politicians and even some environmental advocacy groups are taking aim at subsidies to purchase and install solar panels because they say those costs are ultimately passed on to other ratepayers.</p>
<p>The crux of the issue is a practice called ânet metering,â in which the electricity solar panel owners send back to the grid is removed from their monthly bill. The credits are applied at the same retail rate at which electricity is sold to consumers. Thatâs a higher rate than the wholesale price at which utilities <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://learn.pjm.com/electricity-basics/market-for-electricity.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:buy electricity" data-rapid_p="9">buy electricity</a> from large-scale producers. For example, if the retail rate is 30 cents per kilowatt hour, the amount a utility would pay a bulk producer â like a commercial wind farm â might be 15 cents per kilowatt hour. The difference covers the costs of building and maintaining the electric grid and the utilityâs other overhead costs. (Utilitiesâ profit margins more typically <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://blog.aee.net/how-do-electric-utilities-make-money" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:come from their capital investments" data-rapid_p="10">come from their capital investments</a>.)</p>

<p>Go there and read as much as you can stomach. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Springfield IL has always been opposed to renewable energy. It took a Friend of mine with a degree in Solar Power 20 years at CWLP to get the City to erect a modest Solar Farm. 700 panels, I think. There is no Wind Power because the county changed the zoning ordinances to make turbine placement unfeasible. There is modest geothermal. For homeowners, the City Council is always trying to tax smart meters to Solar more expensive. So why does it not surprise me that CWLP came up withÂ  &#8220;program to prevent global warming&#8221; by continuing to burn tons of coal daily.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sj-r.com/story/news/politics/state/2020/06/04/cwlp-could-become-worldrsquos-largest-carbon-capture-research-station/114279824/">https://www.sj-r.com/story/news/politics/state/2020/06/04/cwlp-could-become-worldrsquos-largest-carbon-capture-research-station/114279824/</a></p>

<h1 class="gnt_ar_hl">CWLP could become worldâs largest carbon capture research station</h1>
<div class="gnt_ar_by">Kade Heather Staff Writer</div>
<p>JUNE 4, 2020</p>
</article>
<p class="gnt_ar_b_p">City Water, Light &amp; Power is on path for constructing the worldâs largest research and development pilot for a new carbon capture system.</p>
<p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The U.S. Department of Energy had about 30 responses from power plants across the country when it initially proposed the idea about three years ago. The DOE has narrowed it down to about five competitors â CWLP being one.</p>
<p class="gnt_ar_b_p">While CWLP is not guaranteed to host the pilot system, Kevin OBrien, director of the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center at the University of Illinois, and the principle investigator overseeing the project, said DOE is âvery impressed by the team,â and by CWLPâs facility.</p>
<p class="gnt_ar_b_p">âThey toured the plant, they feel itâs a very, very well-run plant and theyâre impressed by that, and thatâs an important factor when youâre competing for these types of projects. So thereâs no guarantee, but we think weâve got a really high probability of winning this one,â OBrien said.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and read. Then write letters to the Mayor and the City Council condeming the idea. More next week.</p>

Maybe even because of unnecessary cost over runs. Mainly they do this because &#8220;They want to build more NUCLEAR Power Plants&#8221;. But the fact of the matter is you can&#8217;t build them cheaper and in fact given the costs of the 2 Major Nuclear catastrophes, maybe you need to build them more expensive. The simple fact, is that a new Coal Fired Plant can cost 2 billion dollars and kill the atmosphere while a Uranium Fired Plant could cost 4 billion dollars and kill us.</p>
<p>Anyway here is some discussion of that:</p>

<p>Should any discussion of nuclear power go on for long enough, it becomes inevitable that someone will rant that the only reason it has become unaffordable is a proliferation of safety regulations. The argument is rarely (if ever) fleshed outâno specific regulation is ever identified as problematic, and there seems to be no consideration given to the fact that we might have learned something at, say, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/05/remediating-fukushima-when-everything-goes-to-hell-you-go-back-to-basics/">Fukushima</a> that might merit addressing through regulations.</p>

<p>But there&#8217;s now a paper out that provides some empirical evidence that safety changes have contributed to the cost of building new nuclear reactors. But the study also makes clear that they&#8217;re only one of a number of factors, accounting for only a third of the soaring costs. The study also finds that, contrary to what those in the industry seem to expect, focusing on standardized designs doesn&#8217;t really help matters, as costs continued to grow as more of a given reactor design was built.</p>
<h2>More of the same</h2>
<p>The analysis, done by a team of researchers at MIT, is remarkably comprehensive. For many nuclear plants, they have detailed construction records, broken out by which building different materials and labor went to, and how much each of them cost. There&#8217;s also a detailed record of safety regulations and when they were instituted relative to construction. Finally, they&#8217;ve also brought in the patent applications filed by the companies who designed the reactors. The documents describe the motivations for design changes and the problems those changes were intended to solve.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chernobyl and Fukushima released a lot of radiation. People died from the severe radiation released just after the accident, but &#8220;mild&#8221; consistent radiation is not dangerous to animals though it may have mild effects on adults and bigger effects on children. But the idea that a major radiation release would create one eyed giant humans or fire breathing dragons like wadzzilla is really remote. The fear of radiation has done some pretty amazing things for the environment, however.</p>

Once thought to be forever uninhabitable, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has become a haven for flora and fauna that prove that life, as they say in <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/49904/20-things-you-might-not-have-known-about-jurassic-park" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Jurassic Park</em></a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/oijEsqT2QKQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finds a way</a>.</p>
<h2 class="body title">1. The Animals of Chernobyl Survived Against All Odds</h2>
<p class="body">The effects of the radioactive explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on April 26, 1986 devastated the environment. Around the plant and in the nearby city of Pripyat in Ukraine, the Chernobyl disasterâs radiation caused the leaves of thousands of trees to turn a rust color, giving a new name to the surrounding woodsâthe <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/56235-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-33-years-later-wildlife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Forest</a>. Workers eventually bulldozed and buried the radioactive trees. Squads of Soviet conscripts also were ordered to <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-happened-to-the-dogs-of-chernobyl-the-harrowing-events-of-the-tv-series-are-sadly-true-17928470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoot</a> any stray animals within the 1000-square-mile Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Though experts today believe parts of the zone will remain unsafe for humans for another <a href="https://www.livescience.com/39961-chernobyl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20,000 years</a>, numerous animal and plant species not only survived, but thrived.</p>
<h2 class="body title">2. Bears and Wolves Outnumber Humans Around the Chernobyl Disaster Site</h2>
<p class="body">While humans are strictly prohibited from living in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, many other species have settled there. Brown bears, wolves, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/33677/canada-lynx-ghost-cat-north" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">lynx</a>, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59248/whats-difference-between-bison-and-buffalo" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">bison</a>, deer, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59461/10-gigantic-facts-about-moose" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">moose</a>, beavers, foxes, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64760/10-resourceful-facts-about-badgers" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">badgers</a>, wild boar, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/70797/12-surprising-facts-about-raccoon-dogs" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">raccoon dogs</a>, and more than 200 species of birds have formed their own ecosystem within the Chernobyl disaster area. Along with the larger animals, a variety of amphibians, fish, worms, and bacteria makes the unpopulated environment their home.</p>

<p><strong>What is This Device?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s called ÃkoWatt and its tech was originally created by no other than the legendary Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist, Nikola Tesla.</p>
<p>Initially it was concealed from the general public because it offered average families the opportunity to save on their monthly energy costs.Â <a href="http://track.roinattrack.com/click?cep=2iSzLCQN0QDlUE_kc09NvGhBKa4V9Ds1f1yyex-Z58wWB_8RM5YwHXsOKH9NWUtbuCUSEMRKHQ_0RlDGcUpFlJzGXzi4Q_p74VT-SWA2Q0i-Amg8DFsYirLyDONBCYYGMTX9V7TsDuuIZkSVuIL76ySCYwsuwsEUjTcMDlbbd79ETiuYdHHt5oGNQdr1l1eN7JPAsD9viwI-kdqmdTQvkbPd9bdjXInYoegmhpYVBIUXGEESFgLUY8_CvXOPm9Clow1QlJnEaHOjY_GdeJgzp5p53t2mhHj-vj1kxXzkn49xdzLAV9y76nAZJmRS3uV_nv_UPspIgPLK2NkkliRU4r8uXeozX-1H8ZniVXk_djgY91el84Pbh34N5ozleyRYFKReOdCJ-RDKkHh0ExgHan4LjC9L7uL56NKlOIASPj_sC4R9vbQtBfpCO51NEXXA5XZ8yx2ibfxptiiJ9r4pL9Gas3GK5szYiYN8yVYXopT4LgI9MXdJ2xGppP2wnfHhysBeE3FMbR4NJL1HDz8tfQ&amp;lptoken=154f8257813173a793f7&amp;adversion_id=4238759&amp;ad_id=369037&amp;budget_id=206702&amp;adcampaign_id=150894&amp;publication_id=2853&amp;headline_id=1322572&amp;content_id=279679&amp;previewimage_id=333544&amp;device=desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ÃkoWatt is a small, compact, affordable, and easy-to-use plug-in unit</strong></a><strong>Â </strong>that stops unnecessary power from entering the electrical cables and overloading the network.</p>
<p>ÃkoWatt is your power company&#8217;s worst nightmare. They have been trying to hide ÃkoWatt from the everyday consumer and have even banned it in retail shops.</p>
<p>Big Energy is threatened by this device and its potential to cut into profits.</p>
<p>However, thanks to the Internet, the secret is out, and everyday people are now reaping the rewards of less power consumption overall, <strong><em>as well as that used by household appliances.</em></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week&#8217;s articles says &#8211; Not Likely. I say the trees are a good start. The point is that some people argue for trees or solar panels in the desert for instance. But the desert is an ecosystem that trees or solar panels would disrupt. Deserts are not &#8220;throw away&#8221; ecosystems. So we can only deploy so much of each. This is why i think geothermal is the ultimate solution.</p>

<p>Last week, a new study in the journal <em><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Science (opens in a new tab)">Science</a></em> highlighted the role forests could play in <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2019/07/04/could-planting-tons-of-trees-solve-climate-change/#.XR9vR9NKjm1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="tackling climate change (opens in a new tab)">tackling climate change</a>. Researchers estimated that by restoring forests to their maximum potential, we could cut down atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) by 25 percent â a move that would take us back to levels not seen in over a century. Though the study brings hope in the fight against climate change, other experts warn the solution is not that simple.</p>
<p>The study, led by scientists at ETH-ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland, determined the planet has 0.9 billion hectares of land available to hold more trees â an area the size of the continental U.S. Converting those areas into forests would be a game-changer for climate change, the authors suggested.</p>
<p>â[The study] is probably the best assessment we have to date of how much land could support tree cover on our planet,â says Robin Chazdon, a forest ecologist and professor emeritus at the University of Connecticut not involved in the study, But she is quick to point out that restoring forests is not as simple as it sounds.</p>

<p>Go there and think. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A &#8220;multi-post&#8221; that I rarely ever do any more. But this issue is important so first my recommendations, first published on Facebook, and then the facts on the ground.</p>
<p>CWLP IS Doomed</p>
<p>If the members of the City Council of Springfield had any sense at all (and guts/leadership) they would:</p>
<p>1/ Tell IBEW 193 to retrain the workers at Dallman 1 2 and 3 in Solar and Wind<span class="text_exposed_show"><br />
2/ They would close Dallman 1 2 and 3<br />
3/ They would put out a notice for proposals to gasify Dallman<br />
4/ They would take the savings and invest it in renewables<br />
5/ They would ask the County to drop their ridiculous zoning rules for wind farms so we could have a wind farm in Sangamon county</span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>But instead they will live in the 1900s and like Trump demand coal for a fuel source no matter what.</p>
</div>
<p>First the SJ-R</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sj-r.com/news/20190507/report-recommends-cwlp-retire-its-three-oldest-power-units-move-away-from-coal">https://www.sj-r.com/news/20190507/report-recommends-cwlp-retire-its-three-oldest-power-units-move-away-from-coal</a></p>
<h1 class="headline">Report recommends CWLP retire its three oldest power units, move away from coal</h1>
<p>In a much-anticipated report, an energy consulting firm is recommending that City Water, Light and Power retire three of its four coal-fired power generators âas soon as feasibleâ while offering the utility a roadmap to a less coal-dependent future.</p>
<p>The Energy Authority (TEA), which was retained by the city last year to map out a plan for the utilityâs power generation for the next 20 years, released the <a href="https://cwlp.com/IRP.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">84-page âintegrated resource planâ</a> on Monday and gave a presentation to members of the Springfield City Council.</p>
<p>The firm recommended that CWLP retire Dallman units 1, 2 and 3 by as early as 2020 after finding that âno scenario economically retained these units.â</p>
<p>The results are not much of a surprise given the age of the units and the current state of the energy market, which has been upended by the rise of natural gas and the increasing affordability of renewable energy. For coal-dependent utilities like CWLP, it has not been easy to keep up.</p>
<p>âOne of the things that weâve been saying for quite some time is that coal-fired units basically canât compete very well in the market, theyâre not competitive in the current market,â said CWLP chief utility engineer Doug Brown. âSo this report basically confirms all of that.â</p>
<p>Then the Illinois Times.</p>

<p>How can Springfieldâs City Water, Light and Power (CWLP) best provide electrical power to meet the communityâs future energy needs? Retiring Dallman Units 1, 2 and 3 coal-fired plants, increasing the use of renewable energy and expanding energy efficiency are some of the recommendations included in a recently released report.</p>
<p>Last year the city hired The Energy Authority (TEA) to develop an Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). Kevin Glake from TEA presented the results of the comprehensive study to the city council on May 6 at a meeting of the Public Utilities Committee. Anyone who uses electricity generated by CWLP or cares about the future of the cityâs public utility should be interested in this plan.</p>
<p>Public comments are being accepted now through June 3, and a public open house is scheduled for 5-7 p.m. May 20 at the Lincoln Public Library. More information and the complete plan are available online at https://cwlp.com/IRP.aspx. Comments can be emailed to IRP@cwlp.com or mailed to CWLP General Office, ATTN: CWLP IRP, 800 E. Monroe St., Springfield, 62701.</p>

<p>tâs not a welcome message in council chambers.</p>
<p>âThey came back with exactly what everyone on the city council knows,â Ward 1 Ald. Chuck Redpath declared at a May 28 committee-of-the-whole meeting, joining colleagues in criticizing the report issued by The Energy Authority. âThe point is, we canât justâ¦go down without a fight. Weâre talking about getting rid of two, maybe three, of our plants, and itâs going to be detrimental to our ratepayers. Itâs going to be detrimental because, eventually, you are going to have to go out on the net, and buy off the net â the grid â and then weâre going to be subjected to whatever prices we get stuck with if weâre down to one plant. Weâve got to start thinking outside the box and find a better way.â</p>
<p>And so Redpath and other aldermen cling to coal, even as they talk about new courses. Those opposed to coal have a simple response to complaints about a report that contains no surprises.</p>
<p>âTheyâre not learning anything new because nothing has changed in six years in terms of the economics of those old units,â says Andy Knott, senior campaign representative for the Sierra Club. âThey donât want to look at the facts and the reality and make the best decisions for the ratepayers.â</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>âTheyâre too oldâ</b></span></p>
<p>âIntegrated resource plan,â a tag invented in the 1980s, is the official title of the study thatâs drawing ire from aldermen. The planning process is supposed to help utilities figure out long-term economics. Thirty-three states, but not Illinois, require utilities to prepare IRPs that are subject to review by state regulators.</p>

<div class="spacer-20"></div>
<div>
<p>When CUB threw its support behind the <strong><a href="https://secure3.convio.net/cerf/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&amp;page=UserAction&amp;id=567" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clean Energy Jobs Act</a></strong>, the watchdog said one of the biggest reasons is an ongoing battle with fossil fuel generators in a special electricity market called the capacity market. If we donât do something, this could cost most electric customers in the state up to $500 million a year in higher electric bills.</p>
<p>You may not know it, but EVERYONE pays for âcapacityâ on their electric bills. Hereâs what you need to knowâand why you should support the Clean Energy Jobs Act.</p>
<p><strong>What is capacity?</strong></p>
<p>Not only do you pay for the power you use now, but you also pay for power you could use in the future. Capacity refers to extra payments consumers give power plant operators for the commitment to have enough electricity available if demand suddenly spikes. (Think of a hot summer afternoon, when everyone blasts the AC.)</p>
<div id="attachment_15943" class="wp-caption alignright"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-15943 size-medium" src="https://www.citizensutilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pjm-map-for-web-v1-300x170.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" srcset="https://www.citizensutilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pjm-map-for-web-v1-300x170.jpg 300w, https://www.citizensutilityboard.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pjm-map-for-web-v1.jpg 500w" alt="" width="300" height="170" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15943" /></p>
<p id="caption-attachment-15943" class="wp-caption-text">The PJM power grid stretches from Illinois to the East Coast.</p>
</div>
<p>The price for capacity for ComEd customers is determined through auctions run by PJM Interconnection, the power grid operator for northern Illinois and all or part of 12 other states and Washington, D.C.. (Amerenâs market is run by a different power grid operator.)</p>
<p><strong>How does capacity affect my bill?</strong><strong><br />
</strong>For most customers, capacity charges are embedded in the electricity supply charge on your power bill. While actual electricity prices have been relatively low in recent years, capacity has become a bigger and bigger part of your bill, and is now roughly 21 percent of the supply charge, according to the Illinois Commerce Commission. (By the way, alternative energy suppliers as well as ComEd buy electricity on this market. So you wonât escape capacity charges by changing suppliers.)</p>
<p>CUB has long said that capacity market rules are stacked against consumers, causing us to pay higher bills for more capacity than we actually need. But a new plan pushed by PJM and fossil fuel generators could make it even worse.</p>
<p><strong>Why do generators want to change the rules?</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seriously, if Love Canal wouldn&#8217;t take it then there are Super Fund sites like Rocky Flats Weapons Factory that would. We could put up honorary members like the originators and manufacturers of Agent Orange, Whose ever idea leaded gasoline was, maybe the inventor and manufacturers of Mustard Gas. But the people who proposed and actually carried out atomic fracking must go near the top of the list.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago Pennsylvania officials were presented a plan to detonate a nuclear device below north-central Pennsylvania. While the project never got past the planning stages it was part of a larger plan to use nuclear bombs in natural gas extraction.Â (<cite>Pennsylvania State Archives</cite>)</p>

<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This story has been update to fix broken art on this article.</em></p>
<p>HARRISBURG &#8212; In May 1966, Columbia Gas and the federal Atomic Energy Commission presented an audacious plan to a representative of the Governor&#8217;s Science Advisory Committee: A proposal to detonate a nuclear bomb more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima 3,500 feet below north-central Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the present stage, this proposal involves a detonation of a &#8216;shot&#8217; of perhaps 20,000 tons TNT equivalent at a location on the boundary between Centre and Clinton counties,&#8221; wrote Louis Roddis Jr., the governor&#8217;s representative in his report.</p>
<p>The goal was to use the nuclear blast to create a chamber that could then be filled with pressurized natural gas. Named Project Ketch, the proposal was an offshoot of another nuclear explosive-powered idea, Project Gasbuggy, which called on increasing natural gas production by detonating nuclear bombs underground to fracture rock deposits &#8212; nuclear fracking.</p>
<p>From the get-go, however, Roddis noted there would be challenges to the proposal. Safety considerations, he wrote, fell under three categories: seismic problems, immediate radioactivity problems, and long-term radioactivity problems.</p>
