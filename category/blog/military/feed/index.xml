With just 78 planes in the air and Tanks running out of fuel the Russian attack appears uncoordinated and without passion. There are even rumors of Russian Units laying down their guns. In part here is why. Think about Brazil attacking Spain.</p>

<p>Russia&#8217;s economy is &#8220;incredibly unimportant in the global economy except for oil and gas,&#8221; Jason Furman, a Harvard economist and former advisor to President Barack Obama, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/21/business/economy/ukraine-russia-economy.html?smid=tw-share" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="3833ffc99460c6de181a669dc35eb096">The New York Times.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s basically a big gas station,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His comments come as the West prepares <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/21/statement-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-on-russian-announcement-on-eastern-ukraine/" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="7bd2d70c52d7b2017ceccb055122336e">heavy sanctions</a> on Russia if it invades Ukraine. While they have the potential to throw the Russian economy into chaos, these measures could also reverberate to further damage the US, Europe, and the rest of the world as they battle inflation and rising energy prices — a ripple effect that the West hopes to mitigate.</p>
<p>On Monday, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/map-where-are-donetsk-luhansk-ukraine-russia-2022-2" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="f1a4c149a6bb8c3977ad89ca46bfbafb">Moscow declared the independence of two breakaway regions of Ukraine and sent troops there</a> — escalating the prospect of a major war. President Joe Biden has already <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-orders-sanctions-russia-backed-eastern-ukraine-separatist-regions-2022-2" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="bf7125005aab9537167f85ca2b703e20">ordered sanctions</a> on the separatist regions — Donetsk and Luhansk — prohibiting US citizens from engaging in any exports, imports, or new investments in these areas.</p>
<p>Despite Russia&#8217;s size and wealth in raw materials, its economy is more on par with Brazil than with nations like Germany, France, and the UK, <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?most_recent_value_desc=false" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="60" data-uri="8081f643505061a94e157a69ddaf0bbb">according to the latest nominal GDP data from the World Bank.</a> According to the World Bank, Russia&#8217;s economy is smaller than Italy&#8217;s and South Korea&#8217;s, two nations with less than half of Russia&#8217;s population.</p>

<h2 class="entry-title fusion-post-title" data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="27">Installation of New England’s Largest Battery Energy Storage System is Underway</h2>
<div class="post-content">
<p>NEC Energy Solutions has begun the installation and commissioning of a 2 MW, 3.9MWh GSS® grid energy storage solution for the Sterling Municipal Light Department (SMLD) in Sterling, Massachusetts. Once complete in December 2016, it will be the largest system of its kind installed in New England and the first utility scale project in the State. In the event of an extended grid outage due to a natural disaster, this utility scale Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) can be used to power local emergency response facilities using power generated from two nearby solar plants. The system will also provide enhanced clean energy usage and cost savings to the town of Sterling.</p>
<p>Sandia provided SMLD with analysis to identify the optimal deployment site, amount, and installation type of energy storage within budgetary limits. Sandia also assisted with crafting a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the BESS system, vetting bids, and installing and dispatching the system. “Sandia was instrumental in helping us pull that together. We had developed a minor RFP and they brought in the technical support that we needed to get this done right. Working with Dan Borneo and Ray Byrne on this project has been very valuable to us,” said Sean Hamilton, General Manager of SMLD.</p>
<p>Going forward, Sandia will help SMLD oversee the operation of the BESS to optimally maximize economic returns while safeguarding SMLD’s ability to provide resilient power; monitor BESS operations; and collect operational data for one-year post-commissioning. The data will be used to further the U.S. Department of Energy’s/Sandia’s understanding of the benefits and applications of battery storage in the utility context and provide a number of important battery use cases in resiliency, cost savings, and revenues that can be adopted by numerous municipal utilities and vertically integrated utilities.</p>

Thus the amazing charges in this case. What about the lax security measures? That is where the prosecution should start.</p>

<h1>Muzzling an Anti-Nuke Trial Defense</h1>
<div>
<div>November 21, 2012</div>
</div>
<p>By John LaForge</p>
<p>Three disarmament radicals who snuck into the Y-12 nuclear weapons complex last summer are preparing for their February 2013 trial, and face the prospect that any mention of nuclear weapons will be forbidden.</p>
<p>Y-12 is the 811-acre site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, that’s been building H-bombs and contaminating workers and the environment since 1943. On July 28, Sister Megan Rice, Michael Walli and Greg Boertje-Obed snipped through fences and walked up to the new Highly Enriched Uranium Materials Facility building. They unfurled banners, spray-painted the building with phrases such as “Woe to the empire of blood,” poured blood, prayed and broke bread.</p>
<p>Now they face felony charges that carry a maximum of $500,000 in fines and 15 years in prison. Additionally, in what looks like an attempt to scare them into pleading guilty now, federal prosecutors have mentioned bringing two heavier charges, including sabotage “during wartime,” which together carry up to 50 years imprisonmen</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am only going to post a little bit of this article. This is so in part because I have serious trouble calling killers of humans environmentalists. Still the point is that if all the militaries in the world just quit using any fuel tomorrow the price of all those fuels would crash and stay very low in price for a very long time. So here is a very little bit of a very good article. I mean really anything that gets Inhofe to pound on his table is a very good thing indeed.</p>
<h1>The Real Reason the Military is Going Green</h1>
<div>Big Oil is a big risk for national security. Can our military—the world&#8217;s No. 1 oil guzzler—change the politics of climate change?</div>
<div></div>
<div>by <a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/@@also-by?author=Natalie+Pompilio">Natalie Pompilio</a></div>
<div>posted Jun 04, 2012</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Retired Brig. Gen. Steven Anderson calls himself  “an accidental environmentalist.”</p>
<p>His epiphany about climate change started with a tactical problem. In 2006 and 2007, when he served as the military’s chief logistician in Iraq, he coordinated the transport of millions of gallons of fuel across the country to power everything from vehicles to the large compressors used to cool individual tents—or, as Anderson puts it, for “air conditioning the desert.” He was taking one casualty for every 24 fuel convoys, and he was doing 18 convoys a day. That’s one casualty every other day. He needed to get the trucks off the road. He needed to find a way to reduce the military’s fuel use.</p>
<div>The question remains, can the weight and pragmatism of military leadership sway political leaders in Washington?</div>
<p>“There’s a direct relationship between energy and the military. The more energy consumed, the less effective you are militarily because you’re more vulnerable,” said Anderson, who reported to General David Petraeus. “They love to take out our field trucks. They make a big boom when they do.”</p>
<p>Since then, Anderson, like many military leaders, has realized that guzzling oil makes the United States vulnerable in other ways. “I’m a soldier,” Anderson said. “Why should I be concerned about climate change? Climate change brings about global instability. That makes the world more vulnerable and it’s more likely that soldiers like myself will have to fight and die somewhere.”</p>
<p>Never mind D.C. conservatives who claim to be tough on defense and suspicious of climate science: The Department of Defense isn’t denying that climate change is a major national security threat. “The change is happening. It’s just a reality,” said retired Marine Col. Mark Mykleby, a former strategy assistant to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “Science tells us it’s coming our way.”</p>

<h1>U.S. military kicks more ass by using less fossil-fuel energy</h1>
<p>By <a title="Posts by David Roberts" href="http://grist.org/author/david-roberts/">David Roberts</a></p>
<p><em>This is my contribution to a <a href="http://energy.nationaljournal.com/2012/05/powering-our-military-whats-th.php">dialogue on the military and clean energy</a> being hosted by </em>National Journal<em>.</em></p>
<p>To understand the promise of renewable energy for the U.S. military, it helps to start as far from Washington, D.C., as possible. (This is true for most forms of understanding.) Start far from the politicians, even from the military brass, far from the rooms where big-money decisions are made, far out on the leading edge of the conflict, with a small company of Marines in Afghanistan’s Sangin River Valley</p>
<p>Not long ago, for a three-day mission out of a forward operating base in Afghanistan, each Marine would have humped between 20 and 35 pounds of batteries. One of the reasons Marines are so lethal in such small numbers today is that they are constantly connected by radios and computers. But radios and computers require a constant supply of batteries, brought by convoy over some of the deadliest roads on earth and then piled on the backs of Marines in highly kinetic environments.</p>
<p>In late 2010, India Company, from the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, tried something new. They packed Solar Portable Alternative Communications Energy Systems, or SPACES — flexible solar panels, 64 square inches, that weigh about 2.5 pounds each. One 1st Lieutenant from India 3/5 later boasted that his patrol shed 700 pounds.</p>

And to top it off the President of Israel thinks the plan is worked out. This is so wrong in so many ways I lost count at 100. What a pitiful waste for so much promise in Obama.</p>

<p><strong>Kurt Nimmo</strong><br />
Infowars.com<br />
May 16, 2012</p>
<p>The U.S. ambassador to Israel, <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/the-us-military-option-for-iran-is-ready-american-ambassador-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Shaprio</a>, told a closed conference in Tel Aviv that the United States has completed preparations for a military strike on Iran. His comments were recorded by a reporter and aired on Israel’s Channel 2 TV on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>It would be preferable to resolve this diplomatically, and through the use of pressure, than to use military force,” Shapiro said. “But that does not mean that option isn’t available. Not just available, it’s ready. The necessary planning has been done to ensure that it’s ready.”</p>
<p>Shaprio’s comments were not intended for public consumption, the Times of Israel reports.</p>
<p>The finalized attack plan arrives as Israel and the United States prepare for joint military exercises in the United States. “The exercises, to be held in the coming months, will strengthen the relationship between the IAF and the US Air Force as they practice carrying out joint operations,” the Jerusalem-based online newspaper reported. “Israeli and US air defense forces are also to take part in a major joint drill later this summer in Israel to simulate a massive attack. Thousands of US soldiers are expected to arrive in Israel for the drills.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to end the year with something positive like I did the Friday before Christmas. But this has been a meditation on national environmental events and it would be impossible no matter what the topic to not post about this. I mean how inept must you be to erect a WOOD scaffolding in a shipyard let alone one around a rubber coated nuclear submarine. A shipyard where they do things like weld, work with rivets and cut steel. How could they not start a fire. The good news is that no exterior fire is ever going to get inside an nuclear submarine. The bad news is that the rubber is probably filled with top secret exotic toxic materials which could kill or sicken the workers and people who live in nearby towns. Welcome to 2012 everyone.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/officials-say-russian-nuclear-submarine-on-fire-in-arctic-shipyard-no-leak-or-casualties/2011/12/29/gIQAd9YYOP_story.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/officials-say-russian-nuclear-submarine-on-fire-in-arctic-shipyard-no-leak-or-casualties/2011/12/29/gIQAd9YYOP_story.html</a></p>

<h1>Russia says nuclear sub fire has been doused, no radiation leak</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h3>By  Associated Press, Published: December 29 |  		Updated: Friday, December 30, 6:28 AM</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>MOSCOW — Firefighters extinguished a massive fire aboard a docked  Russian nuclear submarine Friday as some crew members remained inside,  officials said, assuring that there was no radiation leak and that the  vessel’s nuclear-tipped missiles were not on board.</p>
<p>Military prosecutors have launched an investigation into  whether safety regulations were breached, and President Dmitry Medvedev  summoned top Cabinet officials to report on the situation and demanded  punishment for anyone found responsible.</p>
</div>
<p>The fire broke out Thursday at an Arctic shipyard outside the  northwestern Russian city of Murmansk where the submarine Yekaterinburg  was in dry-dock. The blaze, which shot orange flames high into the air  through the night, was put out Friday afternoon and firefighters  continued to spray the vessel with water to cool it down, Emergency  Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu said.</p>
<p>Russian state television  earlier showed the rubber-coated hull of the submarine still smoldering,  with firefighters gathering around it and some standing on top to douse  it with water.</p>
<p>Seven members of the submarine crew were hospitalized after inhaling poisonous carbon monoxide fumes from the fire, Shoigu said.</p>
<p>An  unspecified number of crew remained inside the submarine during the  fire, Defense Ministry spokesman Col. Igor Konashenkov said in a  statement. He insisted there never was any danger of it spreading inside  the sub and said the crew reported that the conditions on board  remained normal.</p>
<p>Konashenkov’s statement left it unclear whether the crew were trapped there or ordered to stay inside.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know, it is really hard to have fun with a nuclear disaster. You have heard the phrase of course, digging a hole to China. It became a popular phrase in the late 1880s because China was so far away and exotic and because it is on the &#8220;opposite side of the world&#8221;. However as this vido points out that phrase is spectacularly wrong.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAxGccJNw0A">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAxGccJNw0A</a></p>
<p>So a nuclear disaster here in the US would actually amount to a St. Paul syndrome and a nuclear disaster in Japan would amount to a Falklands syndrome. Every since the discussion about what would happen if a nuclear reactor core got out of its containment and of course the wildly popular but who knows how true to real life movie &#8220;China Syndrome&#8221;, I&#8217;ve had serious doubts. The first premise is that the reactor core is &#8220;running&#8221; when it breaches the power station. The second premise is that it would tunnel down to the Earth&#8217;s magma. The third premise is that would somehow amount to an explosion that would end the world. Comon. Even in pristine imaginary terms that probably does not happen. First that is a lot of bedrock to eat through and the reactor still maintain its symmetry. No symmetry no nuclear reaction. Second if it hit the magma, it would lead to a volcanic eruption but we have those all the time. Am I saying it would be a good thing. NO. I just got doubts. These 2 authors think otherwise.</p>

<p>By<em> </em><em><a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/">Washington’s Blog</a></em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve repeatedly noted that we may experience a &#8220;China syndrome&#8221; type of accident at Fukushima.</p>
<p>For example, I <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/09/massive-new-radiation-releases-possible-from-fukushima-especially-if-melted-core-materials-hit-water.html">pointed ou</a>t in September:</p>
<p>Mainichi Dailly News <a href="http://mdn.mainichi.jp/perspectives/news/20110909p2a00m0na016000c.html">notes</a>:</p>
<p>As a radiation meteorology and nuclear safety expert at Kyoto University&#8217;s Research Reactor Institute, Hiroaki Koide [says]:</p>
<p>The nuclear disaster is ongoing.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At present, I believe that there is a possibility that massive  amounts of radioactive materials will be released into the environment  again.</p>
<p>At the No. 1 reactor, there&#8217;s a chance that melted fuel has burned  through the bottom of the pressure vessel, the containment vessel and  the floor of the reactor building, and has sunk into the ground. From  there, radioactive materials may be seeping into the ocean and groundwater.</p>

<p>It is kind of a return to our old Jam Band Friday format.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Anyway crossing the boundaries between green transportation, energy policy and crowd control, the Germans announced they had come to an agreement to sell Saudia Arabia 200 of their Leopard 2A1 battle main tanks. As Der Speigel quickly pointed out such a sale sends both a crazy signal to Germany&#8217;s large peace community but a defeatist one to those countries involved in the Arab Spring (read: food riots). But when it comes to crushing resistance any battle main usually weighs over 50 ton, so that works out pretty well. Do not be fooled either by the nameless chinese man&#8217;s dance with the Chinese battle main because that was a once in a century event. The Arab drivers prefer to get them  babies up to their top speeds of 45 miles per hour and roll. At those speeds they get a whopping 1.3333 miles per gallon. But at more cautious battle speeds they get something more like 4 &#8211; 5 miles per gallon. Kinda like a 1963 red corvette. Or maybe a Hummer. But when you compare it to its actual soul mates like the Caterpillar 797 which gets a heart pumping 3 miles per gallon at the same speeds the Leopard is a true jungle cat. OK well I have had enough fun for today.</p>

<h1>Should Germany Sell Tanks to Saudi Arabia?</h1>

<p>Troops of the 37th Armored Infantry Brigade (37. Panzergrenadierbrigade) prepare to board their Marder light tanks.</p>
</div>
<div>It&#8217;s never easy to balance idealism with political realities,  but as Germany grapples with the challenges posed by the Arab Spring it  is sometimes hard to tell which side</div>
<div>Berlin is on.</div>
</div>
<p>The capital&#8217;s latest foreign-policy faux pas is an alleged  behind-closed-doors deal to sell state-of-the-art tanks to Saudi Arabia.  The deal — so secret the government won&#8217;t even acknowledge it was ever  discussed — has kicked up a firestorm of protest, uniting an unlikely  coalition of leftist politicians, human-rights groups, church leaders  and senior members of Chancellor Angela Merkel&#8217;s own Christian  Democratic Union (CDU) party. <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1977010,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(See &#8220;Angela Merkel: German Rules.&#8221;)</a></p>
<p>News of the deal broke on Sunday, when the newsweekly <em>Der Spiegel</em> reported that Germany&#8217;s ultra-secretive Federal Security Council, whose  members include Merkel, Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, and Defense  Minister Thomas De Maiziere, approved the sale of 200 Leopard 2 tanks,  Germany&#8217;s most modern battlefield tank, to Saudi Arabia. During a  meeting of the CDU parliamentary group on Monday, Norbert Lammert, the  president of the Bundestag — the German parliament — and Ruprecht  Polenz, head of parliament&#8217;s influential foreign affairs committee,  argued forcefully that Germany could not sell such heavy arms to a  country known for routine violations of the most basic human rights.  &#8220;Such decisions cannot be taken at a time when people are fighting for  democracy in the Arab world,&#8221; said Juergen Trittin, a Green Party  leader, on German television on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Protests have also been raining in from church leaders and human-rights  activists, who argue that Saudi Arabia is on the wrong side of history  in the tide of rebellion sweeping through the Arab world. As the  momentum of protests in Tunisia and Egypt carried the Arab Spring into  the tiny nation of Bahrain last March, some 2,000 troops from Arab  nations close to the ruling monarchy, including heavily armed Saudis,  quashed the rebellion. Meanwhile, the German government still faces  criticism for abstaining from the U.N. Security Council vote authorizing  air strikes in support of Libyan rebels, and still refuses to offer  direct military aid, even after softening its position (it does provide  about $5.3 million in financial assistance for NATO&#8217;s Libya mission.)  Against that backdrop, even Merkel&#8217;s closest party allies are at a loss  to justify the sale of weapons to a nation with a history of oppression.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2029774_2029776_2031839,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(See where Angela Merkel falls on the most powerful women list.)</a></p>
<p>The deal, were it to take place, is stunning not only because of the  political signal it sends to pro-democracy activists in the Middle East  and North Africa. A weapons sale of that order would mark a significant  change in German arms-export policies. For the past 20 years, Germany  has refused to sell such heavy artillery to the Saudis, citing concerns  over human-rights abuses. German law also forbids weapons exports to  countries engaged in a direct conflict — though the definition of  conflict is open to interpretation.</p>

<p>The Leopard 2 tank is manufactured in Germany but is also produced under  license in Spain. And the Saudis are believed to have also negotiated with the Spanish,  putting Madrid and Berlin in competition for defense jobs. Germany has a  small army and with the end of the Cold War there is little requirement  for tanks like the Leopard 2 on potential European battlefields. NATO  is scaling back its traditional European land defenses in favor of  lighter, rapid deployment forces to support campaigns out of the  European theater, such as Afghanistan. The shrinking demand at home  leaves defense companies looking abroad for contracts.</p>

<p>The <strong>Leopard 2E</strong> (<em>E</em> stands for <em>España</em>, <a title="Spanish language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language">Spanish</a> for Spain) is a variant of the German <a title="Leopard 2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard_2">Leopard 2</a> <a title="Main battle tank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_battle_tank">main battle tank</a>, tailored to the requirements of the <a title="Spanish Army" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Army">Spanish Army</a>, which acquired it as part of an armament modernization program named <em><a title="Programa Coraza (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Programa_Coraza&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Programa Coraza</a></em>, or Program Armor. The acquisition program for the Leopard 2E began in 1994, five years after the cancellation of the <a title="Lince (tank)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lince_%28tank%29">Lince</a> tank program that culminated in an agreement to transfer 108 <a title="Leopard 2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard_2#Leopard_2A4">Leopard 2A4s</a> to the Spanish Army in 1998 and started the local production of the  Leopard 2E in December 2003. Despite postponement of production due to  the 2003 merger between Santa Bárbara Sistemas and <a title="General Dynamics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics">General Dynamics</a> and continued fabrication issues between 2006 and 2007, 219 Leopard 2Es have been delivered to the Spanish Army.</p>
<p>The Leopard 2E is a major improvement over the <a title="M60 Patton" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M60_Patton">M60 Patton</a> tank, which it replaced in Spain&#8217;s mechanized and armored units. Its  development represented a total of 2.6 million hours worth of work,  9,600 of them in Germany, at a total cost of 1.9 billion <a title="Euros" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euros">euros</a>.  This makes it one of the most expensive Leopard 2s built. Indigenous  production amounted to 60% and the vehicles were assembled locally at <a title="Sevilla" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla">Sevilla</a> by Santa Bárbara Sistemas. It has thicker armor on the <a title="Gun turret" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_turret">turret</a> and <a title="Glacis" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacis">glacis</a> plate than the German Leopard 2A6, and uses a Spanish-designed tank  command and control system, similar to the one fitted in German Leopard  2s. The Leopard 2E is expected to remain in service until 2025.</p>
