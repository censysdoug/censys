										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Passed ON. That is what all this ruckus is about. What does the non technical phrase &#8211; pass on mean? Large corporations always say things like, &#8220;if you tax us we&#8217;ll just pass the costs on customers&#8221;. Well that assumes the government is going to let you do that. If the government says, &#8220;Nope &#8211; can&#8217;t do that&#8221;. Well, like 2 yros, they can cry and pout, but they can also get sent to their collective rooms. Leave it to PG&amp;E and FLP to try to weasel out of the future.</p>
<p>Then who are these environmental groups in the headline, oh media writer? Its one group in California. Towards the bottom of the piece, and I mean the BOTtom &#8211; he says MOST environmental groups are &#8220;closer to solar&#8217;s position&#8221;. Great reading if you are stuck inside by a foot of snow and road conditions that are dangerous. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>California and Florida are considering revoking a policy that has encouraged homeowners to install rooftop solar panels â causing fear among solar panel owners and installers, and creating divisions in the environmental community.</p>
<p>Utility companies in the two states, some sympathetic politicians and even some environmental advocacy groups are taking aim at subsidies to purchase and install solar panels because they say those costs are ultimately passed on to other ratepayers.</p>
<p>The crux of the issue is a practice called ânet metering,â in which the electricity solar panel owners send back to the grid is removed from their monthly bill. The credits are applied at the same retail rate at which electricity is sold to consumers. Thatâs a higher rate than the wholesale price at which utilities <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://learn.pjm.com/electricity-basics/market-for-electricity.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:buy electricity" data-rapid_p="9">buy electricity</a> from large-scale producers. For example, if the retail rate is 30 cents per kilowatt hour, the amount a utility would pay a bulk producer â like a commercial wind farm â might be 15 cents per kilowatt hour. The difference covers the costs of building and maintaining the electric grid and the utilityâs other overhead costs. (Utilitiesâ profit margins more typically <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://blog.aee.net/how-do-electric-utilities-make-money" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:come from their capital investments" data-rapid_p="10">come from their capital investments</a>.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me very quickly say, that I wish no immediate harm to the simpering moron (sigh). I am not urging anybody anywhere to do any harm to the coal toad.Â  All I am say is that after he dies of Black Lung, I hope bad things happen to him.</p>
<p>He is not even a Democrat. He is a DINO: Democrat In Name Only. He knows the majority is thin and thus his power is great. So behind the flag of Fiscal Responsibility he argues for a smaller bill. A Bill that can &#8220;get paid for&#8221;. What gets dropped out of that smaller bill? Surprise! Surprise! The Climate Change program that his coal sucking buddies hate. I mean this is from Vanity Fair for God&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p class="has-dropcap">Although <strong>Joe Manchin</strong> has been holding up <strong>Joe Biden</strong>âs infrastructure plans for a while now over the price tag, the West Virginia senator has been somewhat cagey about his actual demands. Not as guarded, perhaps, as <strong>Kyrsten Sinema</strong>, his fellow Democratic holdout; where she has <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/09/what-exactly-does-kyrsten-sinema-want">refused</a> to state her terms to anyone outside the White House, Manchin at least engages with his colleagues and speaks publicly about his objections to the reconciliation bill. But heâs been difficult to pin down nonetheless, adding to the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/nancy-pelosi-democrats-infrastructure-deal">frustrations</a> of Democrats as they seek to deliver on the centerpiece of Bidenâs domestic agenda.</p>
<p>Finally, while his terms are coming into clearer view, theyâre only casting the future of the infrastructure bills in a thicker cloud of uncertainty.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just like CANCER. That was the first thought I had when I read this article. Evidence was gathered 60 years ago. People spoke up, and the oil and gas industry killed any discussion. Now we are stuck with more powerful Hurricanes. We are stuck with the American west being consumed by droughts and fire. The Arctic is gone and the Antarctic going. The world should confiscate their wealth and apply every dime to remediating the effects. Unfortunately the whole world never does anything. I mean the UN could pass a resolution but Pfffhh.</p>

<p class="dcr-s23rjr"><span class="dcr-114to15"><span class="dcr-1jnp7wy">I</span></span><span class="dcr-s23rjr">n August 1974, the CIA produced a study on âclimatological research as it pertains to intelligence problemsâ. The diagnosis was dramatic. It warned of the emergence of a new era of weird weather, leading to political unrest and mass migration (which, in turn, would cause more unrest). The new era the agency imagined wasnât necessarily one of hotter temperatures; the CIA had heard from scientists warning of global cooling as well as warming. But the direction in which the thermometer was traveling wasnât their immediate concern; it was the political impact. They knew that the so-called â<a title="" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/29/little-ice-age" data-link-name="in body link">little ice age</a>â, a series of cold snaps between, roughly, 1350 and 1850, had brought not only drought and famine, but also war â and so could these new climatic changes.</span></p>
<p class="dcr-s23rjr">âThe climate change began in 1960,â the reportâs first page informs us, âbut no one, including the climatologists, recognized it.â Crop failures in the Soviet Union and India in the early 1960s had been attributed to standard unlucky weather. The US shipped grain to India and the Soviets killed off livestock to eat, âand premier Nikita Khrushchev was quietly deposedâ.</p>
<p class="dcr-s23rjr">But, the report argued, the world ignored this warning, as the global population continued to grow and states made massive investments in energy, technology and medicine.</p>

<p class="has-dropcap has-dropcap__lead-standard-heading paywall"><strong>I</strong>n what may be the most cataclysmic day so far for the traditional fossil-fuel industry, a remarkable set of shareholder votes and court rulings have scrambled the future of three of the worldâs largest oil companies. On Wednesday, a court in the Netherlands ordered Royal Dutch Shell to dramatically cut its emissions over the next decadeâa mandate it can likely only meet by dramatically changing its business model. A few hours later, sixty-one per cent of shareholders at Chevron <a class="external-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chevron-shareholders-approve-proposal-cut-customer-emissions-2021-05-26/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chevron-shareholders-approve-proposal-cut-customer-emissions-2021-05-26/&quot;}">voted</a>, over management objections, to demand that the company cut so-called Scope 3 emissions, which include emissions caused by its customers burning its products. Oil companies are willing to address the emissions that come from their operations, but, as Reuters <a class="external-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chevron-shareholders-approve-proposal-cut-customer-emissions-2021-05-26/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chevron-shareholders-approve-proposal-cut-customer-emissions-2021-05-26/&quot;}">pointed out</a>, the support for the cuts âshows growing investor frustration with companies, which they believe are not doing enough to tackle climate change.â The most powerful proof of such frustration came shortly afterward, as ExxonMobil officials <a class="external-link" href="https://stocksnewsfeed.com/cnbc/engine-no-1-wins-at-least-2-exxon-board-seats-as-activist-pushes-for-climate-strategy-change" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://stocksnewsfeed.com/cnbc/engine-no-1-wins-at-least-2-exxon-board-seats-as-activist-pushes-for-climate-strategy-change&quot;}">announced</a> that shareholders had (over the companyâs strenuous opposition) elected two dissident candidates to the companyâs board, both of whom pledge to push for climate action.</p>
<p class="paywall">The action at ExxonMobilâs shareholder meeting was fascinating: the company, which <a class="external-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/2129f666150f70e2c9f6c7c8abe9c069" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://apnews.com/article/2129f666150f70e2c9f6c7c8abe9c069&quot;}">regularly</a> used to make the list of most-admired companies, had been pulling out all stops to defeat the slate of dissident candidates, which was put forward by Engine No. 1, a tiny activist fund based in San Francisco that owns just 0.02 per cent of the companyâs stock, but has insisted that Exxon needs a better answer to the question of how to meet the climate challenge. Exxon has simply insisted on doubling down: its current plan actually calls for increasing oil and gas production in Guyana and the Permian Basin this decade, even though the International Energy Agency last week called for an end to new development of fossil fuels. Observers at the meeting described a long adjournment midmeeting, and meandering answers to questions from the floor, <a class="external-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/activist-hedge-fund-accuses-exxon-delaying-vote-avoid-proxy-fight-loss-2021-05-26/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/activist-hedge-fund-accuses-exxon-delaying-vote-avoid-proxy-fight-loss-2021-05-26/&quot;}">perhaps as an effort</a> to buy time to persuade more shareholders to go the companyâs way. But the effort failed. Notably, efforts by activists to push big investors appear to have paid off: according to sources, BlackRock, the worldâs largest asset manager, <a class="external-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exclusive-blackrock-backs-three-director-nominees-challenging-exxons-board-2021-05-25/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exclusive-blackrock-backs-three-director-nominees-challenging-exxons-board-2021-05-25/&quot;}">backed</a> three of the dissident candidates for the Exxon boar</p>

<p>The major currents in the Atlantic Ocean help control the climate by moving warm surface waters north and south from the equator, with colder deep water pushing back toward the equator from the poles. The presence of that warm surface water plays a key role in moderating the climate in the North Atlantic, giving places like the UK a far more moderate climate than its locationâthe equivalent of northern Ontarioâwould otherwise dictate.</p>
<p>But the temperature differences that drive that flow are expected to fade as our climate continues to warm. A bit over a decade ago, measurements of the currents seemed to be indicating that temperatures were dropping, suggesting that we might be seeing these predictions come to pass. But a few years later, it became clear that there was just too much year-to-year variation for us to tell.</p>
<p>Over time, however, researchers have figured out ways of getting indirect measures of the currents, using material that is influenced by the strengths of the water&#8217;s flow. These measures have now let us look back on the current&#8217;s behavior over the past several centuries. And the results confirm that the strength of the currents has dropped dramatically over the last century.</p>

<p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">One hundred years ago, Congress passed the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, setting up a system in which companies lease public lands to wrest valuable oil and gas from the ground. In the century since, the royalties and rent that those corporations pay to the American people for access have remained essentially unchanged even as the scale of development and profits has grown hugely.</p>
<p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">As senators from different parties, we have our share of policy differences. But we both believe in sticking up for the public interest and the taxpayer. In this case, we agree that oil and gas companies should pay fair market value for the public resources they extract and sell. They arenât doing that now â not even close â and the American public is the big loser.</p>
<p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">Thatâs why we <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.tomudall.senate.gov/news/press-releases/udall-grassley-introduce-bill-to-ensure-taxpayers-get-fair-share-for-public-lands-leasing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced the Fair Returns for Public Lands Act</a> this year to reform the antiquated law that governs royalties and the leasing of public land.</p>
<p class="css-158dogj evys1bk0">The countryâs economy and the oil and gas industries have changed significantly since 1920. Automobiles had just started to replace the horse and buggy, and the oil industry was a relatively new enterprise dominated by the successors of John D. Rockefellerâs Standard Oil. Yet, since then, the federal royalty rate for oil and gas on public lands has remained steady, at a bargain-basement 12.5 percent of the value of whatâs extracted.</p>

<p>From the air it looks like a huge lake, fed by many tributaries, but on the ground it turns out to be a murky expanse of water, in which no fish or algae can survive. The shore is coated with a black crust, so thick you can walk on it. Into this huge, 10 sq km tailings pond nearby factories discharge water loaded with chemicals used to process the 17 most sought after minerals in the world, collectively known as <a class="u-underline" title="" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/27/rare-minerals-global-renewables-industry" data-link-name="in body link">rare earths</a>.</p>
<p>The town of <a class="u-underline" title="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baotou" data-link-name="in body link">Baotou</a>, in Inner Mongolia, is the largest Chinese source of these strategic elements, essential to advanced technology, from smartphones to GPS receivers, but also to wind farms and, above all, electric cars. The minerals are mined at Bayan Obo, 120km farther north, then brought to Baotou for processing.</p>
<p>The concentration of rare earths in the ore is very low, so they must be separated and purified, using hydro-metallurgical techniques and acid baths. <a class="u-underline" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag">China</a> accounts for 97% of global output of these precious substances, with two-thirds produced in Baotou.</p>
<p>The foul waters of the tailings pond contain all sorts of toxic chemicals, but also radioactive elements such as thorium which, if ingested, cause cancers of the pancreas and lungs, and leukaemia. âBefore the factories were built, there were just fields here as far as the eye can see. In the place of this radioactive sludge, there were watermelons, aubergines and tomatoes,â says Li Guirong with a sigh.</p>

<p>In 2013, an 18-month-old boy got sick after playing near a hollow tree in his backyard in a remote West African village. He developed a fever and started vomiting. His stool turned black. Two days later, he died.</p>
<p>Two years and more than 11,000 deaths later, the World Health Organization put out a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/01/15/377517132/14-takeaways-from-the-14-part-who-report-on-ebola">report</a> saying the Ebola outbreak that likely emanated from that hollow tree may have been caused in part by deforestation led by &#8220;foreign mining and timber operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tree the boy played near was infested with insectivorous bats â bats that may have been pushed into the boy&#8217;s village because upward of 80% of their natural habitat had been destroyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you disturb a forest, it actually upsets, if you want, the balance of nature, the balance between pathogens and people,&#8221; says John E. Fa, a professor of biodiversity and human development at Manchester Metropolitan University, who was part of a team of researchers that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14727-9">linked recent forest loss to 25 Ebola outbreaks</a> that have occurred since 1976.</p>
<p>A finding, he says, that showed a strong correlation between recent deforestation and disease outbreaks.</p>

<p>As governments around the globe debate how to respond both to the coronavirus itself and the economic chaos it has unleashed, a theme thatâs come up over and over is how to prioritize what makes it into spending packages. In the United States, right-left fault lines have emerged over the question of bailing out emissions-heavy industries versus <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/156903/golden-opportunity-green-stimulus">a greener stimulus</a>. On Thursday, the Environmental Protection Agency <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/climate/epa-coronavirus-pollution-rules.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">announced</a> a large-scale rollback of environmental regulations as a response to the pandemicâallowing many emitters to police themselves when it comes to pollution.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615338/coronavirus-emissions-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">some argue</a> that the oxygen in the climate debate should be taken up by the pandemic instead, the two issues arenât mutually exclusive, experts say. In a warming climate, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/155746/climate-change-already-hurting-kids-health">more diseases are likely to emerge and spread</a>, making climate change action an important part of addressing future health crises. Moreover, the perception that climate change isnât as urgent as other crises may rely on misunderstandings about how climate-related changes will happen. The rate isnât constant: Instead, thereâs reason to believe everything from Arctic melt to Amazon deforestation might experience whatâs known as âtipping points,â where small changes in nature shift into rapid and irreversible damage.</p>
<p>Greenland and Antarctica are melting six times faster than they were in the 1990s, according to a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/greenland-antarctica-melting-six-times-faster-than-in-the-1990s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">new study</a> in the journal <i>Nature.</i> Between 1992 and 2017, Greenland and Antarctica lost 6.4 trillion tons of ice. This falls under the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/chapter/summary-for-policymakers/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">worst-case scenario</a> projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the effects are already being felt in many parts of the world. The IPCC predicts that by the end of the century, 400 million people around the globe could be at risk of coastal flooding every year from sea-level rise alone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Does that mean they will stop the Blackouts after the winds reach 40 miles an hour? Does that mean they will go out of business? Or does that mean they will become a nice reasonable caring utility company committed to the community of central California? I got my doubts about the last but we shall see in a year for sure.</p>

<p>In a federal filing Monday permanently documenting its role in causing Californiaâs deadliest wildfire, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric announced it has pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter for the 2018 Camp fire in the Northern California town of Paradise.</p>
<p>PG&amp;E, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said it reached the settlement with the Butte County district attorneyâs office on March 17. Under the deal, PG&amp;E said prosecutors wonât pursue further criminal charges, an outcome that disappointed some utility watchdogs.</p>
<p>This is the second time PG&amp;Eâs guilt has been established in a wildfire legal proceeding. In 1997, a Nevada County jury <a class="Link" href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/PG-E-Guilty-In-1994-Sierra-Blaze-739-counts-of-2821364.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found the utility guilty of causing a fire</a> three years earlier that burned a dozen homes.</p>
<p>But while this chapter of PG&amp;Eâs role in the Camp fire is over, the pleaâs implications for other utilities is less clear, said Shon Hiatt, an associate professor of management and organization at USCâs Marshall School of Business.</p>
