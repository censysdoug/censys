										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the shell game for the oil companies was always &#8211; who can we get to take this stuff? Meaning solid supposedly recyclable plastics. For awhile anybody would take the &#8220;stuff&#8221; to burn it and Americans are like &#8211; out of sight out of mind. When they got caught at that, then they started exporting for &#8220;conversion&#8221; to other substances and China bought that one big time. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, plastic can be recycled but it is MORE expensive to do so than to throw it away. PLUS you can only recycle it once or twice and then it has to be thrown away anyway. YUP recycling was always a lie. But ain&#8217;t capitalism grand.</p>

<p>Laura Leebrick, a manager at Rogue Disposal &amp; Recycling in southern Oregon, is standing on the end of its landfill watching an avalanche of plastic trash pour out of a semitrailer: containers, bags, packaging, strawberry containers, yogurt cups.</p>
<p>None of this plastic will be turned into new plastic things. All of it is buried.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me that felt like it was a betrayal of the public trust,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I had been lying to people &#8230; unwittingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rogue, like most recycling companies, had been sending plastic trash to China, but when China shut its doors two years ago, Leebrick scoured the U.S. for buyers. She could find only someone who wanted white milk jugs. She sends the soda bottles to the state.</p>
<p>But when Leebrick tried to tell people the truth about burying all the other plastic, she says people didn&#8217;t want to hear it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember the first meeting where I actually told a city council that it was costing more to recycle than it was to dispose of the same material as garbage,&#8221; she says, &#8220;and it was like heresy had been spoken in the room: You&#8217;re lying. This is gold. We take the time to clean it, take the labels off, separate it and put it here. It&#8217;s gold. This is valuable.&#8221;</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and read. Next time you see an empty gallon milk jug. Light it on fire in protest. More next week.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>P.S. Today is recycling day in Riverton and they just took my plastic away. hahahahaa</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While this article is not click bait per se, the first sentence talks about Roosevelt and WWII. You know, the Big One that he used to take over the economy for almost 10 years. Ask yourself, &#8220;Would any USA President use emergency powers OR The War Powers Act to purge the economy of fossil fuels&#8221;? The real answer is a resounding NO. Then he proceeds to discuss a &#8220;PLAN&#8221; that is more of a &#8220;thought experiment&#8221; or a model with some &#8220;results&#8221;.</p>
<p>None-the-less it is entertaining. And to be fair possible. But somebody has got to light a really really really large fire. Every pun intended.</p>

<p class="c-entry-summary p-dek">The US has everything it needs to decarbonize by 2035.</p>
<div class="c-byline"><span class="c-byline-wrapper"> By <span class="c-byline__item"> <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/david-roberts" data-analytics-link="author-name"><span class="c-byline__author-name">David Roberts</span></a><a class="c-byline__twitter-handle" href="https://www.twitter.com/drvox">@drvox</a><a title="" href="mailto:david@vox.com">david@vox.com</a> </span> <span class="c-byline__item"> <time class="c-byline__item" datetime="2020-08-06T14:10:00" data-ui="timestamp"> Aug 6, 2020, 10:10am EDT </time> </span> </span></div>
<p id="ZX9Wor">In the runup to World War II, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt enlisted the entire US economy in an effort to scale up production of war material. All of the country’s resources were bent to the task. In 1939, the US had 1,700 aircraft; in 1945, it had 300,000 military aircraft and 18,500 B–24 bombers.</p>
<p id="uRBvdX">By the time the war was won, the economy was up and humming with a massively expanded workforce (drawing in women and African Americans) and turbocharged productive capacity. Investments made during the war mobilization yielded a robust middle class and decades of sustained, broadly shared prosperity.</p>
<p id="SlrMMD">A similar mobilization will be necessary for the US to decarbonize its economy fast enough to avert the worst of climate change. To do its part in limiting global temperature rise to between <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/10/9/17951924/climate-change-global-warming-un-ipcc-report-takeaways">1.5° and 2° Celsius</a>, the US must reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 at the latest. To achieve this, the full resources of the US economy must be bent toward manufacturing the needed clean-energy technology and infrastructure.</p>
<p id="Fyj2J0">FDR began with two questions. First, he asked not what was politically feasible but <em>what was necessary</em> to win the war. He also asked not how much funding was available in the federal budget but how much productive capacity was available in the economy — <em>what was possible</em>.</p>
<p id="ss5u50">Saul Griffith is trying to answer those same questions on climate change: what is necessary, given the trajectory of global warming, and what is possible, given the resources in the US economy.</p>

<p>It is a Vox long read. So go there and read forever. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chernobyl and Fukushima released a lot of radiation. People died from the severe radiation released just after the accident, but &#8220;mild&#8221; consistent radiation is not dangerous to animals though it may have mild effects on adults and bigger effects on children. But the idea that a major radiation release would create one eyed giant humans or fire breathing dragons like wadzzilla is really remote. The fear of radiation has done some pretty amazing things for the environment, however.</p>

Once thought to be forever uninhabitable, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has become a haven for flora and fauna that prove that life, as they say in <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/49904/20-things-you-might-not-have-known-about-jurassic-park" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Jurassic Park</em></a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/oijEsqT2QKQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finds a way</a>.</p>
<h2 class="body title">1. The Animals of Chernobyl Survived Against All Odds</h2>
<p class="body">The effects of the radioactive explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant on April 26, 1986 devastated the environment. Around the plant and in the nearby city of Pripyat in Ukraine, the Chernobyl disaster’s radiation caused the leaves of thousands of trees to turn a rust color, giving a new name to the surrounding woods—the <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/56235-chernobyl-exclusion-zone-33-years-later-wildlife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Forest</a>. Workers eventually bulldozed and buried the radioactive trees. Squads of Soviet conscripts also were ordered to <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-happened-to-the-dogs-of-chernobyl-the-harrowing-events-of-the-tv-series-are-sadly-true-17928470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shoot</a> any stray animals within the 1000-square-mile Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Though experts today believe parts of the zone will remain unsafe for humans for another <a href="https://www.livescience.com/39961-chernobyl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20,000 years</a>, numerous animal and plant species not only survived, but thrived.</p>
<h2 class="body title">2. Bears and Wolves Outnumber Humans Around the Chernobyl Disaster Site</h2>
<p class="body">While humans are strictly prohibited from living in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, many other species have settled there. Brown bears, wolves, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/33677/canada-lynx-ghost-cat-north" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">lynx</a>, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59248/whats-difference-between-bison-and-buffalo" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">bison</a>, deer, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59461/10-gigantic-facts-about-moose" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">moose</a>, beavers, foxes, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64760/10-resourceful-facts-about-badgers" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">badgers</a>, wild boar, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/70797/12-surprising-facts-about-raccoon-dogs" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">raccoon dogs</a>, and more than 200 species of birds have formed their own ecosystem within the Chernobyl disaster area. Along with the larger animals, a variety of amphibians, fish, worms, and bacteria makes the unpopulated environment their home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A &#8220;multi-post&#8221; that I rarely ever do any more. But this issue is important so first my recommendations, first published on Facebook, and then the facts on the ground.</p>
<p>CWLP IS Doomed</p>
<p>If the members of the City Council of Springfield had any sense at all (and guts/leadership) they would:</p>
<p>1/ Tell IBEW 193 to retrain the workers at Dallman 1 2 and 3 in Solar and Wind<span class="text_exposed_show"><br />
2/ They would close Dallman 1 2 and 3<br />
3/ They would put out a notice for proposals to gasify Dallman<br />
4/ They would take the savings and invest it in renewables<br />
5/ They would ask the County to drop their ridiculous zoning rules for wind farms so we could have a wind farm in Sangamon county</span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>But instead they will live in the 1900s and like Trump demand coal for a fuel source no matter what.</p>
</div>
<p>First the SJ-R</p>

<p>In a much-anticipated report, an energy consulting firm is recommending that City Water, Light and Power retire three of its four coal-fired power generators “as soon as feasible” while offering the utility a roadmap to a less coal-dependent future.</p>
<p>The Energy Authority (TEA), which was retained by the city last year to map out a plan for the utility’s power generation for the next 20 years, released the <a href="https://cwlp.com/IRP.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">84-page “integrated resource plan”</a> on Monday and gave a presentation to members of the Springfield City Council.</p>
<p>The firm recommended that CWLP retire Dallman units 1, 2 and 3 by as early as 2020 after finding that “no scenario economically retained these units.”</p>
<p>The results are not much of a surprise given the age of the units and the current state of the energy market, which has been upended by the rise of natural gas and the increasing affordability of renewable energy. For coal-dependent utilities like CWLP, it has not been easy to keep up.</p>
<p>“One of the things that we’ve been saying for quite some time is that coal-fired units basically can’t compete very well in the market, they’re not competitive in the current market,” said CWLP chief utility engineer Doug Brown. “So this report basically confirms all of that.”</p>
<p>Then the Illinois Times.</p>

<p>How can Springfield’s City Water, Light and Power (CWLP) best provide electrical power to meet the community’s future energy needs? Retiring Dallman Units 1, 2 and 3 coal-fired plants, increasing the use of renewable energy and expanding energy efficiency are some of the recommendations included in a recently released report.</p>
<p>Last year the city hired The Energy Authority (TEA) to develop an Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). Kevin Glake from TEA presented the results of the comprehensive study to the city council on May 6 at a meeting of the Public Utilities Committee. Anyone who uses electricity generated by CWLP or cares about the future of the city’s public utility should be interested in this plan.</p>
<p>Public comments are being accepted now through June 3, and a public open house is scheduled for 5-7 p.m. May 20 at the Lincoln Public Library. More information and the complete plan are available online at https://cwlp.com/IRP.aspx. Comments can be emailed to IRP@cwlp.com or mailed to CWLP General Office, ATTN: CWLP IRP, 800 E. Monroe St., Springfield, 62701.</p>

<p>t’s not a welcome message in council chambers.</p>
<p>“They came back with exactly what everyone on the city council knows,” Ward 1 Ald. Chuck Redpath declared at a May 28 committee-of-the-whole meeting, joining colleagues in criticizing the report issued by The Energy Authority. “The point is, we can’t just…go down without a fight. We’re talking about getting rid of two, maybe three, of our plants, and it’s going to be detrimental to our ratepayers. It’s going to be detrimental because, eventually, you are going to have to go out on the net, and buy off the net – the grid – and then we’re going to be subjected to whatever prices we get stuck with if we’re down to one plant. We’ve got to start thinking outside the box and find a better way.”</p>
<p>And so Redpath and other aldermen cling to coal, even as they talk about new courses. Those opposed to coal have a simple response to complaints about a report that contains no surprises.</p>
<p>“They’re not learning anything new because nothing has changed in six years in terms of the economics of those old units,” says Andy Knott, senior campaign representative for the Sierra Club. “They don’t want to look at the facts and the reality and make the best decisions for the ratepayers.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><b>“They’re too old”</b></span></p>
<p>“Integrated resource plan,” a tag invented in the 1980s, is the official title of the study that’s drawing ire from aldermen. The planning process is supposed to help utilities figure out long-term economics. Thirty-three states, but not Illinois, require utilities to prepare IRPs that are subject to review by state regulators.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago Pennsylvania officials were presented a plan to detonate a nuclear device below north-central Pennsylvania. While the project never got past the planning stages it was part of a larger plan to use nuclear bombs in natural gas extraction. (<cite>Pennsylvania State Archives</cite>)</p>

<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This story has been update to fix broken art on this article.</em></p>
<p>HARRISBURG &#8212; In May 1966, Columbia Gas and the federal Atomic Energy Commission presented an audacious plan to a representative of the Governor&#8217;s Science Advisory Committee: A proposal to detonate a nuclear bomb more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima 3,500 feet below north-central Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the present stage, this proposal involves a detonation of a &#8216;shot&#8217; of perhaps 20,000 tons TNT equivalent at a location on the boundary between Centre and Clinton counties,&#8221; wrote Louis Roddis Jr., the governor&#8217;s representative in his report.</p>
<p>The goal was to use the nuclear blast to create a chamber that could then be filled with pressurized natural gas. Named Project Ketch, the proposal was an offshoot of another nuclear explosive-powered idea, Project Gasbuggy, which called on increasing natural gas production by detonating nuclear bombs underground to fracture rock deposits &#8212; nuclear fracking.</p>
<p>From the get-go, however, Roddis noted there would be challenges to the proposal. Safety considerations, he wrote, fell under three categories: seismic problems, immediate radioactivity problems, and long-term radioactivity problems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I thought about posting a story about how cheap alternative energy has become, especially wind power. Much cheaper than coal. I also considered posting a story about how Costa Rico ran its entire country on renewable energy for 300 days or even about the energy plight of Puerto Rico. But I fought against the subsidies for Excelon because the nukes are dangerous boondoggles and because the lost jobs could be replaced with renewal energy jobs. This proves that the State of Illinois wasted 285 million dollars on this crap. I am infuriated.</p>

<p>Radioactive waste continues to pour from Exelon&#8217;s Illinois nuclear power plants more than a decade after the discovery of chronic leaks led to national outrage, a $1.2 million government settlement and a company vow to guard against future accidents, an investigation by a government watchdog group found.</p>
<p>Since 2007, there have been at least 35 reported leaks, spills or other accidental releases in Illinois of water contaminated with radioactive tritium, a byproduct of nuclear power production and a carcinogen at high levels, a Better Government Association review of federal and state records shows.</p>
<p>No fines were issued for the accidents, all of which were self-reported by the company.</p>
<div id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"></div>
<p>The most recent leak of 35,000 gallons occurred over two weeks in May and June at Exelon&#8217;s Braidwood plant, southwest of Chicago. The same facility was the focus of a community panic in the mid-2000s after a series of accidents stirred debate over the safety of aging nuclear plants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is not CES&#8217; stuff. Sure, I am sure the building is energy efficient and well thought out but, I include this post because I saw the movie. I was so impressed. NASA put her in a building with no &#8220;Blacks Only&#8221; bathroom. So every day she would have to spend a half hour or more getting to the bathroom and back. Yet she got our white male astronauts to and from the moon with no complaints. WOW is all I can say. Please read the book and see the movie.</p>

<p>When NASA’s Langley Research Center built its newest, state-of-the-art research facility in Hampton, Va., it was only right that they named it after Katherine Johnson, the NASA engineer and subject of the book and Oscar-nominated film <em>Hidden Figures.</em></p>
<p>“You want my honest answer? I think they’re crazy,” the 99-year-old math genius said when she heard about the naming of the Katherine G. Johnson Computational Research Facility. The building was <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/langley/nasa-langley-s-katherine-johnson-computational-research-facility-officially-opens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dedicated on Sept. 22 </a>in a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe and students from Black Girls Code and the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program.</p>
<div class="js_ad-mobile-dynamic js_ad-dynamic"></div>
<p>The $23 million, 37,000-square-foot data center is named after Johnson, who broke the glass ceiling for black women in the space program. In 2015 Johnson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her work as a trailblazer in the space program.</p>

<p>TALLAHASSEE — The decision by South Carolina utilities to shut down a nuclear plant under construction should send a signal to other states, including Florida, that a supposed nuclear &#8220;renaissance&#8221; is over, critics said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Florida Power &amp; Light Co. proposed building two new nuclear units at its Turkey Point power plant south of Miami, but the utility told the Public Service Commission in May that it plans to continue a planning &#8220;pause&#8221; while it seeks to learn from nuclear plants that were being built in South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>The decision by SCE&amp;G and Santee Cooper utilities to abandon construction in South Carolina nine years after starting shows that the Florida project is doomed, critics said. Duke Energy Florida in 2013 abandoned its plans to build a new nuclear plant in Levy County.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think for FPL and the people of Florida this is a time to say basically, wait a second what are we doing here?&#8221; said Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.</p>

<p>In the late 1970s, a worker at South Carolina&#8217;s Savannah River Site nuclear reservation peered into a seepage basin and spotted a small, out-of-place turtle. Scooping it out of the nuclear waste, the worker toted his new charge to a nearby ecology lab, where he figured they&#8217;d know what to do with it.</p>
<p>As he walked in the lab door, a radioactivity counter began beeping. The lab technician tested the mud on the worker&#8217;s shoes, figuring he&#8217;d tracked in some of the site&#8217;s contaminated muck. When the shoes came up clear, the confused technician tested further. After a few more swipes, the culprit emerged: <a href="http://researchmagazine.uga.edu/92f/nuclear.html">It was the turtle</a>.</p>
<p>Though this was the first radioactive turtle found at the Savannah River Site, it was far from an anomaly—there or elsewhere. Across the world, such creatures scurry, swim and fly among us. Unlike popular representations might lead us believe, most of them lack grotesque deformities, special abilities, or weird proclivities for pizza. Instead, like that turtle, many of them are totally healthy and happy—living relatively normal lives and, unless we try to eat them, posing little direct threat to humans.</p>

<p>Go there and read. It is fascinating. More next week.</p>
