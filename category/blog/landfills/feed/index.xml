										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I say the same thing I have said about recycling all along. Store what you can&#8217;t recycle right now and recycle what you can now. The best examples is the large Wind Generator Blades (it used to be common batteries). Throwing stuff in the land fill that has no business there messes everything else up. So storing the Blades from the Wind Generators (turbines whatever) in one place&#8230;even if you bury them is critical, so that when you find a way to recycle them (and you will) you can go get them. Throwing common batteries in a land fill ( AAs, AAAs, etc) is essentially admitting you will never get them back. Better to store them in abandoned warehouses or something. Even burying them in a battery land fill so you can get them back is better than just throwing them away.</p>

<p>Solar panels are an increasingly important source of renewable power that will play an essential role in fighting climate change. They are also complex pieces of technology that become big, bulky sheets of electronic waste at the end of their lives—and right now, most of the world doesn’t have a plan for dealing with that.</p>
<p>But we’ll need to develop one soon, because the solar e-waste glut is coming. By 2050, the <a class="external-link" href="https://www.irena.org/documentdownloads/publications/irena_ieapvps_end-of-life_solar_pv_panels_2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.irena.org/documentdownloads/publications/irena_ieapvps_end-of-life_solar_pv_panels_2016.pdf&quot;}">International Renewable Energy Agency</a> projects that up to 78 million metric tons of solar panels will have reached the end of their life, and that the world will be generating about 6 million metric tons of new solar e-waste annually. While the latter number is a small fraction of the <a class="external-link" href="http://ewastemonitor.info/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;http://ewastemonitor.info/&quot;}">total e-waste humanity produces</a> each year, standard electronics recycling methods don’t cut it for solar panels. Recovering the most valuable materials from one, including silver and silicon, requires bespoke recycling solutions. And if we fail to develop those solutions along with policies that support their widespread adoption, we already know what will happen.</p>
<p>“If we don’t mandate recycling, many of the modules will go to landfill,” said Arizona State University solar researcher Meng Tao, who recently authored a <a class="external-link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pip.3316" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pip.3316&quot;}">review paper</a> on recycling silicon solar panels, which comprise <a class="external-link" href="https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/ise/de/documents/publications/studies/Photovoltaics-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/content/dam/ise/de/documents/publications/studies/Photovoltaics-Report.pdf&quot;}">95 percent</a> of the solar market.</p>
<p>Solar panels are composed of photovoltaic (PV) cells that convert sunlight to electricity. When these panels enter landfills, valuable resources go to waste. And because solar panels contain toxic materials like lead that <a class="external-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342671383_Metal_dissolution_from_end-of-life_solar_photovoltaics_in_real_landfill_leachate_versus_synthetic_solutions_One-year_study" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342671383_Metal_dissolution_from_end-of-life_solar_photovoltaics_in_real_landfill_leachate_versus_synthetic_solutions_One-year_study&quot;}">can leach out</a> as they break down, landfilling also creates new environmental hazards.</p>

<p>Go there and read. Demand that your municipality pass a law that solar panels do not go in the land fill. More next week.</p>

<p>As cities grow and incomes rise around the world, more and more people are leaving gardens and traditional diets behind and eating refined sugars, refined fats, oils and resource- and land-intense agricultural products like beef. This global dietary transition is harming the health of both people and the planet, says new research.</p>
<p>But the study also shows that shifting away from this trajectory and choosing healthier traditional Mediterranean, pescatarian or vegetarian diets could not only boost human lifespans and quality of life, but also slash emissions and save habitat for endangered species.</p>
<p>And we better hurry; the scientists project that if the trend continues, the situation will be worse yet with greenhouse gas emissions up by 80 percent by 2050.</p>
<p>Examining almost 50 years’ worth of data from the world’s 100 most populous countries, University of Minnesota Professor of Ecology G. David Tilman and graduate student Michael Clark illustrate how current diet trends are contributing to ever-rising agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and habitat degradation.</p>
<p>On top of that, they write: “These dietary shifts are greatly increasing the incidence of Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and other chronic non-communicable diseases that lower global life expectancies.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While this piece is important, it is also kind of cutsie in the fact that all the nuclear waste mentioned is well taken care of. Still I want to make 2 points.</p>
<p>1, I always thought and still do, that Yucca Mountain is a perfect place to store nuclear waste. I was pissed when Obama tried to call the whole thing off and I am glad that the Trump administration is trying to reopen it. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I do not like much of what Trump has done so far BUT this is just fine.</p>
<p>2, Illinois had the perfect opportunity to be the nations nuclear waste dump for real. Northern Illinois between Chicago and the Mississippi River is virtually earthquake free. Like for 1000s of years. As soon as Obama defunded Yucca Mountain we could have stepped up and said, &#8220;We will build it here&#8221;. Illinois could have gotten Billions of Dollars and 100s if not a 1000 jobs, and the waste would have had a very short train trip to disposal. They could have even used trucks. Then it would have been up to the rest of the States to figure out how to get their waste here.  But no, that would have been tooo bold, so now we are back to the beginning.</p>

<h1 class="post-title">Illinois Issues: The Prairie State&#8217;s Nuclear Waste Conundrum</h1>
<div class="by-date"><span class="submitted"><span class="submitted-label">By</span> <span class="name">Kevin McDermott</span></span> <i class="bullet">•</i> <span class="pub-date">Jul 20, 2017 </span></div>
<p><em><strong>The Land of Lincoln is the country&#8217;s largest de facto nuclear waste dump.</strong></em></p>
<p>Under a federal measure passed 30 years ago, the spent fuel from America’s nuclear reactors is supposed to be permanently buried out in the Mojave Desert, tucked deep under a mountain, far from any population center and easily guarded</p>
<p>In reality, though, that radioactive waste – tens of thousands of tons of it – is sitting in temporary storage at dozens of current and former nuclear power sites all over the country, as it has been for decades. The largest portion of it is divided among seven sites that dot the nation’s fifth-largest state: Illinois.</p>
<p>The story of how the Land of Lincoln became the nation&#8217;s biggest de facto nuclear waste dump is a tale of public fear, political pragmatism and the power of NIMBY (<em>Not In My Back Yard</em>).</p>
<p>It’s a story that radiates political irony. Among those responsible for Illinois’ atomic dilemma is the state’s favorite son, Barack Obama, who scuttled a decades-old project that was to have created a national nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and read. Think about it. More next week.</p>

<h1>Resource Recovery Facilities: An Economic And Efficient Energy Supply</h1>

<p>Although the number of U.S. landfills has steadily declined since 1990, the size of landfills has increased. In fact, Americans generated 250 million tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) in 2010 alone. It’s thus no surprise that MSW landfills are our third-largest, human-generated source of methane emissions. But this is more an opportunity than it is a problem.</p>
<p>Many landfills are becoming resource recovery facilities–places where waste or byproducts are reclaimed and converted into energy. Captured by wells installed throughout a landfill, naturally-occurring methane emissions (or landfill gas–LFG) can be converted into <a href="http://www.epa.gov/lmop/basic-info/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple energy sources</a>, including electricity, a replacement for fossil fuels in industrial operations, or upgraded to pipeline-quality gas. Methane’s heat can also be used directly. Of the approximately 2,400 operating or recently closed MSW landfills in the U.S., 535 (around 22 percent) currently have resource recovery projects.</p>
<p>To learn more about these projects and the benefits they deliver, I spoke to several industry experts–including David Specca, Assistant Director for Bioenergy and Controlled Environment Agriculture at <a href="http://ecocomplex.rutgers.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Rutgers University EcoComplex</a>, and Barry Edwards, Director of Engineering and Utilities at <a href="http://www.catawbacountync.gov/ecocomplex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Catawba County</a>–and looked at three examples of successful projects.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I put off starting the annual gardening meditation because I could not believe that on March 20th Winter was really done. Actually we planted some spinach and peas at the beginning of March but we half expected them to die eventually from frost, an ice storm or snow. But now it is pretty clear that global warming is here so what better way to celibrate then to plant potatoes and onion sets. Here is a nifty new wheel barrow.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wagle.com/gardening/containerscarts/flexi-yard-cart-economy-wheel-barrow">http://www.wagle.com/gardening/containerscarts/flexi-yard-cart-economy-wheel-barrow</a></p>
<div>One  of the drawbacks associated with traditional wheelbarrows is time  consuming lifting, shoveling and scooping that takes its toll on your  back. Designed to reduce stress on the upper body and make the arduous  chore of moving yard debris a snap, the innovative Flexi Yard Carts put  the main bucket area on the ground where the load is! Used just like a  dustpan, you can roll, push, or rake all manner of material quickly and  easily while also being able to haul heavy items more efficiently.  Nimble and highly maneuverable, both models feature a lightweight,  collapsible design for compact storage after each use. Features and  Benefits</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Russia not only polluted the Soviet Union like  Chernobyl in Ukraine and and other industrial sites, but they are doing a number on themselves as well. This AP article focuses on their problems with oil, but they have done a number on their part of the Arctic Seas. Their cities are toxic as all get out.</p>

<h1>AP Enterprise: Russia oil spills wreak devastation</h1>
<p>By  NATALIYA VASILYEVA</p>
<p>The Associated Press</p>
<p>USINSK, Russia  — On the bright yellow tundra outside this oil town  near the Arctic Circle, a pitch-black pool of crude stretches toward the  horizon. The source: a decommissioned well whose rusty screws ooze with  oil, viscous like jam</p>
<p>This is the face of Russia&#8217;s oil country, a sprawling, inhospitable  zone that experts say represents the world&#8217;s worst ecological oil  catastrophe.</p>
<p>Environmentalists estimate at least 1 percent of Russia&#8217;s annual oil  production, or 5 million tons, is spilled every year. That is equivalent  to one Deepwater Horizon-scale leak about every two months. Crumbling  infrastructure and a harsh climate combine to spell disaster in the  world&#8217;s largest oil producer, responsible for 13 percent of global  output.</p>

<p>This TED article lays out the total picture better.</p>

<h1>TED Case Studies: Russia Air Pollution</h1>
<h1>I. <a name="r1">Identification</a></h1>
<h2>1. The Issue</h2>
<p>The extent of pollution and ecological collapse in  Russia is due to decades of ill-considered military and industrial development undertaken in virtual secrecy and with scant concern for the environmental and health consequences.  Environmental pollution clamps a stranglehold on the big cities in  Russia.  Pollution in  Russia  now threatens the health of millions of citizens and the safety of crops, water and air.  In 84 of  Russia&#8217;s  largest cities the  air pollution  is ten times the accepted safety levels.  In some areas, especially among children, levels of respiratory problems are 50 per cent higher than the national average.  Moreover, Russia is a major contributor to global ozone depletion, being the World&#8217;s largest producers and consumers of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS).  Thus, Russias emphasis on production at all costs has cost this country its environmental integrity.</p>
<p>2. Description</p>
<p>In the former Soviet Union, the government promoted production at all costs for decades.  The strategy for economic growth in the USSR was established in the first Five Year Plan of 1929, and remained fundamentally unchanged for the next 50 years.  At the time of the 1917 revolution, and despite a drive for industrialization in the late 19th century, economic development in Russia had continued to lag well behind that of the major  Europeans countries  and the United Sates.  By the late 1930s, following enormous losses incurred during World War I and the sub- sequent civil war, and part due to the perceptions of an increasing threat of further military conflict, the objective of catching up with the West became the dominant influence on economic policy.  The relatively liberal New Economic Policy of 1921-28 had mixed results and was seen as inadequate to the task of achieving the desired þdash for growth.þ  The new approach, centered of accelerated industrialization, required rapid mobilization of capital, labor and material inputs, with lesser emphasis being placed in their efficient use (so-called extensive development).  The introduction of a full scale command economy-including nationalization of almost the entire capital stock and collectivization of agriculture-was seen as the only way to achieve these shifts in resources at the required pace.</p>
<p>As far as natural resources were concerned, there had been a tendency to exploit the more accessible reserves first.  Cost of extraction and transportation therefore rose as production (of oil and gas in particular) was forced to shift from Europe and Central Asia to harsher and more remote regions in Siberia and the Far East.  At the same time, the incentives for enterprise managers to innovate, increase efficiency or improve the quality of their output were inadequate or even perverse.  The planning system motivated higher production primarily by imposing increasingly ambitious targets since it could not afford to allow temporarily lower output from one enterprise to jeopardize the input s to others.  Thus the infrastructure and environment were further causalities of the preoccupation with growth and meeting the yearly plan objectives.  Risks of environmental damage were not allowed to obstruct the resource requirements of rapid industrialization, and would eventually impose enormous costs on the Soviet economy.</p>
