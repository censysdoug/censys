										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been at a loss for words for the last month. Things are going so well. I know Dotard is still President and many things are seriously messed up. But on the alternative energy front things just keep getting better and better. Don Blankenship actually made a fool out of himself and lost a primary vote for the Senate in West Virginia. Next week I may even get to report that Yucca Mountain is open for business. But for now, California hits one out of the park.</p>

<p data-page="1">California regulators on Wednesday mandated that all newly built single family houses have solar panels, part of the state&#8217;s aggressive push to combat climate change.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card collection-item" data-type="text">
<div class=" card-content ">
<p>The California Energy Commission voted 5-0 to approve the measure, which also applies to multifamily buildings of three stories or fewer. The mandate is set to take effect in 2020 and does not need the approval of the Legislature.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card collection-item" data-type="text">
<div class=" card-content ">
<p>The requirement is expected to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-solar-panels-homes-20180508-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">save consumers</a> money in the long run through reduced utility bills, but also make a new house more expensive to purchase at a time many families already struggle to afford a mortgage.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="card collection-item" data-type="text">
<div class=" card-content ">
<p>In addition to the solar mandate, the commission approved new insulation and air filter requirements for newly built homes. In all, the new residential requirements are expected to make a single-family house $9,500 more expensive to build on average, but save $19,000 in reduced utility bills over a 30-year period, according to the Energy Commission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am a graduate of Sangamon State University. What is now University of Illinois Springfield. They just build a Student Union and I am so proud of it. It could be LEED certified and it is student centered. Our Student Union was in a temporary building 0n the temporary campus &#8220;down the hill&#8221;. This is just so cool.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rGKhFojmcy"><p><a href="https://www.uis.edu/advancement/choose/student-union/strategic-design/">Strategic Design of the UIS Student Union</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://www.uis.edu/advancement/choose/student-union/strategic-design/embed/#?secret=rGKhFojmcy" data-secret="rGKhFojmcy" width="584" height="329" title="&#8220;Strategic Design of the UIS Student Union&#8221; &#8212; Office of Advancement" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>This is the part I like:</p>
<h3>Environmentally Excellent</h3>
<p>UIS is seeking a LEED Gold certificate (Leadership in Energy &amp; Environmental Design, awarded by the U.S. Green Building Council), both for the sake of the environment and in order to take advantage of energy saving measures. For this reason, the building will have a green, or “living,” roof with vegetation and a growing medium over a sloped membrane. This roof will provide insulation, help to lower air temperatures, and last much longer than other roofs—50 to 60 years rather than the 20 to 30 years most roofs last. The vegetation will most likely include wildflowers that will change throughout the growing season, adding to the building’s beauty.</p>
<p>To reduce storm runoff and eliminate water irrigation, the Student Union will have a rainwater reclamation system that takes advantage of the roof’s slope. Also in consideration of LEED approvals, lighting will be designed to meet the USGBC’s very stringent requirements.</p>

<p>Go there and read. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I agreed to publish this here because it is such a different perspective then the one I have or CES has. We tend to blame builders for not just serving up top notch energy efficient residences. Then there is the issue of retrofitting. As always this is no endorsement of Ryan or his Real Estate firm. Believe me I have no intention of buying a home in Alaska.</p>

More buyers see the value of it, and more builders and sellers are starting to make changes in that direction. There is still a long way to go before energy efficiency and reducing waste becomes the standard for new homes and improved existing homes, but a larger pool of buyers demanding these features can help move the needle bit by bit.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To Not talk about how disastrous Trump&#8217;s Presidency will be for the environment and the energy industry I decided to return to my roots in the residential market. Todays article is a bit old but its message is timeless. We have been concentrating on single devices like furnaces, refrigerators, windows seen as a whole instead of a holistic approach to a house.</p>

<h1 class="article-page-heading">We’re Doing Residential Energy Efficiency All Wrong</h1>
<div class="img-desc hidden-xs">
<p>Nate Adams says radical changes are needed in the home-performance business.</p>
<div class="meta"><span class="by-info">by Nate Adams<br />
September 08, 2015 </span></div>
</div>
<p>Utilities are now spending nearly <a href="http://sheltongrp.com/7-billion-later/">$7 billion a year</a> on energy-efficiency programs. It seems we have little to show for it aside from expensive consultants who will model any results you would like.</p>
<p>These programs tend to focus their marketing on the energy savings or money savings from the projects. Consumers don’t care. If they did, we would see geometric growth instead of a resounding &#8220;meh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others focus on better financing products, slicker sales pitches, faster energy audits, higher rebates or any of a myriad of other things.</p>
<p>In the residential sector, none of these are the problem. The lack of sales is the problem.</p>
<p>Projects are not being sold and implemented in substantial numbers. We need to slow it down, build relationships with consumers and educate them, learn and think systemically about the problems they have, and arrive at solutions that fit homeowner budgets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As UN climate negotiators gather in Geneva this week, one Japan-inspired Hungarian inventor believes he has found a revolutionary and inexpensive way to construct buildings that could slash humanity&#8217;s energy needs.</p>
<p>And the magic ingredient for Matyas Gutai&#8217;s invention is simple: water. It was launched after a long process of testing and patenting and a decade of research and development at a Japanese university.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine a building without insulation, yet with a perfect indoor thermal balance, thanks to the properties of water,&#8221; the 34-year-old told AFP.</p>

<h1>Build a Water-Wall Home</h1>
<p><em> Construct your very own water-wall home and learn about calculating water storage requirements, wall construction and solar basics. </em></p>
<div class="HeaderControl">By David Bainbridge<br />
November/December 1983</div>
<p>The Morgan home in Davis, California has 14,000 pounds of thermal mass stored in its water walls, yet the containers blend in so well with the house design that they&#8217;re barely visible.</p>
<p>In many ways, <em>passive</em> solar homes are superior to those with <em>active</em> (mechanically assisted) heating and cooling systems. After all, passive solar systems don&#8217;t rely on auxiliary energy sources to perform (so they&#8217;ll work even when the power is off)&#8230; are generally simple and low in cost, combine energy collection and storage functions, have a long life, need little maintenance, and can often be built and installed by the home handy person, without special training or equipment.</p>
<p>But precisely because such &#8220;non-moving&#8221; systems have no pumps or controls to circulate warm or cool air, they typically rely on one key element: the <em>thermal mass</em> that stores and gives off absorbed heat or cold. A number of different items can be used to provide this energy-holding capacity, but just about the most effective and economical &#8220;To a water wall (a term that is a shorthand way of saying &#8220;contained water for thermal mass in passive solar homes&#8221;).</p>

<p><a name="22"></a>22.    What is the difference between a mass wall and a basement wall, and what are the insulation requirements for both?</p>
<p>A mass wall is a heavy wall that is more than half above grade wall and is constructed of a fairly massive material (e.g., concrete, block, insulated concrete forms, masonry cavity, non-veneered brick , adobe, compressed block, rammed earth, and solid logs). A basement wall is a wall that is more than half below grade and encloses conditioned space. Insulation requirements for basement walls and mass walls depend on the location of the insulation and the type of insulation (whether it is continuous or insulation installed in a cavity). Requirements also vary by climate zone. Below is a table detailing the insulation requirements in the energy code.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes I know there are many things that are wrong about Las Vegas. People shouldn&#8217;t even be there in the first place. The rape of the river that no longer reaches the sea. The rape of the pristine desert and the death of many Native Americans. I lived there for a year and there is also the cheesy nature of the culture. But when they do something right, you got to give them credit.</p>

<h1>Nevada Energy Star Partners Demonstrate Peak Performance (Web Only)</h1>
<div>BY <a href="http://www.homeenergy.org/list/author/id/946">ANNETTE BUBAK</a></div>
<div>September 01, 2012</div>
<p>Las Vegas may appear balmy and inviting with its sparkling pools and  swaying palm trees, but those who live in Neon City know the truth: It’s  too cold in the winter and too hot in the summer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, hundreds of thousands of homes that were built during  an amazing 50 years of rapid growth in the Southwest do not incorporate  modern advances in energy performance to accommodate the wild swings of  desert climate. As temperatures climb to 110°F in the summer, many homes  leak large amounts of cooled air through gaps in ducts, roofs, windows,  and doors. And when the frigid north wind drops the temperature below  freezing in the winter, heated air escapes, leaving living rooms and  bedrooms uncomfortably cold and drafty. While Las Vegans know their  climate, they may not realize that they are paying to heat and cool the  great outdoors.</p>
<p>The dramatic temperature shifts in the high-desert climate make Las  Vegas an ideal place for homeowners who are looking to make their homes  more comfortable and to save substantially on their energy bills. Funded  in part by DOE’s Building America program, the Building America  Retrofit Alliance is working with the Nevada ENERGY STAR Partners–Green  Alliance (NESP–Green Alliance), and with Better Building Performance, a  Las Vegas company, to upgrade two typical homes top to bottom.

<p><a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/buildings-without-air-conditioners-the-latest-in-energy-efficiency-5413/">http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/buildings-without-air-conditioners-the-latest-in-energy-efficiency-5413/</a></p>
<h1>Buildings Without Air Conditioners: The Latest in Energy Efficiency</h1>
<h3>Air conditioners consume an inordinate amount of power in  the U.S. and they aren&#8217;t very efficiently used. To save energy, some say  leave them out.</h3>
<h6>Michael Kanellos: December 22, 2008</h6>
<p>Sometimes the most efficient air conditioning system is not having one at all.</p>
<p>To curb energy consumption, architects with projects in  temperate cities – Seattle, Portland, San Francisco – have started to  design buildings without mechanical air conditioners. These buildings  will have heaters in all likelihood, but not air conditioning (see <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/can-greentech-make-housing-cheaper-921.html">Can Greentech Make Housing Cheaper</a> and <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/green-buildings-no-subsidies-needed--916.html">Green Buildings No Subsidies Needed</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;There are only five days a year you need cooling in  Seattle,&#8221; said Amanda Sturgeon, an architect and senior associate at the  firm <a href="http://www.perkinswill.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perkins + Will</a>, who recently designed a building without a mechanical conditioner.</p>
<p>In some cases, architects are putting in air-side  economizers, i.e., computer-controlled windows that open to let in  cooling breezes (see <a href="http://multimedia.greentechmedia.com/video/photosolar/" target="_self" rel="noopener">The Solar Window</a>).  The General Services Administration building in San Francisco uses  openable windows on 12 of its 18 floors that let in cool breezes at  night that, ideally, keep the offices cool in the daytime.  There is no  mechanical cooling in the open office areas.</p>
<p>This shift comes courtesy of two trends. One, building  developers and contractors have latched onto green buildings as an  economic opportunity. Designing a building to LEED Silver or Gold  standards – the environmental building standards promulgated by the <a href="http://www.usgbc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Green Building Council</a> –  only adds around 2 percent to the overall cost or less, according to  various contractors, architects and researchers. Designing to the LEED  Platinum standard can add only 6 percent if carefully planned. The  trick, say Sturgeon and others, is to exploit as many passive,  design-centric techniques for scoring LEED points before moving on to  the potentially more expensive, equipment-centric ones like biomass  boilers or new types of lighting systems.</p>
