										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More next Fall. HAHA Took me three extra months to return. Sorry did not EVEN think about posting until now.</p>
<p>First, of let me say I am now cancer free. Second, let me say that taking a break away from posting because of the cancer and the cancer treatment left me fairly lazy, so it is tough getting back to writing these posts. The thought has occurred to me that I might retire at the end of the year. Anyway it is good to be back for now. So without further adieu:</p>

<p class="Component-root-0-2-63 p Component-p-0-2-54">FELDHEIM, Germany (AP) — Europeans are opening their energy bills with trepidation these days, bracing for hefty price hikes as utility companies pass on the <a class="paragraph-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-germany-prices-financial-crisis-deba9cb23f28e645e7349256126eaae6">surging cost of natural gas</a>, oil and electricity tied to Russia’s war in Ukraine. <a class="paragraph-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-germany-prices-cca7e5afd38fbcfc1ad72934e8e59bd9?utm_source=homepage&amp;utm_medium=TopNews&amp;utm_campaign=position_03">Many are trying to conserve</a> by turning down the heat and shutting off lights this winter.</p>

<p class="Component-root-0-2-63 p Component-p-0-2-54">Located about an hour and a half south of Berlin, this modest but well-kept village has been energy self-sufficient for more than a decade.</p>
<p class="Component-root-0-2-63 p Component-p-0-2-54">A bold experiment launched in the mid-1990s saw Feldheim erect a handful of wind turbines to provide electricity to the village. Then it built a local grid, solar panels, battery storage and more turbines.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can the Grid run only on Alternative Power? Yes. Can we store enough Alternative Energy to run the Grid smoothly (night and day, whenever)? Yes. Can we turn Alternative Power off if we need to? This video argues, Yes. Again, I do not normally do videos because this is a print based blog. But this video says it better than any article I have ever seen. So:</p>

<p>The buildings we live and work in have to meet a wide range of needs, whether it’s an office block in the middle of the city or a small house in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Think of a building’s temperature: It can be regulated by radiators, fans and air conditioning systems, while basic actions such as opening and closing a window or door can also be effective. Today, smart technology allows many of these appliances to be controlled remotely using smartphones.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You only need to look at your monthly utility bill to know that living in a building — be it large or small — costs money.</p>
<p>The impact of buildings on the environment is also a concern. According to the IEA, final energy use in buildings hit approximately 3,060 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2018, up from 2,820 Mtoe in 2010.</p>
<p>Fossil fuels’ share in buildings’ energy use was at 36% in 2018, the IEA says, a small drop compared to 38% in 2010.</p>

<p>I didn’t feel good about asking Greta Thunberg for an interview. She’s a kid still; stardom rots the soul; and the spotlight is clearly torture to her—a torture she has chosen freely, but a torture all the same. And her celebrity has never seemed entirely healthy: this Nordic child, from one of the most comfortable and privileged societies the Earth has ever known, leading a movement to confront a planetary crisis that disproportionately harms people who do not look anything like her—people who live in Mozambique, the Bahamas, Somalia, San Juan, whose lives could not be more different from hers. Wasn’t the media playing the same tired, old game, elevating a photogenic white savior figure so that it wouldn’t have to deal with voices and faces that might make it uncomfortable? And wasn’t I part of that media?</p>

<p>But I was also on my way to Madrid to cover December’s United Nations climate summit, and it was sufficiently important to Thunberg to be heard there that she <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964670/greta-thunberg-boat-madrid-youtube-family" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sailed</a> across the Atlantic <i>twice</i>. It felt irresponsible not to try to interview her, if only to ask her the same questions I was asking myself. Plus, she and the other youth activists would be the more lively subjects in those windowless convention center halls. Without their idealism and anger, the event would look like just another bureaucratic <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/madrid-climate-summit-cop25/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">death march</a>.</p>
<p>I found an email address for interview requests. Greta wasn’t even on land yet at that point, but she had internet on the catamaran. She was tweeting still, and occasionally posting <a href="https://twitter.com/gretathunberg/status/1196101877152256001?s=21" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">selfies</a>. I couldn’t help but notice that out there in the swells and spray, she looked much happier and more at ease than she had on any of the stages I had seen her on over the previous month, each day looking more and more exhausted. Every time I saw her happy, I realized, I felt happy too. But this was part of the problem, wasn’t it? That I—and I knew I wasn’t alone in this—had become so invested in her individual happiness; that I had managed to funnel a portion of my rising panic over the climate crisis into her, brave little Greta, with the fierce eyes and the stainless steel backbone, those earnest pigtails a reminder that she was, despite it all, a child.</p>

<div>
<p>India is all set to cross the 100GW renewable energy capacity mark in 2020 and can make rapid strides towards the ambitious 175GW clean energy target by 2022 provided the government keeps a close eye on key issues and deals with those well in time.</p>
<p>The government however needs to promote storage to ensure 24X7 clean energy supply as coal fired thermal power still remains the base load in the country.</p>
<p>Presently, the issues hampering growth of renewables in India are lack of</p>

<p>interest of financial institution to fund renewable energy projects, safeguard duty on imported solar panels, ambiguity over goods and services tax (GST) on solar equipment and low investor sentiment due to delayed or non-payment by discoms to clean energy developers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is one thing for Germans in power to say they are giving up using coal. It is another thing to do it. It is another thing to get people to go along with it. I saw nothing about massive retraining programs or massive building projects but still I have always said &#8220;Green is Good for the economy&#8221;. We shall see if that is true. I say HURRAY.</p>

<h1>AP Explains: How Germany hopes to quit using coal</h1>
</div>
<div class="signature"><span class="byline">By FRANK JORDANS </span><span class="Timestamp">January 25, 2019</span></div>
<p>BERLIN (AP) — Germany wants to stop using coal, a major source of the carbon emissions that drive climate change. But finding the least disruptive way to get there has been a challenge.</p>
<p>A big question is not only when the last mines and power plants will close down, but how quitting coal can be done without generating drawn-out protests or harming the German economy.</p>
<p>A government-appointed panel of experts is poised to offer recommendations. Despite months of deliberations, the panel remained undecided on key issues ahead of a <a href="https://www.apnews.com/adb33aaf31724a9b8b8e7cd5702ff3d2">key meeting on Friday</a> .  A short guide to the stakes at play and some proposed solutions:</p>

<div id="google_ads_iframe_15786418/APNews/site/article/midarticle1_0__container__">
<p>WHY IS GERMANY QUITTING COAL?</p>
<p>Germany is committed to the 2015 Paris climate accord, an international agreement that set a goal of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F), ideally 1.5 C (2.7 F).</p>
<p>Achieving the goal will require steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Germany’s coal plants produce the most carbon dioxide of any country in Europe, and forecasts indicate the country will <a href="https://www.apnews.com/74399f351e2e438ea2c584328087942a">miss its 2020 target</a> for reducing emissions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In all fairness the headline should read TRYS to clean ocean. Why do I even cover this story? Well plastic is a really really energy intensive industry. Second we made a big point of the Dutch Boy&#8217;s attempt to clean up the north Pacific Gyre. So it is only far to point out when industry is trying too. Though to be fair Sparkling Water tackled a much smaller  (some would say manageable) problem.</p>

<p><b><i>CEO Daniel Birnbaum Leads 300 SodaStream Executives from Around the World, Local Youth and Environmental NGOs to Clean Caribbean Sea and Roatán Shores</i></b></p>
<p>AIRPORT CITY, <span class="xn-location">Israel</span>, <span class="xn-chron">Oct. 15, 2018</span> /PRNewswire/ &#8212; SodaStream International Ltd. (NASDAQ: <a href="http://studio-5.financialcontent.com/prnews?Page=Quote&amp;Ticker=SODA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SODA</a>) today announced the launch of the &#8220;Holy Turtle&#8221; &#8211; a massive ocean contraption designed to clean plastic waste from open waters. The innovative device will be initially piloted today in the Caribbean Sea, off the coast of Roatán, <span class="xn-location">Honduras</span>, as part of a bold ocean clean-up lead by CEO <span class="xn-person">Daniel Birnbaum</span>. This is the first-known attempt of a commercial company to undertake a physical clean-up of trash from open waters. SodaStream&#8217;s clean-up delegation includes 150 SodaStream executives from 45 countries, international environmental specialists, NGO Plastic Soup Foundation and hundreds of children from 7 different local schools with local Honduran government officials.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1">
<p>The &#8220;Holy Turtle&#8221; is a 1,000 ft. long floating unit designed to be gently towed by two marine vessels along kilometers of open waters. The contraption is uniquely engineered to capture floating waste while its large vent holes act to protect wildlife. The device design was inspired by oil spill containment systems and was developed by ABBCO in <span class="xn-location">Florida, USA</span>, who are leading experts in oil spill containment.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1">
<p>SodaStream&#8217;s Roatán initiative was inspired by a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-41866046/the-giant-mass-of-plastic-waste-taking-over-the-caribbean" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">video</a> filmed by <span class="xn-person">Caroline Powers</span> in <span class="xn-chron">October 2017</span> featured on BBC highlighting underwater photography of a floating trash patch off the <span class="xn-location">Caribbean</span> coast of Roatán. Moved by the disturbing video, SodaStream CEO, <span class="xn-person">Daniel Birnbaum</span>, himself an experienced skipper and naval officer, lead a search for a solution to clean up this floating waste. Birnbaum noted, &#8220;We can&#8217;t clean up all the plastic waste on the planet, but we each need to do whatever we can. The most important thing is to commit ourselves to stop using single-use plastic.&#8221;</p>

I know this is kind of the back water from the Russian and the European efforts. Yes &#8211; God knows what China is doing. They have their own tokamak but they do not publish much about it.

The device, a magnetic-confinement fusion reactor named for the sun, was shoved to the side after Soviet scientists revealed their tokamak design to the world in 1968. The tokamak has been the preferred design for fusion reactors ever since, but the stellarator might be making a comeback.</p>
<p class="body-text">German scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) built a stellarator called the Wendelstein 7-X that was <a class="body-link" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a17918/wendelstein-7-x-nuclear-reactor-finished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched on for the first time in 2015</a>. Previous tests pushed the plasma in the reactor to higher temperatures and densities than ever before achieved in a stellarator, and now the IPP reports that it has broken its old records in a new test with upgraded components on the Wendelstein 7-X.</p>
<p class="body-text">A stellarator is similar to a tokamak in that both devices use large superconducting magnets to suspend hydrogen plasma and heat it to the temperatures and pressures required to fuse the material into helium. (The Wendelstein 7-X consists of 50 superconducting magnet coils about 3.5 meters high.) The stellarator, however, traps the plasma in a twisting and spiraling shape, rather than the <a class="body-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">torus</a> (doughnut shape) of a tokamak. The twisting path of a stellarator is designed to cancel out instabilities present in the suspended hydrogen plasma.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This method of generation will only go up from here. But here is something most people don&#8217;t consider, at sea drilling for oil and wind farms are incompatible. You can not drill anywhere near wind turbines because of the possibility of oil spills. There is a good chance those spills would ignite. That is not the case with other spills or even explosions and fires. Because they are easily put out. But when you have an electrical source, those fires are guaranteed and would be difficult to extinguish. So all you have to do to stop off shore drilling is build wind farms. Mark my words, when some hotshot wind person builds a wind farm over a proven oil deposit, oil is dead.</p>

<h1 class="article__title">After an Uncertain Start, U.S. Offshore Wind Is Powering Up</h1>
<div class="article__dek">
<p>After years of delays, the U.S. offshore wind industry is finally gaining momentum, with new projects being planned along the Atlantic coast. So far, the Trump administration seems to be regarding offshore wind as one form of renewable energy it can support.</p>

<h5>This summer, the Norwegian energy company, <a href="https://www.statoil.com/">Statoil</a>, will send a vessel to survey a triangular slice of federal waters about 15 miles south of Long Island, where the company is planning to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/statoil-names-new-york-offshore-wind-project-empire-wind-300542071.html">construct a wind farm</a> that could generate up to 1.5 gigawatts of electricity for New York City and Long Island — enough to power roughly 1 million homes. Construction on the “Empire Wind” project, with scores of wind turbines generating electricity across 79,000 acres of leased federal waters, is scheduled to begin in 2023, with construction completed in 2025.</h5>
<p>Farther south, 27 miles off the coast of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, <a href="http://www.avangridrenewables.us/">Avangrid Renewables</a>, an Oregon-based company, has already begun planning for a major wind energy farm on 122,000 acres of federal waters, a project that could eventually generate 1.5 gigawatts of electricity.</p>
<p>And about 10 miles off the New Jersey coast, between Atlantic City and Cape May, Danish clean-energy giant <a href="https://orsted.com/en">Ørsted</a>, which has a large portfolio of offshore wind farms across Europe, <a href="http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/breaking/atlantic-city-offshore-wind-developer-all-in-on-green-energy/article_c6e911e9-de6c-5d4e-8a55-525295ce6f03.html">is talking</a> with local officials, securing state permits, and doing seafloor surveys on a 160,000-acre site, where it plans to build its 1–gigawatt <a href="http://oceanwind.com/en/About-Ocean-wind">Ocean Wind</a> project. Company officials say they are hopeful that the wind farm will come online between 2020 and 2025.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia has a plan to wean its economy off oil. In the biggest sign of what the future of the Gulf state would look like, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, has signed a memorandum of understanding with Japanese multinational Softbank to build 200 GW of solar power by 2030 at a cost of $200 billion.</p>
<p>These are eye-popping numbers. If built, that solar-power plant will be about 200 times the size of the biggest solar plant operating today. It would more than triple Saudi Arabia’s capacity to produce electricity, from about 77 GW today.</p>
<p>With current technology, solar panels capable of generating 200 GW would likely cover 5,000 sq km—an area larger than the the world’s largest cities.</p>
