										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know it has been awhile since I did a residential post. I know this started out as a blog about residential energy needs and services. You know, energy efficient roofs, HVAC equipment and other such stuff. But years ago, I got off on energy related environmental stuff and then eventually Global Warming. Then anti-Nuclear stuff. Finally just raw Environmental stuff like obnoxious polluting and horrible deaths. Well today a gentleman named Chris Winters reached out and touched me so I am touching him back, so to speak. As always, I can vouch for his tips because they are somewhat general, but anything specific he is pitching I can not (For instance AC controllers &#8211; which his company sells). Also I may have put up this as an addenda to any earlier piece, so if i did forgive me.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cielowigle.com/blog/energy-saving-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.cielowigle.com/blog/energy-saving-tips/</a></p>
<p>No matter what the season, energy usage tends to increase one way or another. With long running air conditioning and increased wash cycles of sweaty laundry in summer, to high heating usage and wash cycles of bulkier laundry in winter, we simply cannot operate without electricity.</p>
<p>We can be extremely energy efficient and follow energy saving tips and tricks to ingrain some environmentally friendly habits.</p>
<p>Following energy saving tips is essential to lower your costs, but it is also important to decrease your ecological footprint.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/2020/08/generation-green-is-leading-the-sustainability-agenda/">millennials and Gen Z nicknamed “generation green”</a>, there is a strong focus on energy saving, and rightly so. However, global warming is rising more rapidly than ever, and the term ‘climate emergency’ is being used rather than climate change to highlight the situation’s intensity.</p>
<p>All industries such as <a href="https://www.cielowigle.com/blog/climate-change/">HVAC are revolutionizing their technology to act on climate change</a>. Since home appliances and devices are a major contributor to our energy consumption, utilizing smart devices such as smart thermostats or <a href="https://www.cielowigle.com/">smart controllers for air conditioners</a> can make a huge difference on your bills!</p>
<p>Let’s get right to it. Here are 21 energy saving tips that can easily help you decrease your energy consumption:</p>
<h2 id="h-1-use-energy-efficient-appliances">1. Use Energy Efficient Appliances</h2>
<p>Energy efficient appliances are specially designed to consume minimum energy to complete the same tasks that you’d perform with normal appliances.  In addition, some</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every once in awhile I return to CES&#8217; residential roots. So, here is another pass. You know what I say in these situations &#8211; Buyer Beware. This site looks really really good. I think it is sexy that it is a nonprofit organization. But I have never used this organization. I am a homeowner who has made very little in the way of energy IMPROVEments &#8211; insulation, metal roof and efficient air conditioner but the furnace in my house is 20 years old. Nonetheless these people look cool.</p>
<p><a href="https://zeroenergyproject.org/our-mission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://zeroenergyproject.org/our-mission/</a></p>
<p><strong>The Zero Energy Project is a non-profit educational organization whose goal is to help home buyers, builders, designers, and real estate professionals take meaningful steps</strong> towards radically reducing carbon emissions and energy bills by building zero net energy homes and near zero energy homes. We envision the day when positive energy homes, which produce more energy than they consume, will power electric vehicles as well as homes, so that everyone can live well with less expense and without fear of energy price spikes, while greatly reducing our carbon emissions.</p>
<div id="" class="col-sm-12 full-standard nobg slate cover">
<div class=" withtitle">
<div class="content withtitle">
<div class="singlecolumn">
<h3>The mission of the Zero Energy Project is to provide information and education to prospective home buyers, builders, designers, real estate professionals and advocates about zero net energy homes and to advance the prevalence of these homes in the mainstream housing market. We seek to facilitate connections between industry professionals and buyers, remove perceived barriers to entry, and provide resources to people from all walks of life, empowering action towards a robust zero energy built environment.</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>And Tomorrow never comes. Yep, it is just like Flying Cars and all those other thing you saw on the Jetson&#8217;s and still haven&#8217;t happened yet. Why because the Power Structure doesn&#8217;t want them to happen. Imagine if you will &#8211; electricity is like a crude spear made of rock and a stick. Nuclear Power is the pointy rock on tip of the spear and society is a human body. That spear is plunged in to the human body NOT so that it dies, but so it heals. Now whoever controls the shaft of that spear controls the human. THAT is the way the power grid was DESIGNED. To change power grids you have to pull the spear out. The human dies.</p>

<p id="jyKEUO" class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text drop-letter-i"><span role="text"><span class="sr-only">In</span></span> the future, our vehicles and homes will be in constant conversation with the power grid. Smart thermostats will send information about how much energy the home is using or potentially wasting to heat or cool itself. Solar panels will say how much energy they have on hand, while electric vehicles will share information about when and where they’re charging and how much juice they need for their travels. Solar and EV batteries might even offer up the energy they’re storing in case it’s needed elsewhere.</p>
<p id="dcseeR">“You just plug it in, and somehow it automatically talks to its nearest neighbors,” explains Ben Kroposki, a director at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. “[It] says, ‘Hey, I just want to let you know I’m out here. I can provide these kinds of services back.’”</p>
<p id="a6P4n1">That conversation is the backbone of what’s called a “smart grid.” While America’s aging grid system was built to send electricity in one direction — from power plants to homes and businesses — smart grids are a two-way street. Homes and buildings send information and electricity back to the grid or to other homes and buildings. An electric vehicle battery, for example, might be able to provide power to an area in the middle of a blackout. A smart grid also listens for directions from the utility, so that it charges whenever solar or other renewable energy is most abundant.</p>
<p id="4i0kPH">It’s a simple enough idea that for more than a decade has been sold as a way to improve the efficiency, environmental impact, and resiliency of the power sector. But electricity grids still have a long way to go to get “smart.” They’ve managed to fail spectacularly under the stressors of climate change and more extreme weather.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First off, spell check does not like the word tankless. You would think by now that the people at WORD Press would have gotten over that spelling by now. Second off (to be consistent) this is not and article that CES can defend or debate. It is an article generated by another site so &#8220;Buyer Beware&#8221;. The articles has a lot of extraneous Ads and unnecessary clutter. Please feel free to ignore all of that. I have read the article and for the most part it is factual, and more extensive then most. So with out further ado:</p>

</header>
<div class="entry-content">
<p>Water heaters are extremely important to your <a href="https://happydiyhome.com/best-drain-cleaner/">plumbing system</a>, and this goes for both residential buildings and commercial spaces. Many people are turning to newer options, and this can lead you to wonder what a tankless water heater costs because this style of water heater will only heat up the water you use. Traditionally, water heaters heated and stored water on a continuous basis, and this can be expensive if you use a lot of water. As long as they get installed and connected correctly, it’s easy to control your tankless water heater cost for years at a time.</p>
<p>You get the choice of a single point unit or whole house units. A single point unit is slightly more inexpensive to buy and install because you put them right next to a water source. Whole house units cost more to install, but they are powerful enough to heat all of the water in your home at one time. The tankless water heater cost has a slightly wider price range due to a variety of the factors, and it starts at $2,000 and goes up to around $4,500 from start to finish.</p>
<p>The average cost is right around $2,800 for a whole house gas unit. The tankless water heater cost has fluctuating labor rates too. The flow rate, brand, and type will also influence your tankless water heater cost, and this is why you want to get a few estimates before you settle on one company to perform the installation. This can help ensure that you get a fair price with professional-quality results.</p>

<p>In August Anita Grant, who lives alone, agreed to have the meter installed in her Harrow home.</p>
<p>But rather than the easy process promised in the advertisements, her son Neil says that the decision was set to cost her £3,840 for a new boiler plus £250 redecorating costs, after SSE first said it would fix it, but then denied any liability.</p>
<p>Only after the<em> Observer</em> got involved did SSE agree to cover the cost of the replacement boiler and the additional redecorating costs.</p>

<h3 class="entry-header">Mist Showers: Sustainable Decadence?</h3>
<div class="entry-content">
<div class="entry-body">
<p>The daily shower would be hard to sustain in a world without fossil fuels. The mist shower, a satisfying but forgotten technology which uses very little water and energy, could be a solution. Designer Jonas Görgen developed a do-it-yourself kit to convert almost any shower into a mist shower and sent me one to try out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e888330240a4be94e0200d-700wi" alt="Mist-shower-hack-kit" /></p>

<h2><strong>The Carbon Footprint of the Daily Shower</strong></h2>
<p>The shower doesn’t get much attention in the context of climate change. However, like <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2010/09/piston-powered-aircraft-as-fuel-efficient-as-current-average-jet.html">airplanes</a>, <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2008/06/citroen-2cv.html">cars</a>, and <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/02/heating-people-not-spaces.html">heating systems</a>, it has become a very wasteful and carbon-intensive way to provide for a basic need: washing the body. Each day, many of us pour roughly 70 litres of hot water over our bodies in order to be “clean”.</p>
<p>This practice requires two scarce resources: water and energy. More attention is given to the showers&#8217; high water consumption, but energy use is just as problematic. Hot water production accounts for the second most significant use of energy in many homes (after heating), and much of it is used for showering. Water treatment and distribution also use lots of energy.</p>
<p>In contrast to the energy used for space heating, which has decreased during the last decades, the energy used for hot water in households has been steadily growing. One of the reasons is that people are showering longer and more frequently, and using increasingly powerful shower heads. For example, in the Netherlands from 1992 to 2016, shower frequency increased from 0.69 to 0.72 showers per day, shower duration increased from 8.2 to 8.9 minutes, and the average water flow increased from 7.5 to 8.6 litres per minute. [1]</p>
<blockquote><p>In many industrial societies it&#8217;s now common to shower at least once per day</p></blockquote>

<p>Go there and read and read and read. I may never take a shower again. More next week.</p>

<h2><strong>1. Magnetized Refrigerators</strong></h2>
<p>Research and development of new refrigeration technologies has helped to increase residential energy savings. It is estimated that refrigerators sold in the U.S. use about <a href="http://www.climatetechwiki.org/technology/fridges">60% less energy</a> today than they did twenty years ago. While the cost of an energy efficient refrigerator can be more expensive, in the long term, the cost to keep it running is much more cost effective than a less efficient model.</p>
<p>In order for companies to sell refrigerators that are eligible for energy savings, they must meet specific <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/files/specs//private/ENERGY%20STAR Final Version 5.0 Residential Refrigerators and Freezers Program Requirements.pdf">Energy Star program requirements</a>. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets the criteria for this program.</p>
<p>As part of the Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy?s funding program, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and General Electric have teamed up on a <a href="http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/downloads/magnetocaloric-refrigeration">magentocaloric refrigeration research and development project</a>. Their goal is to build a residential refrigerator that consumes <a href="http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/10/f18/emt50_momen_042414.pdf">25% less energy</a> than the current competition. Instead of using vapor compression, the team is using a technology known as the magnetocaloric effect (MCE). It?s a process where temperature is controlled by a changing magnetic field. This approach eliminates the use of</p>

<div class="article-summary">
<p>Vistra plans to acquire electricity provider Crius Energy Trust.</p>

<div class="article-meta"><span class="article-author"><a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/authors/emma-foehringer-merchant">Emma Foehringer Merchant</a> </span> <span class="article-date">February 08, 2019</span></div>
<p>Vistra Energy, a retail power provider to 2.9 million customers, announced this week it intends to purchase Crius Energy Trust. DNV GL confirmed to Greentech Media that the acquisition makes Vistra the largest residential retail electric power provider in the U.S. based on number of customers.</p>
<p>A company most recently in the news for its involvement in the record-setting <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/pges-recording-breaking-battery-proposal-wins-loses">Moss Landing</a> project, Vistra purchased Crius for about $328 million and will assume $108 million of that company’s net debt. Crius, a multi-level energy seller that provides electricity including solar power through a number of brands, has about 1 million customers.</p>
<p>In announcing the deal, Vistra President and CEO Curt Morgan said the Crius portfolio has “a high degree of overlap with Vistra&#8217;s generation fleet and complements Vistra&#8217;s existing municipal aggregation and large commercial and industrial portfolio in the Midwest and Northeast markets.”</p>

<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="22">California has taken the final step to be the first state in the nation to require solar panels on new homes.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="23">The California Building Standards Commission on Wednesday unanimously <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/05/07/california-solar-mandate/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">upheld a May 9 decision</a> to require solar panels on homes up to three stories. The requirement goes into effect Jan. 1, 2020.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="24">Currently, just <a href="https://af.reuters.com/article/africaTech/idAFL1N1SG0SP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">9% of single-family detached homes in California have solar panels</a>. But as the state pushes toward decreasing greenhouse gas emissions—and with a 2045 goal to <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/08/29/california-sb100-clean-energy-bill/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">transition to a fully renewable energy grid devoid of fossil fuels—</a>this rule will help accelerate that progress. Aside from energy efficiency, solar panels reduce ozone-damaging household emissions, most of which come from <a href="https://af.reuters.com/article/africaTech/idAFL1N1SG0SP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">natural gas-generated electricity</a>.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="25">In the long-term, solar panels benefit homeowners. While the upfront cost for building a home will increase—by as much as <a href="https://af.reuters.com/article/africaTech/idAFL1N1SG0SP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">$10,000, according to the California Energy Commission,</a> or as much as $25,000-30,000, according to <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2018/05/04/california-to-become-first-u-s-state-mandating-solar-on-new-homes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">home construction company</a> Meritage Homes—long-term energy bill savings will be considerable.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="26"><a href="https://af.reuters.com/article/africaTech/idAFL1N1SG0SP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a> reports that a homeowner could expect to save $19,000 in energy costs over 30 years, while Meritage Homes <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2018/05/04/california-to-become-first-u-s-state-mandating-solar-on-new-homes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">predicts</a> reduced operating costs could amount to as much as $50,000-60,000 over a 25-year period.</p>
