</div>
<div class="entry">
<p>After doing some research on renewable energy systems or alternative energy systems as many will call them, I wanted to get the information out there as far as the advantages and disadvantages of the 2 main renewable energy systems, <a title="wind turbine generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind turbine generators</a> and <a title="photovoltaic solar panels" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">photovoltaic solar panels</a>.</p>
<p>Both <a title="solar panel" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panel</a> and <a title="wind generator systems" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator systems</a> are similar as far as how they are setup. You can have the <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> grid tied or off grid, same as <a title="solar panels" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panels</a>. Both the <a title="solar panel photovoltaic panel" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panel (photovoltaic panel)</a> and <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> will need a battery bank if you are using an off grid system. Both of these renewable energy systems will produce clean energy and help the environment as well as save you money in your home!</p>
<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Wind Generator Systems and Solar Panel Systems</h3>
<p>Now onto some of the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative energy system. None of this information is from my own personal experience as I do not have the financial funds to support the research. So the information about these renewable energy systems have came from researching the internet, talking to people that have these alternative energy systems, and of course some calculations of my own (prices, efficiency, etc.).</p>
<h3>Wind Turbine Generator System Pros and Cons</h3>
<p>The main advantage of <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> is that they can produce electricity day or night as long as there is wind. <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">Wind generators</a> need less space on your land to produce sufficient electricity. <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">Wind generators</a> are able to produce more electric for the same price. If you spend $1,000.00 on <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> you can produce 1kW – 2kW, with <a title="solar panels" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panels</a> you may only produce around .5kW – .75kW with the same $1,000.00. <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generators" target="_blank">Wind generators</a> have moving parts, so there is always wear and tear on these moving parts. Bearings can go bad, propeller blades can be struck by objects, and heat may be generated. Your <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> will be installed on a tower or pole of some sort to gain height where there is more wind, allowing lighting to possibly strike your <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a>. As wind hits the propeller blades there will be noise created, think of a fan and how they sound, or even taking a rope and swinging it fast in circles. You will get some of this noise from your <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a>. The propellers of the <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> can also produce shadows flickering. Birds can get killed from flying into your wind generator’s propellers. There are vertical <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generators</a> which will prevent this. So the quick break down of the <a title="wind generator system" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator system</a>:</p>

<p>Offshore wind is coming to the United States.</p>
<p>Construction on what will be the country’s first offshore wind farm <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/240184-work-begins-on-nations-first-offshore-wind-farm">started Monday</a> in Rhode Island. The wind farm, which is being developed by Deepwater Wind, will be located off of the coast of Block Island, a small island about 13 miles south of Rhode Island. Once completed, the five-turbine, 30-megawatt wind farm will produce enough energy to power all homes and businesses on Block Island, which previously relied on diesel generators, according to the Sierra Club. The wind farm will also send energy to mainland Rhode Island. It’s expected to come online in fall 2016.</p>
<p>Environmental groups, many of which have pushed for the project since it started going through hearings in 2013, applauded the start of construction. Bruce Nilles, senior campaign director for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign, told ThinkProgress that the start of construction was a “landmark” moment for the U.S. wind industry, and that it “really makes real the promise offshore wind has” in the U.S., particularly on the East Coast.</p>
<div id="in-content-ad"> “This is technology that will play a very important part in decarbonizing electric sector,” he said.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since we are in a Utility state of mind this week, the PSC of Michigan just released this report according to the folks at AWEA.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.awea.org/blog/index.cfm?customel_dataPageID_1699=14546">http://www.awea.org/blog/index.cfm?customel_dataPageID_1699=14546</a></p>
<h4>Mich. Public Service Commission: Renewable energy cheaper than coal</h4>
<div>Posted: 2012-03-02 Tom Gray</div>
<p>We often run &#8220;Fact check&#8221; articles on this blog when  fossil-fuel-funded &#8220;experts&#8221; exaggerate the cost of electricity  generated with wind power (for a particularly bald-faced recent example,  see <a href="http://www.awea.org/blog/index.cfm?customel_dataPageID_1699=14520">Fact check: American Enterprise Institute epic FAIL on study of wind costs</a>, Feb. 29), but perhaps this one should be titled &#8220;Reality check.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reality: the Michigan Public Service Commission (PSC) recently issued a  report that finds that electricity generated from renewable energy  sources, at an average cost of $91 per megawatt-hour (9.1  cents/kilowatt-hour), is almost one-third cheaper than the cost of  electricity from a new coal-fired power plant ($133 per MWh, or 13.3  cents/kWh).</p>
<p>Further, the report notes, &#8220;The actual cost of renewable energy  contracts submitted to the Commission to date shows a downward pricing  trend.  This was the case as of the filing of this report in February of  2011 and continues to be the case, as <strong>the two most recent contracts approved by the Commission for new wind capacity have levelized costs of $61-$64 per MWh</strong>.  This is significantly lower than the levelized costs of the first wind contracts submitted in 2009.&#8221; (emphasis added)</p>
<p>The report is one in a series required annually from the Commission to  the state legislature, reporting on the impact of the state&#8217;s Renewable  Energy Standard (RES), which requires utilities to obtain 10 percent of  the electricity they provide from renewable energy sources by 2015.</p>
<p>Other highlights from the report:</p>
<p>&#8211; While utilities are allowed to charge customers extra for renewable  energy, customers are also seeing savings due to wind.  Said the  Commission, &#8220;While &#8230; surcharges have an impact on electric rates,  there are also economic benefits attributable to an increase in  renewable energy generation sources and improved energy efficiency. As  noted in previous sections, the cost of energy generated by renewable  sources continues to decline and is cheaper than new coal-fired  generation.</p>

<p><strong>OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY MEETS OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY STORAGE.</strong><br />
<em>by Bruce Mulliken, Green Energy News </em></p>
<p>Eventually  the United States will get its first offshore wind farm. No one is  taking bets as to when it will go online. There have been many  proposals, but so far resistance onshore has kept those projects from  being built.</p>
<p>Still, wind resources are much better  offshore than on and those windy resources are often near heavily  populated areas that will be able and willing to consume electricity  generated by those reliable ocean breezes.</p>
<p>As with  many relatively expensive technologies it’s not such a bad thing to be a  late adopter. Early adopters make and have to correct mistakes at a  high cost. Early adopters too have only earliest versions of the  technology to work with.  Late adopters, on the other hand, learn from  the mistakes of early adopters and need not repeat them. Late adopters  also get to use newer, more sophisticated versions of the technology in  question.</p>
<p>Offshore wind is one of those relatively expensive technologies that it’s OK to be a late adopter.</p>
<p>When  U.S. offshore wind builders finally get around to planting the first  turbine in the ocean bottom (or perhaps floating turbines in deep water  over the horizon) they’ll have a better idea of the costs, know exactly  how to install them and they’ll have access to far more powerful  turbines than those used in the first offshore wind farms in Europe. The  U.S. will benefit by being slow to adopt offshore wind, but the time  has come to embrace the technology; wind developers know this, so does  the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Even as dollars are being  pinched in Washington, the Department of Energy has put aside $50.5  million for projects that support offshore wind energy development. The  Department of the Interior too, in its Smart for the Start program, has  given a hand to offshore wind development by designating four areas  along the Mid-Atlantic coast to be on the fast track for regulatory  approval.</p>
<p>The funding being offered by DOE can be  used for the development of innovative wind turbine design tools and  hardware to provide the foundation for a cost-competitive and  world-class offshore wind industry in the United States (up to $25  million over 5 years); for baseline studies and targeted environmental  research to characterize key industry sectors and factors limiting the  deployment of offshore wind ( up to $18 million over 3 years); and for  the development and refinement of next-generation designs for wind  turbine drivetrains (up to $7.5 million over 3 years).</p>
<p>The  Department of the Interior has chosen areas on the Outer Continental  Shelf offshore Delaware (122 square nautical miles), Maryland (207), New  Jersey (417), and Virginia (165) to receive early environmental reviews  that will help to lessen the time required for review, leasing and  approval of offshore wind turbine facilities.</p>
<p>Government isn’t alone in seeking to develop offshore wind.</p>

<p><strong>It&#8217;s not necessary to become a nerd to find out how wind power works</strong></p>
<p>Wind is the result of the uneven heating of the Earth by the sun and the fact that temperatures will always be attempting to reach an equilibrium (heat is always moving to a cooler area). With the rising price of energy and the damage to the environment from classic fuels, it is increasingly equitable to harvest this renewable resource.</p>
<p>The benefits of wind energy are that it&#8217;s virtually free (after you purchase the equipment) and there&#8217;s no pollution. The disadvantages include the fact it is not a constant source (the speed varies and many times it is insufficient to make electricity) and it typically requires about one acre of land.</p>
<p><strong>How Wind Energy Works</strong></p>
<p>The volume of power that can be found varies by wind speed. The amount available is named it&#8217;s power density which is measured in watts per square meter. Due to this, the U.S. Department of Energy has separated wind energy into classes from 1 to 7. The typical wind speed for class 1 is 9.8 mph or less while the average for a class 7 is 21.1 or more. For effective power production, class 2 winds (11.5 mph average speed) are usually required.</p>
<p>In general, wind speeds increase as you get higher above the Earth. Due to this, the typical wind mill comes with a tower no less than 30 feet above obstructions. That there are two basic different types of towers employed for residential wind power systems (free standing and guyed). Free standing towers are self supporting and are usually heavier which means they take special equipment (cranes) to erect them. Guyed towers are supported on a concrete base and anchored by wires for support. They typically are not as heavy and most manufacturer&#8217;s produce tilt down models which may be easily raised and lowered for maintenance.</p>
<p>The kinetic (moving energy) from the winds is harnessed by a device called a turbine. This turbine contains airfoils (blades) that capture the energy of the wind and use it to turn the shaft of an alternator (like you have on a car only bigger).</p>
<p>There are two basic types of blades (drag style and lifting style). We all have seen pictures of old-fashioned windmills with the large flat blades which are an example of the drag style of airfoil. Lifting style blades are twisted instead of flat and resemble the propellor of a small airplane.</p>
<p>A turbine is classified as to whether it is built to be installed with the rotor in a horizontal or vertical position and whether the wind strikes the blades or the tower first. A vertical turbine typically requires less land for it&#8217;s installation and is a better option for the more urban areas of the world. An upwind turbine is designed for the wind to impact the airfoils before it does the tower.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.residentialwindturbines.org/wind-scheme-grid-tied.gif" target="_self" rel="noopener">http://www.residentialwindturbines.org/residential-wind-turbine.jpg</a></p>
<p>These units ordinarily have a tail on the turbine which is needed to keep the unit pointed into the wind. A downwind turbine doesn&#8217;t need a tail as the wind acting on the blades tends to maintain it oriented properly.</p>
<p>These turbine systems would be damaged if they were to be permitted to turn at excessive speeds. Therefore, units will need to have automatic over-speed governing systems. Some systems use electrical braking systems although some use mechanical type brakes.</p>
<p>The output electricity from the alternator is sent to a controller which conditions it for use in the home. The use of residential wind power systems requires the home to either remain linked with the utility grid or store electricity in a battery for use when the wind doesn&#8217;t blow sufficiently.</p>
<p>When the home is tied to the grid, the surplus electricity that is produced by the residential wind power system can be sold to the utility company to lower and sometimes even eliminate your electric bill. During times with not enough wind, the home is supplied power from the utility company.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.residentialwindturbines.org/wind-scheme-grid-tied.gif" target="_self" rel="noopener">http://www.residentialwindturbines.org/wind-scheme-grid-tied.gif</a></p>
<p><strong>The Cost of Wind Energy</strong></p>
<p>Small residential wind power turbines can be an attractive alternative, or addition, to those people needing over 100-200 watts of power for their home, business, or remote facility. Unlike PV&#8217;s, which stay at basically the same cost per watt independent of array size, wind turbines get more affordable with increasing system size. At the 50 watt size level, for instance, a small residential power turbine would cost about $8.00/watt in comparison to approximately $6.00/watt for a PV module.</p>
<p>This is the reason, all things being equal, Photo voltaic is less expensive for very small loads. As the system size gets larger, however, this &#8220;rule-of-thumb&#8221; reverses itself.</p>
<p>At 300 watts the wind generator costs are down to $2.50/watt, while the PV costs are still at $6.00/watt. For a 1,500 watt wind system the cost is down to $2.00/watt and at 10,000 watts the price of a wind generator (excluding electronics) is down to $1.50/watt.</p>

<h1>Getting bigger, going green</h1>
<h2>St. John’s expansion will be environmentally friendly</h2>
<p><a onclick="return hs.htmlExpand(this, { contentId:  'highslide-html-shared600', objectType:  'ajax',width:'600',wrapperClassName: 'borderless'} )" href="http://www.illinoistimes.com/Springfield/articles.by.Author-377.html">By Patrick Yeagle</a></p>
<p>As St. John’s Hospital is preparing to renovate its downtown campus, the  135-year-old Springfield institution is paying special attention to  minimizing the project’s environmental footprint and maximizing local  economic benefits.</p>
<p>On March 31, hospital officials announced a  $162 million proposal to demolish certain old structures on the  hospital’s campus and replace them with more modern surgery, pharmacy  and patient areas.</p>
<p>Dave Olejniczak, chief operating officer at  St. John’s, says the project will incorporate several cost-saving,  environmentally friendly designs, such as paints, stains and adhesives  with low toxin levels, energy-efficient light fixtures and natural  lighting whenever possible.</p>
<p>“A little bit of it is an investment  up front, but the majority of it is going to be a cost savings down the  road, in particular when we focus on the glass elements around the  facility itself,” he says. “With having the natural light, it’s going to  reduce the amount of artificial light we have to generate.”</p>
<p>Recycling  is a big part of the design as well. From the carpet made of recycled  fibers to the reuse of scrap materials such as steel and wood,  Olejniczak says the project will uphold the hospital’s “stewardship  values.”</p>
<p>“Envitronmental stewardship, from a Fransiscan  perspective, is ensuring that we’re using the resources that we’re  currently given to the best of our ability, and to take what we have and  reuse it or recycle it,” Olejniczak said.</p>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding your brief article about St. John Hospital&#8217;s future building plans. It is laudable that they plan on making that building locally built and green. However I did not hear &#8220;state-of-the-art&#8221; speak included in that admittedly short article. First and foremost I hope the Hospital will perform a green tear down. We should be wasting as little as possible these days. Putting perfectly good materials in the landfill is no longer acceptable.</p>
<p>Second I hope they also perform a green rebuild so that everything in the new Hospital wing will be recycled. Finally I hope that the new wing will generate its own energy and be super efficient in its energy usage. If they use windows, please use windows that generate electricity. If they have a roof I hope that it has wind turbines on top and plenty of plants to absorb the water that lands there. I hope that they put in geothermal heating and cooling systems. This is after all about people&#8217;s health. If St. Johns becomes a beacon of how we can lead our lives without pollutants then they will be contributing to the over all health of our community.</p>
<p>As the article pointed out it is also about health care costs. Industry estimates are that if the medical community used energy efficiently they could cut our medical cost by 10 to 15%. That would be a huge benefit to us all.</p>

<p>Mount Pulaski, Ill. &#8211;</p>
<p>A high-tech wind turbine that can generate  10,000 watts of power was installed near Logan County’s oldest bank  Wednesday.</p>
<p>The turbine, which sits atop a 120-foot tower, will supply about  half, or possibly more than half, of the electricity used by Farmers  Bank of Mount Pulaski.</p>
<p>The apparatus cost about $65,000, some of which will be offset by tax  credits, said Rick Volle, president of Farmers Bank, which was  established in 1872.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of these going up on a larger scale. We think it’s  something worth doing,” Volle said. “…We are figuring about a 12-year  payoff on it, and it has a life of about 30 years.”</p>
<p>Installation of the turbine on the square in Mount Pulaski drew a  crowd of about two-dozen people. They watched as a crane lifted the  tower into the air and workmen slowly moved the base over to a concrete  pad. The turbine, complete with blades, was already installed on top.</p>
<p>By 12:15 p.m., the tower and turbine were in place. It now stands  across the street from the historic Mount Pulaski Courthouse where  Abraham Lincoln argued cases.</p>
<p>“I guess it’s progress for our town, and the bank in particular,”  said Mike Cyrulik, who watched the work from across the street. “I think  it’s going to be a great addition to town.”</p>
<p>Cyrulik was one of the first people to stop and watch. When the big  crane took over, more people came out from downtown shops to see the  tower rise into the air.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty interesting for a little town,” Cyrulik said.</p>
<p>Mount Pulaski, about 25 miles northeast of Springfield, sits on a  hill that rises above the surrounding farmland.</p>
<p>John Wyss, owner of Central Illinois Wind and Solar, the company that  installed the turbine, said downtown Mount Pulaski is a good spot for  the new technology.</p>

<h1>Ann Arbor Veteran Affairs hospital gets wind turbine</h1>
<h4>By <a href="http://connect.mlive.com/user/spepple/index.html">Steve  Pepple</a></h4>
<h5>December 02, 2008, 7:06AM</h5>
<div><img decoding="async" src="http://blog.mlive.com/annarbornews_impact/2008/12/large_vaturbine_120208.jpg" alt="" />Eliyahu Gurfinkel | The Ann Arbor NewsDarryl Snabes, left, and Jeff Means are responsible for  the installation of a wind turbine on the roof of the VA Ann Arbor  Healthcare System building. Snabes is the local project manager and  Means the regional energy manager at the VA.</div>
<p>A small wind turbine now spins atop the Ann Arbor Veteran Affairs  hospital, contributing to the hospital&#8217;s utility needs while satisfying a  new federal requirement for renewable energy.</p>
<p>Hospital administrators installed the vertical turbine last month as  part of an ongoing plan to generate about 7.5 percent of the hospital&#8217;s  energy needs from renewable energy, including wind and solar, by 2012.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a baby step, but we&#8217;re optimistic,&#8221; said Jeff Means, energy  manager for VA hospitals in Michigan and nearby states.</p>
<p>The turbine and its installation cost about $100,000. If it is  successful in generating enough energy, the hospital could install  additional turbines and solar panels to generate energy, Means said.</p>
<p>The turbine, which weighs about 1,000 pounds, is 16 feet tall and 3  feet wide. As the wind spins the vertical turbine, a generator in its  base sends direct electrical current through several boxes to transform  the power into alternating current to be used by the hospital.</p>

<p>There appears to be 2 schools of thought here. Or maybe three. The first is the literal image itself, that of asking to get into heaven. Instead of an automatic sorting mechanism  for heaven and hell maybe everyone has to ask to get in. A second though closely related meaning is that someone is lucky enough to escape hell but then are left knocking at a closed gate because they do not deserve to get in. But most are struck by its symbolic &#8220;nearness&#8221; to the act of Luther nailing his list of &#8220;short comings&#8221; on the Catholic Church&#8217;s door and the Protestant Reformation that followed:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=KgNBqNswpVL9yRwgzcHr0l9JqLd74yGQN4hyhPbX4QF3JtNy1bQT!-69977801!-16421419?docId=5007265930">http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=KgNBqNswpVL9y</a></p>

<p>Indeed the comparison to the ever opening of the 5 dominate religions (Chinese tao/numerology/spirits, Jewish, Hindu, Christian and Muslim, in no particular order) to include and love more &#8220;unlike&#8221; individual is the knocking I hear.</p>

<p>So,.. it is change you hear blowing. The general public has been treated to the coal/oil/natural gas chorus for years, &#8220;Alternatives will never do it all! We will need all forms of energy to supply all the needs!&#8221; This is nothing more than a complicated hiding behind your mother&#8217;s skirt form of argument. Or a slightly loopy form of the ugly stepchild argument &#8211; &#8220;he maybe ugly but he is related by marriage&#8221;.

<address class="byline author vcard">By <a href="http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/author/john-lorinc/" class="url fn" title="See all posts by John Lorinc">John Lorinc</a></address>
<p>             	<!-- The Content --></p>
<p class="w190 right"><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/27/10933.full.pdf"><img decoding="async" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/greeninc/mapwindstudy2.jpg" alt="Study" /></a><span class="credit"> </span> <span class="caption">In the lower 48 states, the potential from wind power is 16 times more than total electricity demand in the United States, the researchers suggest. </span></p>
<p>Global wind energy potential is considerably higher than previous estimates by both wind industry groups and government agencies, according to a Harvard University <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/27/10933.full.pdf">study</a> published last week in the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States.</a></p>
<p>The new research surfaced just weeks after T. Boone Pickens, citing rising financing costs, <a href="http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/07/pickens-drops-plan-for-largest-wind-farm/">scaled back his plans for the world’s largest wind farm in west Texas.</a></p>
<p>Using data from thousands of meteorological stations, the Harvard team estimated the world wind power potential to be 40 times greater than total current power consumption. A previous study cited in the paper put that multiple at about 7 times.</p>
<p>In the lower 48 states, the potential from wind power is 16 times more than total electricity demand in the United States, the researchers suggested – significantly greater than a <a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/pdfs/42864.pdf">2008 Department of Energy study that projected wind could supply a fifth of all electricity in the country by 2030</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-16761"></span></p>
<p>While remote regions of Russia and Canada have the greatest theoretical potential, the Harvard study pointed out that there are real gains to be made in high-emission nations, especially China, which has been rapidly constructing coal plants. “Large-scale development of wind power in China could allow for an 18-fold increase in electricity supply relative to consumption reported for 2005,” the Harvard study said.</p>
<p>The findings are “further validation of what we’ve been saying – that the United States is the <a href="http://greeninc.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/contest-replace-the-saudi-arabia-trope/">Saudi Arabia of wind</a>,” said Michael Goggin, an electricity industry analyst for the <a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/pdfs/42864.pdf">American Wind Energy Association</a>.</p>
<p>The authors based their calculations on the deployment of 2.5- to 3-megawatt wind turbines situated either in accessible rural areas that are neither frozen nor forested, or relatively shallow offshore locations. They also used a conservative 20 percent estimate for capacity factor, a measure of how much energy a given turbine actually produces.</p>
