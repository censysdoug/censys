										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jennifer works at someplace called the Public Health Library, which I suppose is a great place to work.They apparently push plant based diets. I am not aq vegetarian because i do not have the discipline&#8230;plus I love pork and fish so it ain&#8217;t happening BUT it is important for as many of  as can to switch. Just think of me as your lovable hypocrite. She sent along a bunch of resources and I don&#8217;t normally post those, but she is so nice :+}</p>

<p>As cities grow and incomes rise around the world, more and more people are leaving gardens and traditional diets behind and eating refined sugars, refined fats, oils and resource- and land-intense agricultural products like beef. This global dietary transition is harming the health of both people and the planet, says new research.</p>
<p>But the study also shows that shifting away from this trajectory and choosing healthier traditional Mediterranean, pescatarian or vegetarian diets could not only boost human lifespans and quality of life, but also slash emissions and save habitat for endangered species.</p>
<p>And we better hurry; the scientists project that if the trend continues, the situation will be worse yet with greenhouse gas emissions up by 80 percent by 2050.</p>
<p>Examining almost 50 years’ worth of data from the world’s 100 most populous countries, University of Minnesota Professor of Ecology G. David Tilman and graduate student Michael Clark illustrate how current diet trends are contributing to ever-rising agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and habitat degradation.</p>
<p>On top of that, they write: “These dietary shifts are greatly increasing the incidence of Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and other chronic non-communicable diseases that lower global life expectancies.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First there are places in the US where you can garden year round. Most of the southeast falls into this category. Yes there are issues around water use because much of off season gardening requires watering. But when you look at the exercise and healthy food it can produce, plus the off setting of transportation costs, especially in gasoline costs overall the good out weighs the bad. I would contend with a solar space attached to a house or proper cold frames you can actually year round garden up to the Great Lakes latitudes. But this is not what traditionally has been considered fall gardening. I also might add something will take up later that winter crop covers can be considered both fall gardening but also composting. I also can hear a lot of you saying that you are sooooo glad when the gardening season is &#8220;over&#8221; that the thought of getting the rototiller out in August or September is too painful to consider. But we all over plant and also underestimate the amount of work and the amout of time involved. To which I say, &#8220;Stop it&#8221;.  Here is a good primer from East Texans &#8211; the home of Stevie Ray Vaughn.</p>
<p><a href="http://easttexasgardening.tamu.edu/homegardens/fallveggarden.html">http://easttexasgardening.tamu.edu/homegardens/fallveggarden.html</a></p>
<h1>Prepare In July For Fall/Winter Vegetable Harvest</h1>
<h1>by Keith C. Hansen, Extension Horticulturist</h1>
<p>:}</p>
<p>I skipped to the gardening part of this article.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Every time you prepare the soil to plant a new crop, always mix in as  much compost as you can get your hands on. Add well-decomposed animal  manure, fertilizer and lime if soil tests indicate a low fertility or  pH, and work all ingredients into the soil.</p>
<p>Southern peas such as blackeye, purplehull, cream and crowders  make a great, edible summer cover crop for building the soil and  providing food. The pea vines can be mowed and rototilled under while  still green for extra soil building benefits or allowed to produce peas  and then tilled under.</p>
<p>Tomatoes and peppers need to be planted soon &#8211; by the first of  August &#8211; if they are going to make a good crop before first frost. What  if your garden spot is not yet ready? Buy your transplants now and grow  them in a larger container to plant in the garden later.</p>
<p>Get either 6-pack transplants or 4-inch transplants. Put them in a  1- or 3-gallon nursery container filled with potting soil. Do not use  soil from your garden. Add slow release fertilizer (like Osmocote or  other slow release formulation) to the soil mix. Set the pots in a sunny  spot in the yard, not in the shade!</p>
<p>Every time you water, use a water-soluble fertilizer solution  instead of just plain water. Your transplants will continue to grow and  be healthy, just as if you have transplanted them directly into the  ground. Once your garden site is ready, you will have large, healthy  tomato and pepper plants to set out. They will be easier to take care of  and you will be assured of a bountiful harvest before the first freeze  of winter.</p>
<p>Grow fast maturing tomato varieties for the fall harvest. Look  for varieties with less than 75 days to maturity, such as &#8216;Merced&#8217;,  &#8216;Bingo&#8217;, &#8216;Celebrity&#8217;, &#8216;Whirlaway&#8217;, and &#8216;Carnival&#8217;. &#8216;Surefire&#8217; is a  smaller, processing tomato variety (with thicker skin) which sets and  matures all of its tomatoes very quickly, giving you a &#8220;surefire&#8221;  harvest that beats the first freeze. Most cherry tomatoes will bear  within 65 days of transplanting.</p>
<p>Timing is very important for a successful fall garden. Heat  tolerant/cold sensitive crops need to be planted in time to mature  before cold weather slows and stops growth, while cool season/heat  sensitive crops are planted late enough to avoid the heat, but early  enough to take the first frosts of winter.</p>
<p>The following are optimal &#8220;windows of time&#8221; for planting fall vegetables:</p>

<p>Seeded vegetables can be tricky to get up in the heat of summer.  Soil often forms a crust on the surface after tillage and watering. This  “crust” can hinder tender seedlings from breaking through. Here are a  couple of tips to help get seedlings up in the summer.</p>

<p>So we end this meditation where we have been for 3 days on building a house that does what it should, make your life cheap and comfortable. This all started with an Energy Audit. Could that get you to build a better home in the future? Sure it could. It just depends on how important the planet Earth is to you. It is very important to me. Other people think of it as their personal toilet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/kit-eaton/technomix/your-future-homes-roof-will-be-eco-friendly-too" target="_self" rel="noopener">http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/kit-eaton/technomix/your-future-homes-roof-will-be-eco-friendly-too</a></p>
<h2 id="hdr_article-headline">Your Future Home&#8217;s Roof Will Be Eco-Friendly Too</h2>
<p><cite>BY <a title="View user profile." href="http://www.fastcompany.com/user/148610">Kit Eaton</a></cite>Fri Oct 9, 2009</p>
<p>Scientists at MIT have invented a smart roofing material that takes a new thermal-management approach to eco-design. It&#8217;s a different approach to previous efforts, of which there are many. We&#8217;ve rounded them up for you, starting with the latest, below.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2482/3995789102_03946c3715.jpg" alt="thermeleon" width="300" height="300" /><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>MIT&#8217;s Black and White Solution</strong></p>
<p>MIT&#8217;s Thermeleon material is a composite of layers that makes it thermochromic&#8211;on exposure to heat it changes color from black to white. It works by sandwiching a common polymer between flexible plastic layers, with a black one at the back&#8211;when cold the polymer solution stays dissolved and the black rear face shows through, and when it heats up the solution condenses to form light-scattering droplets.</p>
<p>The upshot is that when the sun is shining a roof tile covered in the material is white-colored, scattering up to 80% of the sunlight back and thus keeping the building beneath the roof cooler. The result is a 20% reduction in cost to keep the interior at a comfortable temperature in the summer, a figure which also comes with an eco-friendly drop in the electricity supply demands. During winter, of course, you&#8217;d prefer your roof to capture as much heat as possible from the sun, which is where the black coloring is handy&#8211;the tiles scatter just 30% of incoming solar radiation then.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s working on micro-encapsulating the chemicals, so that in future they may work as a paintable or spray-on coating, and then if the prices drop to match the innovation, the tech could also find much use in the developing world</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs8HcICxzAU&amp;feature=related" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs8HcICxzAU&amp;feature=related</a> )</p>
<p>Why haven&#8217;t we done things like this for years:</p>
<p><strong>Dow Chemicals&#8217; Covert Solar Tiles</strong></p>
<p>If your house design calls for a shingled roof instead of a tiled one, and you live in an area where theft of expensive roof-top solar panels is a problem, then <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/ariel-schwartz/sustainability/dows-solar-shingles-integrate-solar-power-rooftops">Dow Chemicals</a> has a neat trick.</p>
<p>Its Solar Shingles use thin-film copper indium gallium diselenide technology to make them cheap and light, and they&#8217;re designed to be intermingled with traditional asphalt roof tiles on a roof. That makes for easy installation, and lower visibility to street-level thieves.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2672/3987327835_9f37bee6d0_o.jpg" alt="solar roof shingles" width="620" height="376" /></p>
<p>And there you have it: Proof positive that in the future, our building roofing will do much more for us than keeping the sun, wind, and rain off our heads. They all make good sense, of course, since traditional roofs spend all their time staring at the sun rather than harnessing its rays for energy. Now if there were only a clever hybrid of all these different ideas&#8230;</p>

<h1>Eco tree houses &#8211; the homes of the future</h1>

</ul>
<p>Scientists from the US and Israel have developed the trees that can be shaped into the structure of innovative homes.</p>
<p><!-- BEFORE ACI -->The ingenious tree houses naturally provide shade and can also be used to process waste and reduce carbon emissions.</p>
<p>The researchers at Tel Aviv University and a branch of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are confident the first prototype home could be ready in just ten years.</p>
<p>Plantware, the organisation behind the technology, have already built bus-shelters, park benches and traffic lights using the advanced techniques of airoponics, where plants are grown without soil.</p>
<p>Now they have built a model for a tree house to be used in cities.</p>
<p>The extraordinary structure is build from actual tree roots that are grown to be mallable and then hardened into a structure like steel girders. The houses can be equipped with solar panels and wind turbines to generate electricity and even convert human waste into valuable nutrient for the living tree.</p>
<p>Different species of trees could be chosen for different environments so for example, willows could be used in England and giant American redwoods in California.</p>
<p>However at the moment the tree homes would be prohibitively expensive to all but a few.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>So, you want a stylish green home, but think it will cost the earth? Think  again. Home asked three leading exponents of sustainable design to come up  with the ultimate green new-build house to suit three very different budgets  – and the results were spectacular.</p>
<p>All had the same brief: to design a home for a young part-time teacher and her  husband, an IT specialist. The imaginary couple have two children, aged nine  and seven, and own an end-of-terrace plot on a tree-lined street of  Victorian houses. The house can’t be taller than neighbouring three-storey  homes, and must be as green as possible.</p>
<p>Dan Burr, 40, an associate partner at Sheppard Robson, which has offices in  London and Manchester, has come up with a three-bedroom, 1,500 sq ft home  costing £250,000 (plus land costs). Burr was the design director on  Britain’s first zero-carbon house, the Lighthouse, built in Watford last  year. The building meets level 6 of the Code for Sustainable Homes, with  which all new homes in Britain will have to comply by 2016.</p>
<p>Justin Bere, 48, principal of the north London-based firm Bere Architects,  designed a four-bedroom, 1,800 sq ft home costing £400,000 (plus land  costs). His residential projects include Focus House, built in 2006 in  Finsbury Park, north London, which won the Riba London Region Award 2007,  among other prizes. His practice is a devotee of PassivHaus, an established  German style of energy-efficient construction.</p>
<p>The third property is a five-bedroom, 2,500 sq ft home costing £600,000,  designed by the husband-and-wife team Catherine Burd and Buddy Haward, both  41. Based in northwest London, they devised the low-energy Brooke Coombes  House, in Ealing, west London, which in 2002 won the Riba Manser Medal, and  are designing 600 sustainable homes in the Rochester Riverside scheme at  Thames Gateway.</p>
<p>Their EZ House has three key principles: its construction must incorporate  local materials from sustainable sources and low-energy build methods; it  must consume little or no energy, so conserve or generate it on site; and  the flexible design must have non-load-bearing internal walls, so that it  can be adapted to the changing needs of the occupants</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is true. Even though stories about disappearing honey bees, or even Colony Collapse Disorder have appeared on 60 minutes, Scientific America and even NatGeo. There is very little truth to it. It is largely a North American and European commercial pollination problem which would never really effect food production much. If they worked me as hard as they do the commercial bees I&#8217;d fly away too. My Pawpaws are pollinated by flies so I don&#8217;t really care. If you don&#8217;t believe me read this:</p>

<p>But this and yesterday&#8217;s post got me to thinking about eating simply and it furthers my meditation on living off the land. Humans have come to eat so complicatedly and chemically. Did you ever wonder why Lay&#8217;s Potato Chips claims that&#8221;you can&#8217;t eat just one&#8221; and they are probably right? I am no extremist veggan or anything approaching one. There are 200,000 deer in Illinois and if oil collapsed tomorrow and with it civilization I would go shoot one the day after. I don&#8217;t even know if the children still trick or treat for Unicef but in that spirit let&#8217;s start with Plump-i-nut factories in Africa:</p>

<p>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia, 21 February 2007 <span style="font-family: Arial;">–</span> UNICEF Executive Director Ann M. Veneman inaugurated Ethiopia’s first Plumpy’nut therapeutic food factory in Addis Ababa yesterday.</p>
<p>The inauguration marks a joint venture between UNICEF, US-based private donor and businesswoman Amy Robbins and the Hilina Enriched Foods Processing Centre.</p>
<p>Plumpy’nut is a high-protein and high-energy, peanut-based paste used for the treatment of severely undernourished children. An estimated 1.5 million children in Ethiopia are severely undernourished. At full capacity, Hilina Enriched Foods will produce up to 12 tons of the paste per day.</p>
<p>“Today as we open the doors of the fourth, and largest, factory in Africa that will produce Plumpy’nut, we are taking a step in the right direction in addressing the issue of malnutrition,” said Ms. Veneman.</p>
<p><span class="pagesubhead">Generous solution</span></p>
<p>In 2005, the Robbins family donated $1.3 million to UNICEF to allow the purchase and import of 267 tons of Plumpy’nut to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Formulated by French scientist Andre Briend in 1999, Plumpy’nut has been used to save children’s lives in major emergency situations in Darfur, Niger and Malawi.</p>

<p>Plumpy’nut requires no preparation or special supervision, so an untrained adult <span style="font-family: Arial;">– </span>such as a parent <span style="font-family: Arial;">– </span>can deliver it to an undernourished child at home, allowing governments to reduce the amount of money spent on therapeutic feeding stations. The paste has a two-year shelf life when unopened and stays fresh even after opening.</p>
<p>Though Plumpy’nut is relatively inexpensive and easy to transport, Ms. Robbins discovered that huge costs were incurred from its importation and that limited capacity at the French plant made it difficult to ensure timely food supplies from Europe.</p>
<p>To solve the problem, her family foundation donated $340,000 towards investment in the needed equipment to manufacture Plumpy’nut within Ethiopia.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that factory farming of animals pioneered here in the Corporate US of A is dangerous to the health of all involved including the humans. Everyone knows that eating cow flesh is probably not a good idea, at least everyday or even 2 or 3 times a week. Goats, sheep, fowl and pigs are much better alternatives.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat</a></p>
<p>The most recent genetic analysis<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> confirms the archaeological evidence that the <a title="Anatolia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia">Anatolian</a> <a class="mw-redirect" title="Zagros" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zagros">Zagros</a> are the likely origin of almost all domestic goats today. <a title="Neolithic" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic">Neolithic</a> farmers began to keep them for easy access to <a title="Milk" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk">milk</a> and meat, primarily, also for their dung, which was used as fuel and their bones, hair, and sinew for clothing, building, and tools.<sup id="cite_ref-hadog_0-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat#cite_note-hadog-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The earliest remnants of domesticated goats dating 10,000 before present are found in <a title="Ganj Dareh" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganj_Dareh">Ganj Dareh</a> in <a title="Iranian Kurdistan" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Kurdistan">Iranian Kurdistan</a>. Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that wandered on hills or other grazing areas, often tended by <a title="Goatherd" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goatherd">goatherds</a> who were frequently children or <a class="mw-redirect" title="Adolescent" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescent">adolescents</a>, similar to the more widely known <a title="Shepherd" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepherd">shepherd</a>. These methods of <a title="Herding" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herding">herding</a> are still used today.</p>
<p>Historically, goat hide has been used for water and <a title="Wine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine">wine</a> bottles in both traveling and transporting wine for sale. It has also been used to produce <a title="Parchment" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchment">parchment</a></p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Not to mention that the flesh is wonderful and so are the milk and cheese. They will eat just about anything and everyone should have at least 2. Again it is the GROWTH model that destroys the equilibrium of the planet. Simple is laughed at. People who juice their foods live much long because their foods are fresh and uncooked.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.powerjuicer.com/?gclid=CLyzu7yY4J0CFQ4hDQod9ilOMA">http://www.powerjuicer.com/?gclid=CLyzu7yY4J0CFQ4hDQod9ilOMA </a></p>
<p>Jack LaLane should know he has been at it for years:</p>
<p><a title="green04.jpg" href="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/green04.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/green04.jpg" alt="green04.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Our GROWTH system even prevents or even worse obliterates local options. When I found out about Pawpaws I was thoroughly amazed:</p>
<h2><span id="Cultivation_and_uses" class="mw-headline">Cultivation and uses</span></h2>
<p class="thumb tright">
<p class="thumbinner" style="width: 302px;"><a class="image" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Asimina_triloba_red_fern_farm.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="thumbimage" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Asimina_triloba_red_fern_farm.jpg/300px-Asimina_triloba_red_fern_farm.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="195" /></a></p>
<p class="thumbcaption">
<p class="magnify"><a class="internal" title="Enlarge" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Asimina_triloba_red_fern_farm.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="http://en.wikipedia.org/skins-1.5/common/images/magnify-clip.png" alt="" width="15" height="11" /></a></p>
<p><em>Asimina triloba</em> is often called <em>prairie banana</em> because of its banana-like creamy texture and flavor.</p>
<p>The pawpaw is native to shady, rich bottom lands, where it often forms a dense undergrowth in the forest. Where it dominates a tract it appears as a thicket of small slender trees, whose great leaves are borne so close together at the ends of the branches, and which cover each other so symmetrically, that the effect is to give a peculiar imbricated appearance to the tree.<sup id="cite_ref-Keeler_0-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawpaw#cite_note-Keeler-0"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Although it is a delicious and nutritious fruit, it has never been cultivated on the scale of apples and peaches, primarily because only frozen fruit will store or ship well. It is also difficult to transplant because of fragile hairy root tentacles that tend to break off unless a cluster of moist soil is retained on the root mass. <a title="Cultivar" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivar">Cultivars</a> are propagated by chip budding or whip <a title="Grafting" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafting">grafting</a>.</p>
<p>In recent years the pawpaw has attracted renewed interest, particularly among <a title="Organic farming" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_farming">organic growers</a>, as a native fruit which has few to no pests, and which therefore requires no <a title="Pesticide" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide">pesticide</a> use for cultivation. The shipping and storage problem has largely been addressed by freezing. Among backyard gardeners it also is gaining in popularity because of the appeal of fresh fruit and because it is relatively low maintenance once planted. The pulp is used primarily in baked dessert recipes and for juicing fresh pawpaw drink or drink mixtures (pawpaw, pineapple, banana, lime, lemon and orange tea mix). In many recipes calling for bananas, pawpaw can be used with volumetric equivalency.</p>
<p>The commercial growing and harvesting of pawpaws is strong in southeast Ohio. The <a class="external text" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ohiopawpaw.com/">Ohio Pawpaw Growers&#8217; Association</a> annually sponsors the <a class="external text" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pawpawfest.com/">Ohio Pawpaw Festival</a> at Lake Snowden near <a title="Albany, Ohio" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_Ohio">Albany, Ohio</a>.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>But really the place to start with all of this is to pick your foods carefully. Find a butcher and get to know him or her. Look around and find local growers that you can trust. When you have to go to a modern grocery store go there with a certain amount of fear and suspicion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The public DEMANDS that the police investigate just about everything. The police DEMAND respect. College Professors always DEMAND respect. There was an awful lot of DEMANDING going on in the situation. The thing is I can sympathize with everyone involved. See before there was driving while BLACK, there was driving while HIPPIE.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPd4FmlpVxI"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPd4FmlpVxI</a></p>
<p>Anytime the police saw long hair, they presumed that there was drugs involved. My girlfriend had a nickname for me. She called me PC and it did not stand for politically correct. It stood for Probable Cause.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGhcECnWRGM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGhcECnWRGM </a></p>
<p>At that time I had a brother who rode around with me a lot. He did not like the police &#8211; he called them PIGS. So when I got pulled over and he was along he would start making PIG noises.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zU8LBnOJNxk"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zU8LBnOJNxk</a></p>
<p>So I wanted to &#8220;kill&#8221; them both because the situation was so stupid. I believe that is what Obama meant but did not say, that the situation was STUPID not the people involved because see when you call people stupid they go getting all there back up and stuff. So in that spirit the next several posts will look at things in the environment and energy world that I think are stupid. A list follows:</p>
<p>The phrase Global Warming</p>
<p>Burning things</p>
<p>Cars</p>
<p>Windows</p>
<p>Apples in Illinois in the Winter</p>
<p>Illegal drugs</p>
<p>My mother</p>
<p>Eating meat</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Since I owe Dan Piraro for letting me post his cartoons and I share his concerns, Let us start with the last one first. If we are going to admit that Burning Things is Stupid (more on that later) then we have to admit that there are only several sources of legitimate power. These are geothermal, tidal, wind and solar. Just to keep things simple while this is a lot of power it is still finite. ALL food is solar power. No Sun no food. So when we become rational and we may be in the process of doing that, would we eat meat? The answer is probably not. Here is Dan and the Washington Post&#8217;s take on it:</p>

<p>The debate over climate change has reached a rarefied level of policy abstraction in recent months. Carbon tax or cap-and-trade? Upstream or downstream? Should we auction permits? Head-scratching is, at this point, permitted. But at base, these policies aim to do a simple thing, in a simple way: persuade us to undertake fewer activities that are bad for the atmosphere by making those activities more expensive. Driving an SUV would become pricier. So would heating a giant house with coal and buying electricity from an inefficient power plant. But there&#8217;s one activity that&#8217;s not on the list and should be: eating a hamburger.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s any consolation, I didn&#8217;t like writing that sentence any more than you liked reading it. But the evidence is strong. It&#8217;s not simply that meat is a contributor to global warming; it&#8217;s that it is a huge contributor. Larger, by a significant margin, than the global transportation sector.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=20772&amp;Cr=global&amp;Cr1=environment">2006 United Nations report</a>, livestock accounts for 18 percent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. Some of meat&#8217;s contribution to climate change is intuitive. It&#8217;s more energy efficient to grow grain and feed it to people than it is to grow grain and turn it into feed that we give to calves until they become adults that we then slaughter to feed to people. Some of the contribution is gross. &#8220;Manure lagoons,&#8221; for instance, is the oddly evocative name for the acres of animal excrement that sit in the sun steaming nitrous oxide into the atmosphere. And some of it would make Bart Simpson chuckle. Cow gas &#8212; interestingly, it&#8217;s mainly burps, not farts &#8212; is a real player.</p>
<p>But the result isn&#8217;t funny at all: Two researchers at the University of Chicago estimated that <a href="http://geosci.uchicago.edu/%7Egidon/papers/nutri/nutriEI.pdf">switching to a vegan diet would have a bigger impact than trading in your gas guzzler for a Prius</a> (PDF). A <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/homepage/environment/2009/winter/wheres-the-beef.shtml">study out of Carnegie Mellon University</a> found that the average American would do less for the planet by switching to a totally local diet than by going vegetarian one day a week. That prompted Rajendra Pachauri, the head of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to recommend that people give up meat one day a week to take pressure off the atmosphere. The response was quick and vicious. &#8220;How convenient for him,&#8221; was the inexplicable reply from a columnist at the Pittsburgh Tribune Review. &#8220;He&#8217;s a vegetarian.&#8221;</p>

<p>(To make the cartoon big, click on the seagull&#8217;s left knee)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Bizarro is brought to you today by</span><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3285/2966785180_2c1f7fc533.jpg" style="color: #3333ff; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold"> Geriatric Mouse Voice.</a></p>
<p>Judging by the emails I got last week, this cartoon was very popular with <a href="http://networktrading.com/images/treehugger.jpg" style="color: #3333ff">environmentally conscious readers.</a> Destruction of ocean life is far worse than most people realize because it is hidden under the surface. It&#8217;s hard to get good photos of all that is missing from the sea. Most experts estimate that 90% of all large ocean life has been decimated in the past 100 years. <a href="http://sidesalad.net/archives/MontyPythonsMeaningOfLifeMrCreosoteItsOnlyWaferThin.jpg" style="color: #3333ff">Red Lobster All-You-Can-Eat night, anyone?</a></p>
<p>And judging by some emails I&#8217;ve gotten recently, there are a number of readers who think I hate fat people and think they are fair game for ridicule. My point is not that fat people are &#8220;funny&#8221; or &#8220;bad,&#8221; but that <a href="http://www.mybiblepictures.com/glutton12.jpg" style="color: #3333ff">human selfishness</a> is ruining the planet, with Americans firmly in the lead. I know it is hard to resist food, I&#8217;ve battled it myself, we all have. And we&#8217;re not the only species prone to this, we&#8217;ve all seen what happens to dogs when <a href="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/02_04/minniJW_468x431.jpg" style="color: #3333ff"><span style="color: #3333ff">too much food</span></a> is made available. For millions of years, humans couldn&#8217;t be certain when their next meal would be, so our genes evolved to tell us to eat all that is available, especially the fatty stuff.</p>

<p>If you want to see more of Dan just Google him. He is literally the first 10 entries. But this is my favorite Dan thingy&#8230;his live show:</p>

This isn&#8217;t one of my preachy environmental cartoons, it&#8217;s just an amusing visual about what what will happen to all those tiny islands we cartoonists draw in those <a style="color: #3333ff;" href="http://www.markstivers.com/wordpress/comics/2006-05-22%20Desert-island.gif">stranded-on-a-desert-island cartoons</a> we are so fond of, if indeed the sea level rises.</p>
<p>This is a scientifically researched and accurate representation of such a scenario; tiny islands <span style="font-style: italic;">would</span> disappear beneath the surface of the sea. Trees would pierce the surface in many instances, appearing to float. Caption balloons, being attached to their orator by the laws of graphics, would be at least partially obscured.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Or even the environment or residential energy conservation? Well Actually nothing but Dan lets me post a cartoon of his periodically here when I am completely out of ideas or when he is particularly brilliant which ever comes first. So when he asked his blog readers to reach out to media moguls and poobas to see if they might air a version of it like on Showtime or HBO I could not resist but first the toon:</p>
<p><a href="http://bizarrocomic.blogspot.com/">http://bizarrocomic.blogspot.com/</a></p>

<p>Now the Pitch:</p>

<h3 class="post-title entry-title"> <a href="http://bizarrocomic.blogspot.com/2009/05/comedy-show.html">COMEDY SHOW!!!</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.smarttix.com/show.aspx?showCode=CAR39" style="color: #3333ff; font-weight: bold">A RARE COMEDY EVENT COMING TO YOUR TOWN!!!</a><br />
(If your town is New York City.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m doing one of my increasingly rare comedy shows in NYC for an ENTIRE WEEK next month and I can&#8217;t bear the thought of going on unless <span style="font-style: italic">you&#8217;re</span> going to be there. Please don&#8217;t break my already fragile heart by saying, <span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;I can&#8217;t afford to fly all the way to New York From Seattle,&#8221;</span> or <span style="font-style: italic">&#8220;I wish I could be there but I&#8217;m in prison until 2019.&#8221;</span> What is more important to you? Your precious money or my flimsy ego? (Before you answer that, consider that I will give you an autograph when you come to the show, which you can then sell on eBay to offset $3-$4 of your airfare and hotel costs.)</p>
<p>Seriously, this is a big show for me. I do a talk or a short set now and then, most often on the West Coast, but I&#8217;m doing fewer of these long-form comedy shows all the time and this is a full week of performances off-Broadway in NYC, so there are a <span style="font-style: italic">lot</span> of seats to fill. Please come. If you can&#8217;t come, send someone you know in NYC to the show and tell them to tell me you said &#8220;hi.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the show, you&#8217;ll be able to meet me, Jason, and Matthew as we hang out in the lobby selling books, signing breasts, and pooping out witty ripostes like a member of the Algonquin Round Table. If you&#8217;re lucky, you might even meet CHNW!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smarttix.com/show.aspx?showCode=CAR39" style="color: #3333ff">Ticket info here. Hope to see you there!</a></p>

<p>So if you are the Chief Executive Officer of a cable channel like say:</p>
<p>Matt Blank</p>
<p>at Showtime</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Bill Nelson</p>
<p>at HBO</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Doug Herzog</p>
<p>at Comedy Central</p>
<p>or even</p>
<p>John Odoner</p>
<p>at JTV</p>
<p>Give these poor guys a break and send someone to their show. Thanks again Dan!<br />
