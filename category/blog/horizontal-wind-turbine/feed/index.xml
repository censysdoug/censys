<p>Here is a video peek:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now I will have to post a more desultory post about how to properly maintain a wind farm and what that costs. But they had some cool pictures of things like a Turbine House destroyed at 300 feet. Turbine blades dangling and swinging in the wind. Everyone called it DANGERous. But here is the more mundane side of things. What the bad boys should have been doing.</p>

</div>
<div class="entry">
<p>After doing some research on renewable energy systems or alternative energy systems as many will call them, I wanted to get the information out there as far as the advantages and disadvantages of the 2 main renewable energy systems, <a title="wind turbine generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind turbine generators</a> and <a title="photovoltaic solar panels" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">photovoltaic solar panels</a>.</p>
<p>Both <a title="solar panel" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panel</a> and <a title="wind generator systems" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator systems</a> are similar as far as how they are setup. You can have the <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> grid tied or off grid, same as <a title="solar panels" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panels</a>. Both the <a title="solar panel photovoltaic panel" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panel (photovoltaic panel)</a> and <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> will need a battery bank if you are using an off grid system. Both of these renewable energy systems will produce clean energy and help the environment as well as save you money in your home!</p>
<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Wind Generator Systems and Solar Panel Systems</h3>
<p>Now onto some of the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative energy system. None of this information is from my own personal experience as I do not have the financial funds to support the research. So the information about these renewable energy systems have came from researching the internet, talking to people that have these alternative energy systems, and of course some calculations of my own (prices, efficiency, etc.).</p>
<h3>Wind Turbine Generator System Pros and Cons</h3>
<p>The main advantage of <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> is that they can produce electricity day or night as long as there is wind. <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">Wind generators</a> need less space on your land to produce sufficient electricity. <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">Wind generators</a> are able to produce more electric for the same price. If you spend $1,000.00 on <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> you can produce 1kW – 2kW, with <a title="solar panels" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panels</a> you may only produce around .5kW – .75kW with the same $1,000.00. <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generators" target="_blank">Wind generators</a> have moving parts, so there is always wear and tear on these moving parts. Bearings can go bad, propeller blades can be struck by objects, and heat may be generated. Your <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> will be installed on a tower or pole of some sort to gain height where there is more wind, allowing lighting to possibly strike your <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a>. As wind hits the propeller blades there will be noise created, think of a fan and how they sound, or even taking a rope and swinging it fast in circles. You will get some of this noise from your <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a>. The propellers of the <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> can also produce shadows flickering. Birds can get killed from flying into your wind generator’s propellers. There are vertical <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generators</a> which will prevent this. So the quick break down of the <a title="wind generator system" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator system</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sj-r.com/opinion/20160419/michelle-knox-illinois-must-act-now-to-fix-its-clean-energy-policies/?Start=1">http://www.sj-r.com/opinion/20160419/michelle-knox-illinois-must-act-now-to-fix-its-clean-energy-policies/?Start=1</a></p>
<h1>Michelle Knox: Illinois must act now to fix its clean energy policies</h1>
<p>Posted Apr. 19, 2016 at 10:05 PM</p>
<blockquote><p>In 1970, more than 20 million people worldwide took part in the first Earth Day. Millions more will take part in Earth Day 2016.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>As someone who delivers both wind and solar energy to customers in Central Illinois, I can attest to the need to fix Illinois&#8217; energy policy — and quickly. I plan to be among those participating in a rally at the state Capitol in Springfield this week, during which we will deliver a strong message to Illinois leaders: by the time Earth Day 2017 arrives, it is critical that Illinois will have taken steps to reform our state&#8217;s out-of-date energy policies or we will lose clean energy jobs to other states.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Any day that goes by — let alone another year — without such a fix puts our state at risk of losing out on jobs and investments in this competitive field.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Fortunately, lawmakers have the chance to bolster our clean energy economy at the time we need it most. The Illinois Clean Jobs Bill (SB1485/ HB2607) would create more than 32,000 jobs and deliver more than $1.6 billion in savings to electricity consumers, while making vast improvements in public health. This bipartisan legislation would double the current standards for energy efficiency while increasing the targets for electricity generated by renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, to 35 percent by 2030, up from the current target of 25 percent by 2025.</p></blockquote>

<h1 class="xlHeader">Here&#8217;s What Warren Buffett Thinks About Renewable Energy</h1>
<p><span class="vcard byline">By <a class="qsAdd qs-source-iapsitlnk0000002" href="http://my.fool.com/profile/elihpaudio/info.aspx?source=iapsitlnk0000002"><span itemprop="author">Jason Hall</span></a> | <a class="qsAdd qs-source-iapsitlnk0000003" href="http://www.fool.com/author/2130/index.aspx?source=iapsitlnk0000003">More Articles</a> </span><br />

<p><em>&#8220;Rule No. 1: Never Lose Money. Rule No. 2: Never Forget Rule No. 1.&#8221;<br />
</em>&#8211;Warren Buffett</p>
<p>Warren Buffett is famous for both his legendary investing acumen, and his simple, straightforward investing advice. For years, alternative energy has been viewed as non-competitive with traditional energy production from coal and other fossil fuels, making them money-losers for most investors.</p>
<p>Buffett&#8217;s own <strong>Berkshire Hathaway </strong> (<span class="ticker">NYSE: <a class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001" href="http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/BRK-B.aspx?source=isssitthv0000001" data-id="206602">BRK-B</a></span> <a class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010" title="Add BRK-B to My Watchlist" href="http://my.fool.com/watchlist/add?ticker=BRK-B&amp;source=iwlsitbut0000010"> </a>) subsidiary MidAmerican Energy is heavily investing in alternative energy sources, including both wind and solar. And considering that MidAmerican produces more than $1.2 billion in annual &#8220;ammo&#8221; for Buffett&#8217;s &#8220;elephant gun,&#8221; the story on renewables is clearly changing.</p>
<p>Should investors follow the Oracle into &#8220;green energy&#8221; to make more greenbacks? Let&#8217;s take a look.</p>
<p>MidAmerican has been investing in wind energy for a decade, and is easily the largest producer of wind energy in North America; wind actually accounts for more than 30% of the company&#8217;s total energy generation capacity. Current projects will move the total to almost 40%.</p>
<p>MidAmerican has relied on both <strong>General Electric</strong>  (<span class="ticker">NYSE: <a class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001" href="http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/GE.aspx?source=isssitthv0000001" data-id="203664">GE</a></span> <a class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010" title="Add GE to My Watchlist" href="http://my.fool.com/watchlist/add?ticker=GE&amp;source=iwlsitbut0000010"> </a>) and <strong>Vestas </strong> (<span class="ticker">NASDAQOTH: <a class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001" href="http://caps.fool.com/Ticker/VWDRY.aspx?source=isssitthv0000001" data-id="221845">VWDRY</a></span> <a class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010" title="Add VWDRY to My Watchlist" href="http://my.fool.com/watchlist/add?ticker=VWDRY&amp;source=iwlsitbut0000010"> </a>) for wind turbines for different projects. A large project in California, which deployed more than 300 megawatts of power generating capacity, featured 100 Vestas wind turbines. GE&#8217;s turbines, on the other hand, are the most commonly used in MidAmerican&#8217;s fleet</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is so bogus. Wind Farms are seen as a &#8220;burden&#8221; on the community so money is made available from the government to compensate individual households. I do not really know how dollars are changed into pounds but lets call it 70%. That would mean that any household in the US would be eligible for 650 $$$ per year for being near a wind farm. That amounts to what?  Redistribution of tax income or is this actually a subsidy? Hard to tell but here it is:</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/archives/33978">http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/archives/33978</a></p>
<h1 class="entry-title">The government’s planned compensation to households near new wind-farm developments may not be enough</h1>
<p><em>The government this week announced a plan to compensate households near new wind-farm developments to incentivise them to accept them.</em><strong> Steve Gibbons</strong><em>, discussing provisional findings from on-going research, suggests that the level of compensation may not cover the costs involved.</em></p>
<p>News yesterday morning suggests that communities near new wind-farm developments could be in for some form of compensation, through lower electricity prices or other payment schemes. The BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22791815">reports</a> that the compensation could be worth as much as £100,000 per community. This is probably welcome news for residents potentially affected by wind-farm developments, although <i>provisional</i> findings from on-going research suggests that this level of compensation may not cover the costs involved, in terms of environmental, health and other impacts. I find that an operational wind farm reduces housing prices by around 7% up to 5km from the wind farm site. Some rough calculations based on these estimates suggest that the implied social costs on the local community (within 5km) amounts to about £80 million per operational wind farm, or about £500 per household per year.</p>
<p>An extended (user friendly) abstract of the research follows below:</p>
<p>Renewable energy technology has potential global environmental benefits in terms of reduced CO2 emissions and slower depletion of natural energy resources. However, like most power generation and transmission infrastructure, the plant, access services and transmission equipment associated with renewable electricity generation may involve environmental costs. This is particularly so in the case of wind turbine developments, where the sites that are optimal in terms of energy efficiency are typically in rural, coastal and wilderness locations that offer many natural environmental amenities. These natural amenities include the aesthetic appeal of landscape, outdoor recreational opportunities and the existence values of wilderness habitats. In addition, for residents local to operational wind turbines have reported health effects related to noise and visual disturbances.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>They even site the old &#8220;health related issues&#8221; which have never been proven to exist. Go there and read. More next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since we are in a Utility state of mind this week, the PSC of Michigan just released this report according to the folks at AWEA.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.awea.org/blog/index.cfm?customel_dataPageID_1699=14546">http://www.awea.org/blog/index.cfm?customel_dataPageID_1699=14546</a></p>
<h4>Mich. Public Service Commission: Renewable energy cheaper than coal</h4>
<div>Posted: 2012-03-02 Tom Gray</div>
<p>We often run &#8220;Fact check&#8221; articles on this blog when  fossil-fuel-funded &#8220;experts&#8221; exaggerate the cost of electricity  generated with wind power (for a particularly bald-faced recent example,  see <a href="http://www.awea.org/blog/index.cfm?customel_dataPageID_1699=14520">Fact check: American Enterprise Institute epic FAIL on study of wind costs</a>, Feb. 29), but perhaps this one should be titled &#8220;Reality check.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reality: the Michigan Public Service Commission (PSC) recently issued a  report that finds that electricity generated from renewable energy  sources, at an average cost of $91 per megawatt-hour (9.1  cents/kilowatt-hour), is almost one-third cheaper than the cost of  electricity from a new coal-fired power plant ($133 per MWh, or 13.3  cents/kWh).</p>
<p>Further, the report notes, &#8220;The actual cost of renewable energy  contracts submitted to the Commission to date shows a downward pricing  trend.  This was the case as of the filing of this report in February of  2011 and continues to be the case, as <strong>the two most recent contracts approved by the Commission for new wind capacity have levelized costs of $61-$64 per MWh</strong>.  This is significantly lower than the levelized costs of the first wind contracts submitted in 2009.&#8221; (emphasis added)</p>
<p>The report is one in a series required annually from the Commission to  the state legislature, reporting on the impact of the state&#8217;s Renewable  Energy Standard (RES), which requires utilities to obtain 10 percent of  the electricity they provide from renewable energy sources by 2015.</p>
<p>Other highlights from the report:</p>
<p>&#8211; While utilities are allowed to charge customers extra for renewable  energy, customers are also seeing savings due to wind.  Said the  Commission, &#8220;While &#8230; surcharges have an impact on electric rates,  there are also economic benefits attributable to an increase in  renewable energy generation sources and improved energy efficiency. As  noted in previous sections, the cost of energy generated by renewable  sources continues to decline and is cheaper than new coal-fired  generation.</p>

<h1><span style="color: #2a0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DIY Green Energy | Home Made Energy</span></span></h1>
<p><img decoding="async" title="diy green energy for homes" src="http://diygreenenergyforhomes.com/images/diygreenenergywindpower.jpg" border="0" alt="diy green energy for homes" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />Are you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sick and tired</span> of having to pay <span style="text-decoration: underline;">huge energy      bills</span>? If you answer yes to this question, then DIY green energy is a sensible option for you. You can      begin utilizing free, eco-friendly power and <a href="http://diygreenenergyforhomes.com/How-to-Save-Money-At-Home.html">reduce your household      power bill</a> by more than 80% while doing your part in saving the Earth.</p>
<p>The most significant benefits of DIY green energy is the ability to make big savings in the long run. Bear in mind though that there are significant start up costs associated with the setting up of solar, magnetic or wind power, and it&#8217;ll require a bit of time before you start to enjoy the rewards.</p>
<p>Setting up green energy power is really an enjoyable task that can be done by yourself &#8211; there is no better satisfaction than the experience associated with getting this done yourself. The very first time I assembled a <a href="http://diygreenenergyforhomes.com/Wind-Turbine/">residential wind turbine</a> involved a couple of weeks, however the thrill of seeing it working in motion is priceless.</p>
<p>There are numerous methods to construct your own homemade green energy generators online which depicts the procedure and show you which components are needed. Don’t ever doubt yourself and don&#8217;t forget that anyone can create a workable and effective machine by yourself.</p>
<p>If you wish to reduce your month-to-month electricity bill, become self sufficient or increase the value of your property, this is all merely an arm’s reach away using homemade energy. It is possible to construct DIY solar panels or wind power generator by using simple, straightforward, &#8220;any kid could understand it&#8221; instructions. We&#8217;ve placed together some terrific information on <a href="http://diygreenenergyforhomes.com/Solar-Panel/">DIY solar panels</a> and <a href="http://diygreenenergyforhomes.com/Wind-Turbine/">homemade wind turbines</a> that will make a massive difference in saving energy if you put them into application.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you&#8217;ve questions on home made green energy or don&#8217;t have the slightess idea what is green energy, we have answers for you here. Before you know it, your free electricity dreams will turn out to be a reality.</p>
