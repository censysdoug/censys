										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While I have always said the storage is NOT the problem in renewable energy because you can always pump something like water or air during good times and discharge it in bad times. The storage of energy in moving things was always gonna be a problem and batteries were only an interim solution. Now some people are getting a handle on this problem, and I am supper EXCITED about it. This article is real techincal. Sorry.</p>

<dd id="abstract">Researchers have produced a structural battery that performs ten times better than all previous versions.

<p id="first" class="lead">Researchers from Chalmers University of Technology have produced a structural battery that performs ten times better than all previous versions. It contains carbon fibre that serves simultaneously as an electrode, conductor, and load-bearing material. Their latest research breakthrough paves the way for essentially &#8216;massless&#8217; energy storage in vehicles and other technology.</p>
<div id="text">
<p>The batteries in today&#8217;s electric cars constitute a large part of the vehicles&#8217; weight, without fulfilling any load-bearing function. A structural battery, on the other hand, is one that works as both a power source and as part of the structure &#8212; for example, in a car body. This is termed &#8216;massless&#8217; energy storage, because in essence the battery&#8217;s weight vanishes when it becomes part of the load-bearing structure. Calculations show that this type of multifunctional battery could greatly reduce the weight of an electric vehicle.</p>
<p>The development of structural batteries at Chalmers University of Technology has proceeded through many years of research, including previous discoveries involving certain types of carbon fibre. In addition to being stiff and strong, they also have a good ability to store electrical energy chemically. This work was named by Physics World as one of 2018&#8217;s ten biggest scientific breakthroughs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Her is why I say that Airplanes are the prime culprits of Global Warming. First: They Fly High. While fossil fueled Power Plants and Surface Transport Fleets emit huge green house gases many of them are mitigated before they can have much of a green house effect. But most jets fly right up there. I mean even some prop planes do too.</p>
<p>Second: The Fuel. Especially military flight fuel is bloody near kerosene.</p>
<p>Third: There are so many. It may be a myth but after 911 when so many planes were grounded the tempeture dropped a degree.</p>
<p>So this is kinda cool. Maybe we should call them personal air taxi&#8217;s or something. Yes they will be expensive. So what.</p>

<p id="khu5UD">It’s becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the fact that air travel is a massive and growing problem for the global climate.</p>
<p id="e0cf0M">In the US, transportation is now the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, and aircraft account for <a href="https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/regulations-greenhouse-gas-emissions-aircraft">12 percent</a> of transportation emissions. <a href="https://www.bts.dot.gov/newsroom/2018-traffic-data-us-airlines-and-foreign-airlines-us-flights">US air travel</a> reached a record high last year, pushing up overall <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/1/8/18174082/us-carbon-emissions-2018">emissions</a> even while the power sector saw a decline.</p>
<p id="P7RqPM">To make matters worse, demand for flights is growing. Emissions from air travel are poised to spike up to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/transport/aviation_en">sevenfold</a> globally by 2050 if nothing else changes.</p>
<p id="w6PQSS">That’s why it’s so urgent to decarbonize air travel. Yet the technical challenges are immense. Alternatives like carbon-neutral biofuels remain far too costly. And the stodgy rules in the heavily regulated, risk-averse aviation sector lag far behind advances in electric drivetrains.</p>

<p>They are currently flying small electric planes on a regional basis.</p>

<p>Starting this month, Nissan has begun offering rebuilt battery packs for the older Leafs, filling a gap for drivers of older cars whose packs have begun to run down.</p>
<p>The company built a new facility in Japan to rebuild the packs, and will sell them for about $2,850 (based on the price in Japan), <a href="https://insideevs.com/nissan-introduces-refabricated-batteries-for-older-leaf-in-japan-from-new-4r-plant/">according to <em>Inside EVs.</em></a> A Nissan spokesman told Green Car Reports that the company is investigating offering the program in the United States, but has not yet made a decision.</p>
<p>Electric car repair trainer Craig Van Batenburg, of the Automotive Career Development Center in Worcester, Massachusetts, said the refurbished battery packs are new among electric carmakers. Previously, older battery packs had to be replaced with new ones, which cost more than $6,500 (minus a $1,000 trade-in, or core charge, on the old battery pack.)</p>
<p>The cost covers the 24-kwh battery pack in the original Leaf, which was rated at only 73 miles of range when new.</p>
<p>Owners of early Leafs had problems with the cars losing range after only a year or two in hot climates such as Phoenix, Arizona.</p>

I would say the technology would have been different and the work harder, but it could have been done. Still I am so proud of Renault and I hope more companies try this out. GO Renault!</p>

<p>Renault has launched a &#8220;smart island&#8221; in Portugal that uses its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/23/renault-zoe-impressions-ev-charging-network-paris-france/#/">Zoe electric vehicle</a>, home batteries, smart charging and vehicle-to-grid (V2E) energy storage to run without fossil fuels. The idea is to make the Madeira island of Porto Santo energy independent and stimulate renewable energy production. &#8220;[We want] to build a model that can be carried over to other islands and cities,&#8221; Renault Electric Vehicle Director Eric Feunteun told Engadget.</p>

<p>Unlike Tesla&#8217;s massive Powerpack installation, the Renault project is more of a community endeavor on the small (16 square mile) and sparsely populated (5,483 inhabitants), tourism-oriented island. It will unroll in three phases: In the first, 20 fortunate Porto Santo volunteers will get 14 Zoes and six Kango Z.E. utility vans to use every day. They&#8217;ll benefit from 40 new connected public and private charging stations set up by Renault and local utility Empresa de Electricitade da Madeira (EEM).</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s say you come home from work at 7 PM with a decent charge left, and only need two to three hours of charging,&#8221; said Feunteun. &#8220;The smart charging system we&#8217;re testing will decide when the best time to do that is, based on usage, energy availability and other factors. Then, it can charge up to eight times a day in chunks as small as 15 minutes.&#8221;</p>

<h1>Feature: China and the New Energy Economy</h1>
<div class="clr"></div>
<p class="commondate">London (Platts)&#8211;31 Oct 2017 1239 pm EDT/1639 GMT</p>
<p>There is an increasingly inescapable sense that an energy transition of enormous proportions is taking place. The number of &#8216;bans&#8217; announced on Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles is growing, even if governments are placing them relatively far out on the political horizon.</p>
<p>More and more car manufacturers are taking note and shifting R&amp;D spending into Electric Vehicles (EVs), a move which has profound implications for the development curves, and thus future cost, of EVs versus ICE vehicles.</p>
<p>In October, US automaker General Motors said that it would launch two new pure electric models in 2018 and a further 18 by 2023.</p>
<p>Its competitor Ford announced the creation of a new internal team to &#8220;think big and move fast&#8221; in order to accelerate the electrification of its auto production. Both are some way behind their European counterparts.</p>
<p>It is not hard to see why such decisions are being made now. While the number of EVs on the road remains just a fraction of the total parc, global sales are growing by about 40% year-on-year, making EVs the biggest growth story in the auto market in decades.</p>
<p>And, if governments are going to regulate against ICE vehicles and subsidize EVs, thereby changing the consumer choices which otherwise might be made, then what other path is there to tread?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The news only gets better for renewables. Wind did not keep pace with Solar but wind had a huge head start. Coal is fading in the rear view mirror and natural gas is neck and neck. I think the US is finally catching on, but you can bet the first things Trump will go after will be subsidies and the EPA.</p>

<p>Renewable-energy growth has accelerated in 2016, but this may go down as a milestone year for one renewable-energy <span class="vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default"><span class="vm-hook">source</span></span> in particular.</p>
<p>Together, all renewable-energy sources are expected to account for 8 percent of U.S. electricity-generation capacity in 2017, according to the Department of Energy, and solar energy is responsible for most of that growth.</p>
<p>For the first time ever, new solar-generating capacity is expected to exceed new generating capacity for wind and natural gas.</p>

<p>The final tally won&#8217;t be available until March, but enough new solar installations were expected to be completed in 2016 <a title="Solar Looks to Outpace Natural Gas and Wind" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/solar-looks-to-outpace-natural-gas-and-wind/" target="_blank">to outpace wind and natural gas</a>, according to <em>Scientific American</em>.</p>
<p>A total of 9.5 gigawatts of solar-generating capacity were expected to be built in 2016, tripling the amount installed in 2015, the magazine said, citing Energy Department data.</p>
<p>That amount would exceed the anticipated 8.0 GW of natural gas capacity, and 6.8 GW of wind capacity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I never really thought about cars this way before. It seems the more they HELP you drive the more expensive and complicated they are. If the car drives you, it will have a very complicated electronics system but a pretty simple structure. This would mean a much cheaper car and a radically restructured automobile industry.</p>

<p>Would you be okay with your car bossing you around if it saved you fuel, and therefore money? Bosch is hoping that you won&#8217;t mind a few extra pointers on the road with its new <a href="http://www.bosch-mobility-solutions.com/en/connected-mobility/active-gas-pedal/" target="_blank" data-s-object-id="articleBody" data-component="externalLink">active gas pedal</a>, which the company believes can decrease fuel consumption by 7 percent.</p>
<p>Of course, creating a smart gas pedal is a complicated endeavor. By connecting to a vehicle&#8217;s various electronic systems, it can use haptic feedback (Bosch mentions vibration, knocking and variable pedal resistance) to tell the driver when to shift, when to cut back on wasteful acceleration and even when a hybrid vehicle is about to switch from electric- to gas-based propulsion.</p>
<p>While going green is a big part of this new pedal, there&#8217;s also a safety angle to it. Not only can the pedal be linked to active safety systems like forward collision warning or parking sensors, but it could also connect to the navigation system to prevent drivers from taking corners with too much <em>chutzpah</em>. And once vehicle-to-vehicle technology becomes common, the pedal can be used to warn drivers of upcoming hazards like potholes or stopped vehicles.</p>

<h1>Natural gas wins place as oil field fuel</h1>
<h5 title="2012-09-27T20:56:48Z">By Zain Shauk | Thursday, September 27, 2012</h5>
<p>The biggest, baddest engines in the world, long chained to diesel fuel, are on the verge of a mass transformation because of cheap natural gas &#8211; with oil field equipment holding particular potential, executives said Thursday during a summit of heavy fuel users and producers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the first reason that large engines are going gas,&#8221; said Joel<em>Feucht, director of gas engine strategy for Caterpillar&#8217;s energy and power systems division. &#8220;Large engines burn the most fuel. I could try to make it harder, but that&#8217;s pretty straightforward.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>Oil companies alone use nearly 1.2 billion gallons of diesel fuel a year just for pressure pumping equipment that supports hydraulic fracturing, said <a href="http://www.chron.com/?controllerName=search&amp;action=search&amp;channel=business&amp;search=1&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;query=%22David+Hill%22">David Hill</a>, vice president of natural gas economy operations for Encana Corp. Adding the diesel used to power drilling rigs themselves, the total is more than 2.8 billion gallons annually, said Pierce Dehring, a project engineer for Baker Hughes.</em></p>
