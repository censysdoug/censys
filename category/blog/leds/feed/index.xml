<ul>
<li><em>Throughout 2018, efforts to protect habitats and conserve threatened species were driven by governments, scientists, NGOs and indigenous communities.</em></li>
<li><em>The world pledged more conservation funding to protect the oceans, while protections for coastal ecosystems were also boosted.</em></li>
<li><em>Conservation initiatives steered by indigenous communities continue to garner attention and praise, not least because they tend to be more sustainable and effective than top-down programs.</em></li>
<li><em>These were among the upbeat, happy environmental and conservation stories we reported on in 2018.</em></li>

<p>“I like to envision the whole world as a jigsaw puzzle with all the pieces of puzzle scattered all over the place. If you look at the whole picture it is overwhelming and terrifying, but if you work on your little part of the jigsaw and know that people all over the world are working on their little bits of it, that’s what will give you hope,” Jane Goodall, the world-renowned primatologist and conservationist and Mongabay adviser, says in a <a href="https://web.facebook.com/janegoodall/posts/i-like-to-envision-the-whole-world-as-a-jigsaw-puzzle-with-all-the-pieces-of-the/10155236692247171/?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr" target="_blank" rel="external noopener" data-wpel-link="external">post on her Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>Hope for global conservation is what we wish to evoke in our readers with some of the more upbeat environmental stories from the past year that we have pieced together from around the world in this list. These include some of your favorite happy stories, from the expansion of protected areas for wildlife, cancelled reclamation projects that posed coastal ecosystem threats, to the impactful role of indigenous communities in conservation.</p>
<h3><strong>1. More protection for wildlife corridors</strong></h3>

<p>On a housekeeping note, websites contact me all the time to say, you cite this source: this one is better or more up-to-date or broken and here we fixed it. they want inserted in the actual Blog post that relates directly to their &#8220;improvement&#8221;. I AM ONE guy. I can neither verify what they say is true OR get in edit mode and go back in time for years. So, I am going to post them here as addenda. Click on them and see what surprise you get.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I saw you mentioned the Wikipedia guide to led lights on your page:</p>
<p><a href="/censys/date/2015/01">/censys/date/2015/01</a></p>
<p>That’s a great resource. In fact, it inspired me to create my own guide here:</p>

I would say the technology would have been different and the work harder, but it could have been done. Still I am so proud of Renault and I hope more companies try this out. GO Renault!</p>

<p>Renault has launched a &#8220;smart island&#8221; in Portugal that uses its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/23/renault-zoe-impressions-ev-charging-network-paris-france/#/">Zoe electric vehicle</a>, home batteries, smart charging and vehicle-to-grid (V2E) energy storage to run without fossil fuels. The idea is to make the Madeira island of Porto Santo energy independent and stimulate renewable energy production. &#8220;[We want] to build a model that can be carried over to other islands and cities,&#8221; Renault Electric Vehicle Director Eric Feunteun told Engadget.</p>

<p>Unlike Tesla&#8217;s massive Powerpack installation, the Renault project is more of a community endeavor on the small (16 square mile) and sparsely populated (5,483 inhabitants), tourism-oriented island. It will unroll in three phases: In the first, 20 fortunate Porto Santo volunteers will get 14 Zoes and six Kango Z.E. utility vans to use every day. They&#8217;ll benefit from 40 new connected public and private charging stations set up by Renault and local utility Empresa de Electricitade da Madeira (EEM).</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s say you come home from work at 7 PM with a decent charge left, and only need two to three hours of charging,&#8221; said Feunteun. &#8220;The smart charging system we&#8217;re testing will decide when the best time to do that is, based on usage, energy availability and other factors. Then, it can charge up to eight times a day in chunks as small as 15 minutes.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am a graduate of Sangamon State University. What is now University of Illinois Springfield. They just build a Student Union and I am so proud of it. It could be LEED certified and it is student centered. Our Student Union was in a temporary building 0n the temporary campus &#8220;down the hill&#8221;. This is just so cool.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rGKhFojmcy"><p><a href="https://www.uis.edu/advancement/choose/student-union/strategic-design/">Strategic Design of the UIS Student Union</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://www.uis.edu/advancement/choose/student-union/strategic-design/embed/#?secret=rGKhFojmcy" data-secret="rGKhFojmcy" width="584" height="329" title="&#8220;Strategic Design of the UIS Student Union&#8221; &#8212; Office of Advancement" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>This is the part I like:</p>
<h3>Environmentally Excellent</h3>
<p>UIS is seeking a LEED Gold certificate (Leadership in Energy &amp; Environmental Design, awarded by the U.S. Green Building Council), both for the sake of the environment and in order to take advantage of energy saving measures. For this reason, the building will have a green, or “living,” roof with vegetation and a growing medium over a sloped membrane. This roof will provide insulation, help to lower air temperatures, and last much longer than other roofs—50 to 60 years rather than the 20 to 30 years most roofs last. The vegetation will most likely include wildflowers that will change throughout the growing season, adding to the building’s beauty.</p>
<p>To reduce storm runoff and eliminate water irrigation, the Student Union will have a rainwater reclamation system that takes advantage of the roof’s slope. Also in consideration of LEED approvals, lighting will be designed to meet the USGBC’s very stringent requirements.</p>

<p>Go there and read. More next week.</p>

<p class="descender" data-wc="134">     Mark and Sara Borkowski live with their two young daughters in a century-old, fifteen-hundred-square-foot house in Rutland, Vermont. Mark drives a school bus, and Sara works as a special-ed teacher; the cost of heating and cooling their house through the year consumes a large fraction of their combined income. Last summer, however, persuaded by Green Mountain Power, the main electric utility in Vermont, the Borkowskis decided to give their home an energy makeover. In the course of several days, coördinated teams of contractors stuffed the house with new insulation, put in a heat pump for the hot water, and installed two air-source heat pumps to warm the home. They also switched all the light bulbs to L.E.D.s and put a small solar array on the slate roof of the garage.</p>
<p data-wc="117">The Borkowskis paid for the improvements, but the utility financed the charges through their electric bill, which fell the very first month. Before the makeover, from October of 2013 to January of 2014, the Borkowskis used thirty-four hundred and eleven kilowatt-hours of electricity and three hundred and twenty-five gallons of fuel oil. From October of 2014 to January of 2015, they used twenty-eight hundred and fifty-six kilowatt-hours of electricity and no oil at all. President Obama has announced that by 2025 he wants the United States to reduce its total carbon footprint by up to twenty-eight per cent of 2005 levels. The Borkowskis reduced the footprint of their house by eighty-eight per cent in a matter of days, and at no net cost.</p>
