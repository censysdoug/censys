										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know it has been awhile since I did a residential post. I know this started out as a blog about residential energy needs and services. You know, energy efficient roofs, HVAC equipment and other such stuff. But years ago, I got off on energy related environmental stuff and then eventually Global Warming. Then anti-Nuclear stuff. Finally just raw Environmental stuff like obnoxious polluting and horrible deaths. Well today a gentleman named Chris Winters reached out and touched me so I am touching him back, so to speak. As always, I can vouch for his tips because they are somewhat general, but anything specific he is pitching I can not (For instance AC controllers &#8211; which his company sells). Also I may have put up this as an addenda to any earlier piece, so if i did forgive me.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cielowigle.com/blog/energy-saving-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.cielowigle.com/blog/energy-saving-tips/</a></p>
<p>No matter what the season, energy usage tends to increase one way or another. With long running air conditioning and increased wash cycles of sweaty laundry in summer, to high heating usage and wash cycles of bulkier laundry in winter, we simply cannot operate without electricity.</p>
<p>We can be extremely energy efficient and follow energy saving tips and tricks to ingrain some environmentally friendly habits.</p>
<p>Following energy saving tips is essential to lower your costs, but it is also important to decrease your ecological footprint.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/2020/08/generation-green-is-leading-the-sustainability-agenda/">millennials and Gen Z nicknamed “generation green”</a>, there is a strong focus on energy saving, and rightly so. However, global warming is rising more rapidly than ever, and the term ‘climate emergency’ is being used rather than climate change to highlight the situation’s intensity.</p>
<p>All industries such as <a href="https://www.cielowigle.com/blog/climate-change/">HVAC are revolutionizing their technology to act on climate change</a>. Since home appliances and devices are a major contributor to our energy consumption, utilizing smart devices such as smart thermostats or <a href="https://www.cielowigle.com/">smart controllers for air conditioners</a> can make a huge difference on your bills!</p>
<p>Let’s get right to it. Here are 21 energy saving tips that can easily help you decrease your energy consumption:</p>
<h2 id="h-1-use-energy-efficient-appliances">1. Use Energy Efficient Appliances</h2>
<p>Energy efficient appliances are specially designed to consume minimum energy to complete the same tasks that you’d perform with normal appliances.  In addition, some</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every once in awhile I return to CES&#8217; residential roots. So, here is another pass. You know what I say in these situations &#8211; Buyer Beware. This site looks really really good. I think it is sexy that it is a nonprofit organization. But I have never used this organization. I am a homeowner who has made very little in the way of energy IMPROVEments &#8211; insulation, metal roof and efficient air conditioner but the furnace in my house is 20 years old. Nonetheless these people look cool.</p>
<p><a href="https://zeroenergyproject.org/our-mission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://zeroenergyproject.org/our-mission/</a></p>
<p><strong>The Zero Energy Project is a non-profit educational organization whose goal is to help home buyers, builders, designers, and real estate professionals take meaningful steps</strong> towards radically reducing carbon emissions and energy bills by building zero net energy homes and near zero energy homes. We envision the day when positive energy homes, which produce more energy than they consume, will power electric vehicles as well as homes, so that everyone can live well with less expense and without fear of energy price spikes, while greatly reducing our carbon emissions.</p>
<div id="" class="col-sm-12 full-standard nobg slate cover">
<div class=" withtitle">
<div class="content withtitle">
<div class="singlecolumn">
<h3>The mission of the Zero Energy Project is to provide information and education to prospective home buyers, builders, designers, real estate professionals and advocates about zero net energy homes and to advance the prevalence of these homes in the mainstream housing market. We seek to facilitate connections between industry professionals and buyers, remove perceived barriers to entry, and provide resources to people from all walks of life, empowering action towards a robust zero energy built environment.</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First off, spell check does not like the word tankless. You would think by now that the people at WORD Press would have gotten over that spelling by now. Second off (to be consistent) this is not and article that CES can defend or debate. It is an article generated by another site so &#8220;Buyer Beware&#8221;. The articles has a lot of extraneous Ads and unnecessary clutter. Please feel free to ignore all of that. I have read the article and for the most part it is factual, and more extensive then most. So with out further ado:</p>

<div class="entry-content">
<p>Water heaters are extremely important to your <a href="https://happydiyhome.com/best-drain-cleaner/">plumbing system</a>, and this goes for both residential buildings and commercial spaces. Many people are turning to newer options, and this can lead you to wonder what a tankless water heater costs because this style of water heater will only heat up the water you use. Traditionally, water heaters heated and stored water on a continuous basis, and this can be expensive if you use a lot of water. As long as they get installed and connected correctly, it’s easy to control your tankless water heater cost for years at a time.</p>
<p>You get the choice of a single point unit or whole house units. A single point unit is slightly more inexpensive to buy and install because you put them right next to a water source. Whole house units cost more to install, but they are powerful enough to heat all of the water in your home at one time. The tankless water heater cost has a slightly wider price range due to a variety of the factors, and it starts at $2,000 and goes up to around $4,500 from start to finish.</p>
<p>The average cost is right around $2,800 for a whole house gas unit. The tankless water heater cost has fluctuating labor rates too. The flow rate, brand, and type will also influence your tankless water heater cost, and this is why you want to get a few estimates before you settle on one company to perform the installation. This can help ensure that you get a fair price with professional-quality results.</p>

They have a composting toilet and solar panels so they got the TOP and the BOTTOM covered hahahaha. The sleeping loft is amazing. I would prefer a king bed but i sure you could get it in if it was part of the early design. They do live outside alot but there is nothing wrong with that. That would not work in an Illinois winter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little house for me is 800 square feet. That&#8217;s what my wife and I have if you discount the storage space and the plant room in the basement. During the spring, summer, and fall months, we spend a lot of time outdoors in are yard or up until March doing other things in other spaces. Whether its an apartment or a rental house, that&#8217;s pretty much the way I have always been. Whether there were one of me or two of us.</p>
<p>The idea that small is better has always seemed to be suspect to me. Anyway, here is one take on the down side of a Tiny House. And yes, I still believe Small is Beautiful.</p>

<p class="body">Tiny houses are everywhere. They’ve received heavy <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2018/04/03/small-but-not-tiny-homes/484295002/">coverage</a> in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jun/26/tiny-home-communities-housing-solution-or-gentrified-trailer-parks">the media</a> and there are <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tinyhousemovement/?hl=en">millions</a> of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tinyhouse/?hl=en">followers</a> on dozens of pages on social media. While there is no census for these homes, they have seen a surge in popularity in the decade since the Great Recession – witness the <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/article/tiny-house-maker-legacy-housing-sets-terms-for-41-million-ipo-cm1063239">prolific growth</a> of tiny house manufacturers, for instance. Originating in the US, tiny homes have also been popping up across Canada, Australia and <a href="http://www.tinyhouseuk.co.uk/">the UK</a>.</p>
<p class="body">Tiny houses are promoted as <a href="https://theconversation.com/tiny-houses-the-big-idea-that-could-take-some-heat-out-of-the-housing-crisis-77295">an answer</a> to the affordable housing crisis; a desirable alternative to traditional homes and mortgages. Yet there are many complexities and contradictions that surround these tiny spaces, as I discovered when I began investigating them.</p>
<p class="body">I have toured homes, attended tiny house festivals, stayed in a tiny house community and interviewed several dozen people who live inside them. My research took me throughout the US, from a converted accessory unit squeezed between two average size homes on Staten Island to a community in Florida full of cute and brightly coloured tiny structures – appropriately located just down the road from Disney World. Here are three things I unexpectedly discovered along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am sure there are thousands of people that are happy with their Tiny Houses. Go there and read. More next week.</p>

<p>The sun only shines during the day.</p>
<p>Geothermal can&#8217;t be done everywhere.</p>
<p>Heat Pumps only work in certain temperature ranges.</p>
<p>There will never be enough storage.</p>
<p>Storage will be too expensive.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t power an industrial society like this.</p>
<p>Then there is the big LIE, Nuclear Power is carbon free.</p>
<p>So much CARBON goes into a Nuclear Power Plant the it would never be carbon free&#8230;Not in a hundred years.</p>

<p>The buildings we live and work in have to meet a wide range of needs, whether it’s an office block in the middle of the city or a small house in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Think of a building’s temperature: It can be regulated by radiators, fans and air conditioning systems, while basic actions such as opening and closing a window or door can also be effective. Today, smart technology allows many of these appliances to be controlled remotely using smartphones.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You only need to look at your monthly utility bill to know that living in a building — be it large or small — costs money.</p>
<p>The impact of buildings on the environment is also a concern. According to the IEA, final energy use in buildings hit approximately 3,060 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2018, up from 2,820 Mtoe in 2010.</p>
<p>Fossil fuels’ share in buildings’ energy use was at 36% in 2018, the IEA says, a small drop compared to 38% in 2010.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am embarrassed to say that I have never heard of a mist shower. So I am putting this up as a very very long public service announcement. But if everything it says is true, I gotta get me one. It should be amazing.</p>

<h3 class="entry-header">Mist Showers: Sustainable Decadence?</h3>
<div class="entry-content">
<div class="entry-body">
<p>The daily shower would be hard to sustain in a world without fossil fuels. The mist shower, a satisfying but forgotten technology which uses very little water and energy, could be a solution. Designer Jonas Görgen developed a do-it-yourself kit to convert almost any shower into a mist shower and sent me one to try out.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://krisdedecker.typepad.com/.a/6a00e0099229e888330240a4be94e0200d-700wi" alt="Mist-shower-hack-kit" /></p>

<h2><strong>The Carbon Footprint of the Daily Shower</strong></h2>
<p>The shower doesn’t get much attention in the context of climate change. However, like <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2010/09/piston-powered-aircraft-as-fuel-efficient-as-current-average-jet.html">airplanes</a>, <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2008/06/citroen-2cv.html">cars</a>, and <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2015/02/heating-people-not-spaces.html">heating systems</a>, it has become a very wasteful and carbon-intensive way to provide for a basic need: washing the body. Each day, many of us pour roughly 70 litres of hot water over our bodies in order to be “clean”.</p>
<p>This practice requires two scarce resources: water and energy. More attention is given to the showers&#8217; high water consumption, but energy use is just as problematic. Hot water production accounts for the second most significant use of energy in many homes (after heating), and much of it is used for showering. Water treatment and distribution also use lots of energy.</p>
<p>In contrast to the energy used for space heating, which has decreased during the last decades, the energy used for hot water in households has been steadily growing. One of the reasons is that people are showering longer and more frequently, and using increasingly powerful shower heads. For example, in the Netherlands from 1992 to 2016, shower frequency increased from 0.69 to 0.72 showers per day, shower duration increased from 8.2 to 8.9 minutes, and the average water flow increased from 7.5 to 8.6 litres per minute. [1]</p>
<blockquote><p>In many industrial societies it&#8217;s now common to shower at least once per day</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Go there and read and read and read. I may never take a shower again. More next week.</p>

<p>When I moved from Brooklyn back to the Bay Area a few years ago, I thought, at first, that the apartment I found was charming. It’s also very small: At the end of a long driveway, inside a former garage, it’s 240 square feet, or roughly the size of one and a half parking spaces.</p>
</div>
</article>
<p>I still live there—partly because rents in Oakland have surged <a href="https://sf.curbed.com/2018/1/30/16950444/bay-area-rent-san-francisco-oakland-san-jose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more than 50%</a> in less than a decade, and in a neighborhood where a typical one-bedroom now goes for more than $2,800, I can’t afford to move. I recognize the value of this type of tiny house, called an accessory dwelling unit or ADU, in theory. In built-up cities with little extra land and residents who fight development, adding tiny cottages in backyards is one way to help address the housing shortage. The small size saves energy and curbs my shopping habits, since there literally isn’t any room for, say, another pair of shoes. But I also question how well tiny homes make sense as a solution for long-term housing—and in some cases, as in the even tinier houses sometimes used as housing for people experiencing homelessness, I wonder if they can sometimes distract from other, more systemic solutions that are necessary.</p>
<p>As tiny houses go, mine is larger than some. One nearby shed-like cottage currently for rent on Craigslist is 120 square feet; another, which rents for $1,600 a month, is 200 square feet. A few miles away from me, a village of 8-by-10-foot tiny houses on wheels is under construction for homeless youth, with a separate communal kitchen and communal bathrooms. Hundreds of others are currently living on the street in much tighter quarters in vehicles or tents. While there’s no official definition for a tiny house, they’re generally said to be around 500 or fewer square feet, making my place somewhat medium-size as far as tiny houses go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week&#8217;s articles says &#8211; Not Likely. I say the trees are a good start. The point is that some people argue for trees or solar panels in the desert for instance. But the desert is an ecosystem that trees or solar panels would disrupt. Deserts are not &#8220;throw away&#8221; ecosystems. So we can only deploy so much of each. This is why i think geothermal is the ultimate solution.</p>

<p>Last week, a new study in the journal <em><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Science (opens in a new tab)">Science</a></em> highlighted the role forests could play in <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2019/07/04/could-planting-tons-of-trees-solve-climate-change/#.XR9vR9NKjm1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="tackling climate change (opens in a new tab)">tackling climate change</a>. Researchers estimated that by restoring forests to their maximum potential, we could cut down atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) by 25 percent — a move that would take us back to levels not seen in over a century. Though the study brings hope in the fight against climate change, other experts warn the solution is not that simple.</p>
<p>The study, led by scientists at ETH-Zürich, Switzerland, determined the planet has 0.9 billion hectares of land available to hold more trees — an area the size of the continental U.S. Converting those areas into forests would be a game-changer for climate change, the authors suggested.</p>
<p>“[The study] is probably the best assessment we have to date of how much land could support tree cover on our planet,” says Robin Chazdon, a forest ecologist and professor emeritus at the University of Connecticut not involved in the study, But she is quick to point out that restoring forests is not as simple as it sounds.</p>

<p>Go there and think. More next week.</p>
