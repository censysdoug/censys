										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every once in awhile I return to CES&#8217; residential roots. So, here is another pass. You know what I say in these situations &#8211; Buyer Beware. This site looks really really good. I think it is sexy that it is a nonprofit organization. But I have never used this organization. I am a homeowner who has made very little in the way of energy IMPROVEments &#8211; insulation, metal roof and efficient air conditioner but the furnace in my house is 20 years old. Nonetheless these people look cool.</p>
<p><a href="https://zeroenergyproject.org/our-mission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://zeroenergyproject.org/our-mission/</a></p>
<p><strong>The Zero Energy Project is a non-profit educational organization whose goal is to help home buyers, builders, designers, and real estate professionals take meaningful steps</strong> towards radically reducing carbon emissions and energy bills by building zero net energy homes and near zero energy homes. We envision the day when positive energy homes, which produce more energy than they consume, will power electric vehicles as well as homes, so that everyone can live well with less expense and without fear of energy price spikes, while greatly reducing our carbon emissions.</p>
<div id="" class="col-sm-12 full-standard nobg slate cover">
<div class=" withtitle">
<div class="content withtitle">
<div class="singlecolumn">
<h3>The mission of the Zero Energy Project is to provide information and education to prospective home buyers, builders, designers, real estate professionals and advocates about zero net energy homes and to advance the prevalence of these homes in the mainstream housing market. We seek to facilitate connections between industry professionals and buyers, remove perceived barriers to entry, and provide resources to people from all walks of life, empowering action towards a robust zero energy built environment.</h3>

<p>This mission takes on new urgency in light of <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/global-warmings-terrifying-new-math-20120719" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Global Warming’s Terrifying New Math</a>.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the years I have gotten 100s of requests to post links with other Blogs and Internet Sites that are related to the things that I post about; Sometimes tangentially. Sometimes very tangentially. Below I am going to try to post some of those with the text of the request where applicable or sometimes just the link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am only one guy by the way. That is it, Community Energy Systems and Energy Tough Love is just one guy with 900 bucks in the bank&#8230;.so there is no way I can track down each post of mine and put the link on the page. Did I mention I was 63 years old. I would be dead by the time i did 10 or 20 post. Is some of this sarcastic? Well yah. But I never mean it spitefully. Please laugh with me not at me. Consider this:</p>
<p>Hello ,</p>
<p>My name is James Giraldo and I’m the Communications Manager on SaveOnEnergy.com®.</p>
<p>I wanted to point out this page: <a href="/censys/?m=200810" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">censys.org</a> which links to a broken kids energy page on <a href="http://www.miamisci.org/af/sln/frankenstein/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">miamisci.org</a></p>
<p>Our team has created a <a href="https://www.saveonenergy.com/kids-learning-center/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Kids Learning Center</a> which is filled with free resources similar to the ones previously found on that page. Please take a look, and if you find any of the content useful consider linking to it on your page, or perhaps use it to replace the broken link so your visitors don&#8217;t end up on that broken page.</p>
<p>Here is a hyperlink to our kids learning center:<br />
<a href="https://www.saveonenergy.com/kids-learning-center/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.saveonenergy.com/kids-learning-center/</a></p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your help and attention. Please let me know if you have questions or concerns that I can assist with.</p>
<p>James G.<br />
Communications Director<br />
6860 North Dallas Parkway, Suite 228 | Plano, TX 75024<br />
<a href="mailto:James@admin.saveonenergy.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">James@admin.saveonenergy.com</a><br />
www.saveonenergy.com</p>
<p>Or this:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Hi censys.org,</span></p>
<p>I was reading a page on your site and I noticed you had link pointing to a page that is broken (no longer valid) which I thought you might want to fix.</p>
<p>The broken link can be found at the middle of the page.  The page that has the broken link is:</p>
<p><a href="/censys/index.php?s=energy&amp;paged=27" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">/censys/index.php?s=energy&amp;paged=27</a></p>
<p>Attached is a screenshot with a circle around the broken link to make it easier to find.</p>
<p>Having broken links on your site isn’t good for your readers and also Google lowers your ranking score if you have them.  It would be awesome if you could replace the broken link with one of our related posts instead, if not, that is okay.</p>
<p><span class="u_b en_0 C4_Z2aVTcY" data-test-id="message-from"><span class="D_F rtlI_rtlI_dz_sSg "><span class="u_N C_Z1VRpVF"><a href="http:www.businesselectric.com">http:www.businesselectric.com</a></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><br />
If you would replace it with our link we would share the post with 14,000+ followers in our niche.  We are up for collaborating more with you or negotiating more about it.</span></p>
<p>Thanks for reading my email and have a nice day ?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Oliver</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I do not usually put up two opinions in one post. These are timely articles so I think it is important to hear both sides.

<p class="story-body__introduction">Cape Town is in the unenviable situation of being the first major city in the modern era to face the threat of running out of drinking water.</p>
<p>However, the plight of the drought-hit South African city is just one extreme example of a problem that experts have long been warning about &#8211; water scarcity.</p>
<p>Despite covering about 70% of the Earth&#8217;s surface, water, especially drinking water, is not as plentiful as one might think. Only 3% of it is fresh.</p>
<p>Over one billion people lack access to water and another 2.7 billion find it scarce for at least one month of the year. A 2014 survey of the world&#8217;s 500 largest cities estimates that one in four are in a situation of &#8220;water stress&#8221;</p>
<p>According to UN-endorsed projections, global demand for fresh water will exceed supply by 40% in 2030, thanks to a combination of climate change, human action and population growth.</p>

<h1 class="headline node-title">Severe water shortages around the world: Why the taps run dry</h1>
<div class="label-inline">Published</div>
<p>Feb 13, 2018, 7:30 pm SGT</p>
<p>PARIS (AFP) &#8211; The world has abundant freshwater but it is unevenly distributed and under increasing pressure, UN agencies say, as highlighted by the severe shortages in Cape Town.</p>
<h4>WATER, WATER &#8216;EVERYWHERE&#8217;</h4>
<p>More than 97 per cent of the planet&#8217;s water is salty, most of it in the oceans and seas, but there is also a good supply of freshwater.</p>
<p>Every year around 42.8 trillion cubic metres of renewable freshwater circulates as rain, surface water or groundwater, according to the UN&#8217;s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).</p>
<p>This equals 16,216 litres per person per day &#8211; four times the amount required in the United States, for example, for personal and domestic consumption, industry and agriculture.</p>
<p>Depending on diet and lifestyle, a person needs between 2,000 and 5,000 litres of water a day to produce their food and meet their drinking and sanitation requirements, the FAO says.</p>
<p>About 60 per cent of the planet&#8217;s freshwater reserves is locked in the Antarctic.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t even agree on how much water we have. Go there and read a lot. More next week.</p>

<p dir="ltr">There are many who want to buy an efficient and stable <a href="https://www.jenreviews.com/water-heater/">water heater</a> for their homes. But do they? Water heaters do the difficult job of heating the water supply of your home. Providing you with immediate hot water when needed through various fixtures and knobs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Like many other appliances, a water heater is more convenient than manually heating up the water whenever needed. It cuts back time and effort, for most homeowners, while making life simpler. So why do most people hurry when choosing the right water heater? Something this important needs careful consideration of features and functions.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">The best part about using the <a href="https://www.jenreviews.com/best-water-heater/">best water heater</a> is that it lasts for years. It requires minimal maintenance and even if you hire a professional to maintain one, it doesn’t cost you big bucks. That said, finding a dependable water heater isn’t easy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Because water is being constantly heated inside the tank, it needs to be energy efficient and spacious enough to accommodate the entire house. Anything that takes up more energy is a waste, costing you a hefty power bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So how do water heaters work?</p>

<p>Go there and read pages. More next week.</p>

<p>As cities grow and incomes rise around the world, more and more people are leaving gardens and traditional diets behind and eating refined sugars, refined fats, oils and resource- and land-intense agricultural products like beef. This global dietary transition is harming the health of both people and the planet, says new research.</p>
<p>But the study also shows that shifting away from this trajectory and choosing healthier traditional Mediterranean, pescatarian or vegetarian diets could not only boost human lifespans and quality of life, but also slash emissions and save habitat for endangered species.</p>
<p>And we better hurry; the scientists project that if the trend continues, the situation will be worse yet with greenhouse gas emissions up by 80 percent by 2050.</p>
<p>Examining almost 50 years’ worth of data from the world’s 100 most populous countries, University of Minnesota Professor of Ecology G. David Tilman and graduate student Michael Clark illustrate how current diet trends are contributing to ever-rising agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and habitat degradation.</p>
<p>On top of that, they write: “These dietary shifts are greatly increasing the incidence of Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and other chronic non-communicable diseases that lower global life expectancies.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was going to write about Germany making 85 percent of its power with renewables on a particular day. As fun as that is this is better.

<div></div>
<div class="meta grey">By Ahmed Megahid, The Arab Weekly   |   May 15, 2017 at 10:33 AM</div>
<p><span class="story_dl">CAIRO, May 15 (UPI) &#8212;</span> The vista in the central province of Minya is as empty as far as the eye can see except for rows and rows of solar panels and the blue sky above.</p>
<p>The panels are helping Amr al-Saad&#8217;s 8-month-old power sta­tion address the worsening issue of brownouts and blackouts in the area.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few years ago, power supply was intermittent, which made the life of the residents of the province very tough,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is why I decided to establish my project where it is most needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>After generating electricity, Saad&#8217;s station feeds it into the na­tional grid where it is used to power houses, farms and workshops in Minya&#8217;s villages.</p>
<p>Saad&#8217;s project, which cost $100,000 and produces 650 kilo­watts of electricity each month, is part of a national drive to reduce Egypt&#8217;s dependence on fossil fuels by shifting to renewable energy. Egypt plans to produce 20 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2022 and 37 percent by 2035. It is an ambitious plan given that just 3 percent of electricity produced annually in Egypt today is from renewable sources.</p>

</div>
<div class="entry">
<p>After doing some research on renewable energy systems or alternative energy systems as many will call them, I wanted to get the information out there as far as the advantages and disadvantages of the 2 main renewable energy systems, <a title="wind turbine generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind turbine generators</a> and <a title="photovoltaic solar panels" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">photovoltaic solar panels</a>.</p>
<p>Both <a title="solar panel" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panel</a> and <a title="wind generator systems" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator systems</a> are similar as far as how they are setup. You can have the <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> grid tied or off grid, same as <a title="solar panels" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panels</a>. Both the <a title="solar panel photovoltaic panel" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panel (photovoltaic panel)</a> and <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> will need a battery bank if you are using an off grid system. Both of these renewable energy systems will produce clean energy and help the environment as well as save you money in your home!</p>
<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Wind Generator Systems and Solar Panel Systems</h3>
<p>Now onto some of the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative energy system. None of this information is from my own personal experience as I do not have the financial funds to support the research. So the information about these renewable energy systems have came from researching the internet, talking to people that have these alternative energy systems, and of course some calculations of my own (prices, efficiency, etc.).</p>
<h3>Wind Turbine Generator System Pros and Cons</h3>
<p>The main advantage of <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> is that they can produce electricity day or night as long as there is wind. <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">Wind generators</a> need less space on your land to produce sufficient electricity. <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">Wind generators</a> are able to produce more electric for the same price. If you spend $1,000.00 on <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> you can produce 1kW – 2kW, with <a title="solar panels" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=solar-panel" target="_blank">solar panels</a> you may only produce around .5kW – .75kW with the same $1,000.00. <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generators" target="_blank">Wind generators</a> have moving parts, so there is always wear and tear on these moving parts. Bearings can go bad, propeller blades can be struck by objects, and heat may be generated. Your <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> will be installed on a tower or pole of some sort to gain height where there is more wind, allowing lighting to possibly strike your <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a>. As wind hits the propeller blades there will be noise created, think of a fan and how they sound, or even taking a rope and swinging it fast in circles. You will get some of this noise from your <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a>. The propellers of the <a title="wind generator" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator</a> can also produce shadows flickering. Birds can get killed from flying into your wind generator’s propellers. There are vertical <a title="wind generators" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generators</a> which will prevent this. So the quick break down of the <a title="wind generator system" href="http://gogreeninyourhome.com/product.php?id=wind-generator" target="_blank">wind generator system</a>:</p>

<p>Capping a week of 100<sup>th </sup>anniversary celebrations for the National Park Service, President Barack Obama on Friday turned to the ocean to create the largest protected area anywhere on Earth—a half-million-square-mile arc of remote Pacific waters known for both exceptional marine life and importance to native Hawaiian culture.</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>The Papah?naumoku?kea Marine National Monument, established in 2006 by President George W. Bush, already covered 140,000 square miles of ocean around the uninhabited northwestern islands of Hawaii, Obama’s home state. (<a href="http://www.papahanaumokuakea.gov/about/name.html" target="_blank">Learn about the name and how to pronounce it.</a>)</p>
</div>
<div class="text smartbody parbase section">
<p>Obama more than quadrupled Papah?naumoku?kea’s size, to 582,578 square miles, an area larger than all the national parks combined. Using his executive authority under the U.S. Antiquities Act, he extended most of the monument’s boundary—and its prohibition of commercial fishing—out to the 200-mile limit of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ).(<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/08/katahdin-woods-waters-national-monument-maine/">Read about a monument established this week in the Maine woods.</a>)</p>

<p>Organic farming methods help take carbon dioxide from the air and lock it in the soil – a process known as carbon sequestration.</p>
<p>Our brainy friends at the Soil Association have <a href="https://www.soilassociation.org/better-food/our-campaigns/save-our-soils/research-references/" target="_blank">calculated</a> that if all UK farmland converted to organic farming, at least 3.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide would be taken up by the soil each year.</p>
<p>Organic farming and renewable energy go hand-in-hand, so we’re thrilled to be teaming up with the Soil Association to sponsor <a href="http://www.goodenergy.co.uk/organic-september" target="_blank">Organic September</a> for the fourth year running.</p>

<p><strong>5 Things You Should Stop Throwing Away </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wastefulness has increased in modern times because consumers can find low-cost, disposable products made from inexpensive, easy-to-manufacture materials. These products harm the environment in a variety of ways:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>– Waste causes the destruction of forests and fields to create larger landfills.</p>
<p>– Biodegradable items in landfills decompose to create methane and other greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>– Burning trash creates harmful smoke that pollutes clean air.</p>
<p>– Animals eat plastics and plastic breakdown releases toxic chemicals into the ground and water supplies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Garbage bags, waste disposal trucks and landfills often contain items that people can effortlessly recycle, upcycle or reuse. You simply need to rethink how you deal with trash:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fruit and Vegetable Waste</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moldy or damaged fruit and vegetable waste is 100 percent biodegradable. In nature, waste plants feed microorganisms, insects and animals and decompose into plant soil nutrients. Instead of tossing whole fruits and vegetables or cuttings into the trash, make nutrient-rich composted fertilizer for your potted plants and garden. Drill a few out-gassing holes into the sides of a sturdy lidded container and then fill the container with starter soil, earthworms and leaves. Shred fruit and vegetable waste into small pieces and then add it to the container</p>
