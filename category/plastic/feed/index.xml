										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So the shell game for the oil companies was always &#8211; who can we get to take this stuff? Meaning solid supposedly recyclable plastics. For awhile anybody would take the &#8220;stuff&#8221; to burn it and Americans are like &#8211; out of sight out of mind. When they got caught at that, then they started exporting for &#8220;conversion&#8221; to other substances and China bought that one big time. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, plastic can be recycled but it is MORE expensive to do so than to throw it away. PLUS you can only recycle it once or twice and then it has to be thrown away anyway. YUP recycling was always a lie. But ain&#8217;t capitalism grand.</p>

<p>Laura Leebrick, a manager at Rogue Disposal &amp; Recycling in southern Oregon, is standing on the end of its landfill watching an avalanche of plastic trash pour out of a semitrailer: containers, bags, packaging, strawberry containers, yogurt cups.</p>
<p>None of this plastic will be turned into new plastic things. All of it is buried.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me that felt like it was a betrayal of the public trust,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I had been lying to people &#8230; unwittingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rogue, like most recycling companies, had been sending plastic trash to China, but when China shut its doors two years ago, Leebrick scoured the U.S. for buyers. She could find only someone who wanted white milk jugs. She sends the soda bottles to the state.</p>
<p>But when Leebrick tried to tell people the truth about burying all the other plastic, she says people didn&#8217;t want to hear it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember the first meeting where I actually told a city council that it was costing more to recycle than it was to dispose of the same material as garbage,&#8221; she says, &#8220;and it was like heresy had been spoken in the room: You&#8217;re lying. This is gold. We take the time to clean it, take the labels off, separate it and put it here. It&#8217;s gold. This is valuable.&#8221;</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>Go there and read. Next time you see an empty gallon milk jug. Light it on fire in protest. More next week.</p>
<p>:}</p>
<p>P.S. Today is recycling day in Riverton and they just took my plastic away. hahahahaa</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In all fairness the headline should read TRYS to clean ocean. Why do I even cover this story? Well plastic is a really really energy intensive industry. Second we made a big point of the Dutch Boy&#8217;s attempt to clean up the north Pacific Gyre. So it is only far to point out when industry is trying too. Though to be fair Sparkling Water tackled a much smaller  (some would say manageable) problem.</p>

<p><b><i>CEO Daniel Birnbaum Leads 300 SodaStream Executives from Around the World, Local Youth and Environmental NGOs to Clean Caribbean Sea and Roatán Shores</i></b></p>
<p>AIRPORT CITY, <span class="xn-location">Israel</span>, <span class="xn-chron">Oct. 15, 2018</span> /PRNewswire/ &#8212; SodaStream International Ltd. (NASDAQ: <a href="http://studio-5.financialcontent.com/prnews?Page=Quote&amp;Ticker=SODA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SODA</a>) today announced the launch of the &#8220;Holy Turtle&#8221; &#8211; a massive ocean contraption designed to clean plastic waste from open waters. The innovative device will be initially piloted today in the Caribbean Sea, off the coast of Roatán, <span class="xn-location">Honduras</span>, as part of a bold ocean clean-up lead by CEO <span class="xn-person">Daniel Birnbaum</span>. This is the first-known attempt of a commercial company to undertake a physical clean-up of trash from open waters. SodaStream&#8217;s clean-up delegation includes 150 SodaStream executives from 45 countries, international environmental specialists, NGO Plastic Soup Foundation and hundreds of children from 7 different local schools with local Honduran government officials.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1">
<p>The &#8220;Holy Turtle&#8221; is a 1,000 ft. long floating unit designed to be gently towed by two marine vessels along kilometers of open waters. The contraption is uniquely engineered to capture floating waste while its large vent holes act to protect wildlife. The device design was inspired by oil spill containment systems and was developed by ABBCO in <span class="xn-location">Florida, USA</span>, who are leading experts in oil spill containment.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1">
<p>SodaStream&#8217;s Roatán initiative was inspired by a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-41866046/the-giant-mass-of-plastic-waste-taking-over-the-caribbean" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">video</a> filmed by <span class="xn-person">Caroline Powers</span> in <span class="xn-chron">October 2017</span> featured on BBC highlighting underwater photography of a floating trash patch off the <span class="xn-location">Caribbean</span> coast of Roatán. Moved by the disturbing video, SodaStream CEO, <span class="xn-person">Daniel Birnbaum</span>, himself an experienced skipper and naval officer, lead a search for a solution to clean up this floating waste. Birnbaum noted, &#8220;We can&#8217;t clean up all the plastic waste on the planet, but we each need to do whatever we can. The most important thing is to commit ourselves to stop using single-use plastic.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Joost Dubois was just 20 he pledged to find away to get the plastic out of the ocean. He formed a nonprofit organization in Holland to do just that. All of the scientists and the environmentalists said he was crazy and too young anyway. He raised money (couple of million) and got sponsors. Hired engineers and experts and tried dozens of systems. Now he is 24. His first system is ready for testing. Still the science and environment communities say he is crazy&#8230;did i mention too young.</p>
<p>You know what I say? GOOD LUCK! Young man and God Speed.</p>
<p>Please note the video is pretty cool too.</p>

Once it arrives, the wind and waves will push System 001 into a U-shape and it will slowly drift along on its own. A 10-foot long skirt hanging below will collect pieces of plastic as small as a millimeter in size, and smaller boats will later scoop them up and take them to shore for recycling.</p>
