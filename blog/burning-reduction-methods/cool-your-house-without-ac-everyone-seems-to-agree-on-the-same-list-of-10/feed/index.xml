					<description><![CDATA[As forgot to add, maintainence of the system. Changing filters every 3 months, using pleated filters, not the $2 pieces of junk. For air/air condensing (outdoor coil) units, spraying them down with water once a month is very helpful for heat expulsion efficency and helps take stress off the compressor. Having someone look at the evaporator coil (indoor) every 3 years to make sure that is clean is highly advisible. Unless you know 100% what you are doing with this coil, I would not suggest doing it yourself. Damaging the distributer tubes and metering device can occur.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While I do agree with many things in this article, there is one thing that is not taken into consideration, humidity (natural that is, not generated). The use of trees and shading of windows is a great idea. In fact I always suggest that to customers. Back to humidity, with fans you&#039;ll still need to be in diret line of the airflow to feel the effects of cooling. Even with this the max cooling effect will only be the wet bulb temp (can be as low as 67 degs, but this is with 80 deg dry bulb and 50% relative humidity). The higher the humidity, the higher the WB. As to bowls of ice in front of a fan, this is not removing heat. When the ice melts, the heat is rereleased to the house again. Plus think of the costs of making the ice. Ceiling fans can be used to assist an AC unit, as they will help circulate the air in the house and help reduce stratification. Setting the t-stat higher can help, and for programmable t-stats, setting the temp 3-4 degs higher when the house is unoccupied is efficient. Higher settings is inefficient because it makes the AC work a little longer. A major common problem with AC systems is return air design. Leaky return ducts and a centrally located return grills is a real killer of efficiency. Each room should have a return and gaps in the duct should be filled. Sharp turns in the duct affect the airflow back to the unit.]]></description>
