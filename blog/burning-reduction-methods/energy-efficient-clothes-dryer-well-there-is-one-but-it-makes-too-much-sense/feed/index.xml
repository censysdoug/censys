					<description><![CDATA[You have explained very well the European and American style options to dry clothes. I also suggest not electric drying your clothes because over time it weakens the fabric and resins of the fabrics in turn making clothes look old in a short period of time. Drying them in the sun is the best option.  
Portable clotheslines, racks and folding frames are readily available in the marketplace; you just need to see which one best fits your space and looks good, as well.http://www.breezedryer.com]]>/</description>
