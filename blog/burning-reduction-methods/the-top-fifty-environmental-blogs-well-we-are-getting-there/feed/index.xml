					<description><![CDATA[Hi!

In response to your most recent blog.

I am indeed a greening and environmental expert – simply creatively marketed. www.gardeningnude.com is a website which provides green tips and ideas for simple living and green lifestyle living. The title is based on the green living book I wrote with the same title.

Would love to learn more about you and how you are educating on environmentalism and sustainability.

Best wishes,


Shawna Coronado
