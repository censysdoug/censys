					<description><![CDATA[Just foud this article. Actually you can use the geo for comfort control to preheat your hot water. This requires a buffer tank, but will heat the water to approx. 90 degrees. In the winter it will draw heat from the ground. In the summer it will use the heat extracted from the house. As to a refrigerator, yeah you&#039;ll need a separate heat pump due to the reversing cycle between heating and cooling.]]></description>
