One more thing...

I’m working with a coalition to make sure Congress sends the president a strong energy bill with meaningful changes for our environment and planet. This legislation would be a monumental step toward stopping global warming. Please go to http://www.energybill2007.us/ and sign the petition.  And, please, if you would, tell your readers as well.

That’s because after years of inaction, Congress finally has a chance to pass meaningful energy legislation. The bill they are about to pass includes the best fuel economy standards ever (35 mpg by 2020) and a renewable electricity standard (15% by 2020) that guarantees the growth of renewable, clean energy. But there is a chance these two key advances won’t make it through to the final bill.  This is our chance for real progress, don’t let Congress back down.

And I enjyoyed talking with you.  Thanks!]]></description>
