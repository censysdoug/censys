					<description><![CDATA[a reader of this post sent this to me by email...i encouraged him to register and post this comment himself but he didn&#039;t seem to think it was worth the effort so here are his thoughts:

I don&#039;t know if you are ill informed or just a misty eyed believer or just a
shyster?

Turbines do kill birds,,,protected birds and lots of them. Are you aware
that the Altamont wind farm has been sued to shutdown 4 month of the year to
prevent the killing of hundreds of PROTECTED Golden Eagles? They also kill
the declining stock of burrowing owls, protected peregrine falcons, hawks in
the thousands every year. Hunter kill birds that are allowed and are
punished if they kill things they shouldn&#039;t. Please don&#039;t give me the tired
logic of well birds die other ways. That is like saying people get murdered
so I can go kill other people. Golden Eagles are protected and other
industrial sources get punished if they harm them. You can go to jail for
killing eagles. Wind Turbine need to be sited in smart location. Or don&#039;t
you care as long as you get the money. I am currently fighting a 400 tall
wind turbine being proposed for a National Park. Are you in favor of
building over our National Parks.because your other cheerleading wind
turbine enthusiasts are.that is after they cut down the tree for biomass
burning.]]></description>
