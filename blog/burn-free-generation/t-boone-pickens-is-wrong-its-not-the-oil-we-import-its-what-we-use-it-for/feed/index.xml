					<description><![CDATA[Taking advantage of reusable bags is such an easy way to do something helpful, it&#039;s unfortunate I don&#039;t see many do it in my area (62704). I often hear from people that they own some, but forget them often. My solution is the chicobag. They collapse into a built-in pouch that literally fits into the palm of your hand, and they have a clip that lets you easily clip them on a belt-loop. I keep 3 in my car center console and clip them on my belt when shopping. They hold up well and are strong!

No I don&#039;t work for them, but I get so many positive comments on them I thought I&#039;d pass the link:
