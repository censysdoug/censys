										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More next Fall. HAHA Took me three extra months to return. Sorry did not EVEN think about posting until now.</p>
<p>First, of let me say I am now cancer free. Second, let me say that taking a break away from posting because of the cancer and the cancer treatment left me fairly lazy, so it is tough getting back to writing these posts. The thought has occurred to me that I might retire at the end of the year. Anyway it is good to be back for now. So without further adieu:</p>

Laryngeal cancer symptoms include voice changes, such as hoarseness, and a sore throat or cough that doesn’t go away. Treatment may include surgery to remove part or all of the larynx, called a laryngectomy. You can reduce your risk of laryngeal cancer by avoiding tobacco products.</div>

<p>Laryngeal cancer is cancer of the larynx, part of the throat. Cancer happens when specific cells grow uncontrollably. As the cells multiply, they invade and damage the body. In laryngeal cancer, these cancerous (malignant) cells start in the larynx (voice box).</p>

He has derailed the stringent Climate Change provisions of Built Back Better bill, and acted like it was a boon that he voted for a Black Woman to the Supreme Court. He is a waste of human space. Joe Manchin helped a West Virginia power plant that is the sole customer of his private coal business. Along the way, he blocked ambitious climate action.</p>

<p>This article is from the NY Times but its tagline would not load up so I used the one above. from politico. I think if you click on the author you may get through. In fact I clicked on the active author link and it took me right through so you get 2 articles for the nonprice of 1.</p>

<p class="css-g5piaz evys1bk0">The Grant Town power plant is also the link between the coal industry and the personal finances of Joe Manchin III, the Democrat who rose through state politics to reach the United States Senate, where, through the vagaries of electoral politics, he is now <a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/19/climate/manchin-climate-biden.html?searchResultPosition=21">the single most important figure</a> shaping the nation’s energy and climate policy.</p>
<p class="css-g5piaz evys1bk0">Mr. Manchin’s ties to the Grant Town plant date to 1987, when he had just been elected to the West Virginia Senate, a part-time job with base pay of $6,500. His family’s carpet business was struggling.</p>
<p class="css-g5piaz evys1bk0">Opportunity arrived in the form of two developers who wanted to build a power plant in Grant Town, just outside Mr. Manchin’s district. Mr. Manchin, whose grandfather went to work in the mines at age 9 and whose uncle died in a mining accident, helped the developers clear bureaucratic hurdles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>But we’re also far from totally unf$@%*ed!”</p>
<p>I am quoting here. I always try to stay positive and I know regular readers find that hard to believe because I have been saying for awhile that Human&#8217;s will go extinct. Still I like to think that my Stepson Gus, and my nieces and nephews like Taylor and Cory will have pleasant lives of their own. I hope that their kids will too. So here is an article that spreads some of that positivity.</p>
<p>This article is from last year but, spread the old news, same as the new news.</p>

<p>The deadly consequences of climate change only grew clearer this year, as record-shattering <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/11/climate/deaths-pacific-northwest-heat-wave.html">heat waves</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/09/02/heres-what-made-new-york-city-flooding-so-devastating/">floods</a>, and wildfires <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/world/asia/china-flooding-deaths.html">killed</a> <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-mediterranean-heatwaves-excess-deaths-climate-change-cop26-glasgow-ipcc/">thousands</a> and strained the limits of our disaster responders.</p>
<p>In the closing days of 2021, scientists <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/978762">warned</a> that the eastern ledge of a Florida-size glacier is about to snap off of Antarctica and US legislators found they may have <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/12/joe-biden-joe-manchin-climate-deal/621092/">flubbed their best chance</a> in a decade to enact sweeping climate policies.</p>

<div class="gutenbergContent__content--1FgGp html_2">
<p>But amid these stark signs, there were also indications that momentum is beginning to build behind climate action. Indeed, there’s good reason now to believe that the world could at least sidestep the worst dangers of global warming.</p>
<p>Princeton energy researcher Jesse Jenkins accurately, and colorfully, pinpointed the weird moment we’ve arrived at in <a href="https://twitter.com/JesseJenkins/status/1470398603336335364?s=20">a recent tweet</a>: “We’re no longer totally f$%@ed. But we’re also far from totally unf$@%*ed!”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know I write about all kinds of things like: the Russian Invasion of Ukraine or environmental disasters. But where this Blog started out was in the residential market. You know all the boring stuff. Improved air conditioning, or painting your roof white or insulating your water heater. Then I veer off in to &#8220;bugs that eat plastics&#8221; or Wind Turbines when I should be talking about energy efficient appliances. So without further ado here are 15 ways to use energy more better in your home.</p>

<h1 class="entry-title fusion-post-title">Top 15 Home Energy Efficiency Upgrades and Their Costs in 2021</h1>
<p>Energy efficiency is not just a trend that people with money follow because it’s cool to be green. No. It’s a real way to reduce your carbon footprint and your monthly costs in the long run.</p>
<p>It’s true that big changes like switching to solar energy require significant investments but you will recover and even save money in the upcoming years.</p>
<p>Enough talking, let’s see exactly what can be done to make your house more energy efficient. It’s recommended to start with little things and work your way up to the most expensive changes.</p>
<p><strong>Maximize the use of natural light</strong></p>
<p>The first thing to do to lower your energy bill is let the light in (obviously). For that purpose, install large windows.</p>
<p>Avoid light blocking treatments and use instead shades that can be opened at will. This way, you get darkness and light whenever you want. Place mirrors on the walls adjacent or opposite to windows. The idea is to have many reflective surfaces that create the illusion of light and spaciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Install energy efficient windows</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are however safer Nuclear Reactors. But the real drawback is that even France &#8211; that spent 600 million Euro son there&#8217;s &#8211;  gave up their research one 2 years ago.  So Bill Gates may be one of the smartest men on the planet, but for a badly mixed metaphor, he is barking up the wrong tree. Since sodium remains liquid at high temperatures &#8211; instead of turning into steam &#8211; sodium reactors do not need the heavy pressurized hulls of PWRs. But sodium burns on contact with air and explodes when plunged into water. Like I said &#8220;safer&#8221; reactor. Then as always, there is the problem with what to do with the fuel.</p>

<p>KEMMERER, Wyoming (AP) — In this sleepy Wyoming town that has relied on coal for over a century, a company founded by the man who revolutionized personal computing is launching an ambitious project to counter climate change: A nationwide reboot of nuclear energy technology.</p>
<p>Until recently, Kemmerer was little-known for anything except J.C. Penney&#8217;s first store and some 55-million-year-old fish fossils in quarries down the road.</p>
<p>Then in November, a company started by Bill Gates, TerraPower, announced it had chosen Kemmerer for a nontraditional, sodium-cooled nuclear reactor that will bring on workers from a local coal-fired power plant scheduled to close soon.</p>
<p>The demonstration project comes as many U.S. states see <a class="link " href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-business-environment-and-nature-bill-gates-nuclear-power-90689f06e1cf0271710e07e8b3ba8e09" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:nuclear emerging as an answer to fill the gap" data-rapid_p="8" data-v9y="1">nuclear emerging as an answer to fill the gap</a> as a transition away from coal, oil and natural gas to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Many residents in Kemmerer, where the population of 2,700 is little-changed since the 1990s, see the TerraPower project as a much-needed economic boost because Rocky Mountain Power&#8217;s Naughton power plant will close 2025. The plant employs about 230 and a mine that supplies coal exclusively to the plant — and is also at risk of closing if it can&#8217;t find another customer — almost 300.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If it means kicking Putin out of Ukraine then I am willing to pay whatever at the pump. Seriously I have advocated for dropping a Tactical Nuke on Chernobyl for a while. Ever since this current conflict begin. This for two reasons. One, it would clean out the radioactive mess there and turn out the lights on southern Russian. Two it would get Putin&#8217;s attention and maybe even get him thrown from power. Is it radical? HELL yes, but tough times require tough decisions. NUKE em I say.</p>

<ul class="body-ul">
<li><strong>Geopolitical tensions, inflation, and the COVID-19 pandemic have converged to push the average U.S. price for a gallon of gasoline above $4 for the first time since 2008, as calculated by the price-monitoring app GasBuddy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>In some cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, average gas prices have hit $5 for regular fuel—the photo above was taken in Santa Ana, California, on March 6—and there are even some stations selling premium for over $7 a gallon. On the <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AAA Gas Prices website</a>, you can look at the averages in the state where you live. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Unless something drastic changes soon, <a href="https://www.gasbuddy.com/newsroom/pressrelease/2022/03/05/1103" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GasBuddy</a> is predicting a national average price of $4.25 by Memorial Day. The current record is $4.10. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="body-text"><strong><em>UPDATE 3/8/2022: </em></strong><em><a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AAA said</a> the average U.S. price for a gallon of gasoline has hit $4.173, which is the most expensive ever. That&#8217;s up 10 cents per gallon since yesterday and up 63 cents since February 24 (the date on which Russia began its invasion of Ukraine).</em></p>
<p class="body-text">The news everybody already seems to know is that gas prices are headed up. This weekend, the national average price for a gallon of gasoline went above $4 a gallon in the U.S for only the second time ever. The last time this happened was in 2008.</p>

<p>Russia&#8217;s economy is &#8220;incredibly unimportant in the global economy except for oil and gas,&#8221; Jason Furman, a Harvard economist and former advisor to President Barack Obama, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/21/business/economy/ukraine-russia-economy.html?smid=tw-share" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="3833ffc99460c6de181a669dc35eb096">The New York Times.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s basically a big gas station,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His comments come as the West prepares <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/21/statement-by-press-secretary-jen-psaki-on-russian-announcement-on-eastern-ukraine/" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="7bd2d70c52d7b2017ceccb055122336e">heavy sanctions</a> on Russia if it invades Ukraine. While they have the potential to throw the Russian economy into chaos, these measures could also reverberate to further damage the US, Europe, and the rest of the world as they battle inflation and rising energy prices — a ripple effect that the West hopes to mitigate.</p>
<p>On Monday, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/map-where-are-donetsk-luhansk-ukraine-russia-2022-2" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="f1a4c149a6bb8c3977ad89ca46bfbafb">Moscow declared the independence of two breakaway regions of Ukraine and sent troops there</a> — escalating the prospect of a major war. President Joe Biden has already <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-orders-sanctions-russia-backed-eastern-ukraine-separatist-regions-2022-2" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="bf7125005aab9537167f85ca2b703e20">ordered sanctions</a> on the separatist regions — Donetsk and Luhansk — prohibiting US citizens from engaging in any exports, imports, or new investments in these areas.</p>
<p>Despite Russia&#8217;s size and wealth in raw materials, its economy is more on par with Brazil than with nations like Germany, France, and the UK, <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?most_recent_value_desc=false" data-analytics-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="60" data-uri="8081f643505061a94e157a69ddaf0bbb">according to the latest nominal GDP data from the World Bank.</a> According to the World Bank, Russia&#8217;s economy is smaller than Italy&#8217;s and South Korea&#8217;s, two nations with less than half of Russia&#8217;s population.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let me say 3 things right off the bat. 1. This is a really really long article. 2. They only spend, like a paragraph on <em>Ideonella sakaiensis.</em> 3. They argue that enzyme recycling is feasible and I am not sure of that. About that single paragraph however, why don&#8217;t they let the little creatures eat the plastic and then do something with them? Is that too hard to grasp. I mean maybe they make good fertilizer? Anyway right now plastic is getting into everything including our bodies, so they better find something to do with it fast. Feeding it too microscopic organisms sound good to me.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="bolded">ince the first</span> factories began manufacturing polyester from petroleum in the 1950s, humans have produced an estimated 9.1 billion tons of plastic. Of the waste generated from that plastic, less than a tenth of that has been recycled, researchers <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700782">estimate</a>. About 12 percent has been incinerated, releasing dioxins and other carcinogens into the air. Most of the rest, a mass equivalent to about 35 million blue whales, has accumulated in landfills and in the natural environment. Plastic inhabits the oceans, building up in the guts of seagulls and great white sharks. It rains down, in tiny flecks, on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412019330351/">cities</a> and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaz5819">national parks</a>. According to some research, from production to disposal, it is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions <a href="https://theconversation.com/plastic-warms-the-planet-twice-as-much-as-aviation-heres-how-to-make-it-climate-friendly-116376">than the aviation industry</a>.</p>
<p>This pollution problem is made worse, experts say, by the fact that even the small share of plastic that does get recycled is destined to end up, sooner or later, in the trash heap. Conventional, thermomechanical recycling — in which old containers are ground into flakes, washed, melted down, and then reformed into new products — inevitably yields products that are more brittle, and less durable, than the starting material. At best, material from a plastic bottle might be recycled this way about three times before it becomes unusable. More likely, it will be “downcycled” into lower value materials like clothing and carpeting—materials that will eventually be disposed of in landfills.</p>

<p>“Thermomechanical recycling is not recycling,” said Alain Marty, chief science officer at Carbios, a French company that is developing alternatives to conventional recycling.</p>
<p>“At the end,” he added, “you have exactly the same quantity of plastic waste.”</p>
<p>Carbios is among a contingent of startups that are attempting to commercialize a type of <a href="https://cefic.org/a-solution-provider-for-sustainability/chemical-recycling-making-plastics-circular/">chemical recycling known as depolymerization,</a> which breaks down polymers — the chain-like molecules that make up a plastic — into their fundamental molecular building blocks, called monomers. Those monomers can then be reassembled into polymers that are, in terms of their physical properties, as good as new. In theory, proponents say, a single plastic bottle could be recycled this way until the end of time.</p>
