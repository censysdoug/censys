<p><strong>P</strong>resident-elect Joe Biden has an unprecedented opportunity to walk the U.S.—and perhaps the world—back from the brink on climate change. After four years of harmful deregulation, his work is cut out for him.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 icxCgE">But to truly address climate change will require more than simply repealing President Donald Trump’s rollbacks and maybe strengthening a few rules on power plant emissions before calling it a day. Because climate change is an everything problem, the entire and considerable weight of the federal government will need to be thrown into addressing it. Like rowing competition, the race to address climate change can only be won if everyone is pulling in the same direction.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 icxCgE">This “all of government” response to the crisis at hand is the only way to ensure a shot at keeping the globe from heating up more than the 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) goal outlined in the Paris Agreement, to say nothing of the 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) target outlined in a <a class="sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 kVnoAv js_link" href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/we-have-a-decade-to-prevent-a-total-climate-disaster-1829585748" data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://earther.gizmodo.com/we-have-a-decade-to-prevent-a-total-climate-disaster-1829585748&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]">landmark United Nations report</a>. Over the next four years, Biden will have to center climate change at every agency, from the obvious ones like the Environmental Protection Agency to others like the Department of Education and Treasury.</p>
<p class="sc-77igqf-0 icxCgE">Earther has pulled together ideas and actions federal agencies can take to address climate change, based on conversations with dozens of experts who know the federal government’s levers of power and how to pull them so that they’re all geared to lower emissions. The ideas below are not exhaustive nor do they include solutions that can be applied at all agencies such as installing climate advocates at all levels, using procurement to electrify the government vehicle fleet, and diversifying the workforce so that new problem solvers are welcomed into the fold. But they do represent some of the best ones out there for how to get the ship turned quickly.</p>

<p>Go there and rejoice. More next week.</p>
