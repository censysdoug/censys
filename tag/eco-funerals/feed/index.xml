										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Earth Awareness Fair was this last weekend and I should be reporting on that. But these two women were there, Clada Parker and Jenn Bormann. They are with Roselawn Memorial Park and Butler Funeral home respectively. I am going to do Roselawn today and Butler tomorrow. I just love these guys. They had a woven basket casket with an optional silk liner with them on Saturday. But they have so many options it is real exciting. This is their Facebook page and their website:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Roselawn-Memorial-Park/121946907815445">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Roselawn-Memorial-Park/121946907815445</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.roselawninfo.com/">http://www.roselawninfo.com/</a></p>
<p>And here is a great little write up on them:</p>

<h2><a title="Permanent Link to Are There Green Cemeteries in Illinois?" href="http://wakethememory.com/blog/are-there-green-cemeteries-in-illinois/" rel="bookmark"> Are There Green Cemeteries in Illinois?</a></h2>
<div>July 19th, 2010</div>
<p>I am happy to report that the answer is finally, <strong>YES</strong>!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Green Burial Council</em> in California recently approved Roselawn Memorial Park for green burials. You can now be buried in Illinois without a casket, without embalming, without anything but a shroud if you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not personally think that a green burial ground has to be approved by the Green Burial Council, but they have some strict standards that make sense, and their mission is great. In a previous life, I worked in the architectural world, and saw first-hand what it was like dealing with the logistics of becoming LEED certified, and know how hard it can be. Additionally, it is very expensive to become “Certified Organic”. I think it’s worthwhile to recognize any cemetery or burial product willing to become more natural, and I will support any company that tries to be better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is their information. They do not seem to have a working website yet. I will keep you posted and update after I contact them directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Roselawn Memorial Park</strong> – Hybrid Cemetery<br />
924 South 6th Street<br />
Springfield IL 62703<br />
